Abstract = {{Interpretation of national-scale surveys is needed to determine long
   term impacts of land use on soil quality. We report the findings of a
   survey of soil quality in New Zealand conducted 1995-2001. The survey
   covered 511 sites representative of 98\% of New Zealand's land area.
   Land uses included: arable cropping and horticulture, mixed cropping.
   drystock pasture (sheep, beef or deer), dairy pasture, tussock
   grassland, plantation forestry. and indigenous forest, occurring on 12
   soil orders. At each site, land-use and soil profile were described. and
   the topsoil (0-10 cm depth) analyzed for total C, total N, anaerobically
   mineralisable N, pH, Olsen P, bulk density and macroporosity. Pastoral
   land and indigenous forests had similar total C contents (56-67 mg
   cm(-3)). Mean N contents under pastures were 4.3-5.9 ma cm(-3), whereas
   all other land uses were <3.5 mg cm(-3). Olsen P was much greater under
   pastures and cropping (44-49 ma cm(-3)) than under plantation and
   indigenous forests (ca. 10 mg cm(-3)). Indigenous and plantation forest
   soils were the most acidic (mean pH 5.4), and cropping soils the most
   alkaline (mean pH 6.2). Indigenous forests had the lowest bulk density,
   (0.76 Mg m(-3)). and mixed cropping soils the highest (1.22 Mg m(-3)).
   Macroporosity was variable (9.3-25.6\% (v/v)). Overall, 80\% of the soil
   properties fell within target ranges identified as desirable to maintain
   soil quality for production and environmental objectives. There was
   widespread but moderate compaction under pastures and cropping.
   depletion of total C tinder cropping, and nutrient imbalance (usually
   excess P) under cropping and dairy pastures. The study identified soil.
   land use and management combinations of concern for loss of soil
   quality, and provided benchmark data against which to measure change.

Abstract = {{Despite growing concern about the potential adverse effects of elevated
   cobalt concentrations in the environment, hardly any toxicity data are
   available for terrestrial invertebrates. Therefore, chronic toxicity of
   cobalt was assessed for the springtail Folsomia candida. The 28-day EC50
   for the reproduction of F candida was 1480 mg Co/kg dry wt in standard
   artificial soil (OECD) and 409 mg Co/kg dry wt in standard field soil
   (LUFA 2.2). The difference in toxicity can be explained by the higher pH
   and cation exchange capacity which decreased cobalt bioavailability in
   the OECD soil. When expressed as pore water concentrations, 28-day EC50s
   were similar: 159 mg Co/L in OECD and 174 mg Co/L in LUFA 2.2, which
   corresponded with calculated CO2+ activities of 0.953 and 1.20 mmol/L,
   respectively. Although the presented data can be considered as a step
   forward in the assessment of the potential risk of cobalt in the
   terrestrial environment, more toxicity data for different species are
   needed to evaluate the environmental risk of cobalt in soils. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Soil and litter arthropods are important in many forest ecosystem
   processes where they help to regulate nutrient dynamics and soil
   quality, and are useful bioindicators of ecosystem condition and change.
   This study was initiated in response to concerns about possible decline
   in site productivity due to intensive forestry practices. We
   investigated the effects of tree harvesting and site preparation
   treatments on soil and litter arthropod abundance in a loblolly pine
   plantation in eastern Texas, USA. Using soil and litter cores, we
   sampled abundance of selected arthropods over two years following tree
   harvesting. Response to treatments varied somewhat among arthropod taxa.
   Acari (mites) and Collembola (springtails), the numerically dominant
   taxa in core samples, were initially higher in abundance in less
   intensive harvesting and site preparation treatments. However, after 2
   years, abundance of these arthropods was comparable in all harvesting
   and site preparation treatments. Fertilization with nitrogen and
   phosphorus had a strong positive effect on abundance of most arthropod
   groups in the second year of the study. The recovery of arthropod
   abundance through time suggests that the silvicultural practices used
   did not jeopardize the ecological integrity of the site. The results
   reported here contrast with other similar studies which suggests that
   soil and litter arthropod communities respond differently in different
   geographic locations and forest types. Further comparative and extensive
   studies of this nature are needed therefore for a deeper understanding
   of the impacts of forest management practices. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted in Puerto Rico to evaluate the impact of
   compost on soil quality and crop production in an ultisol. In
   particular, the effect of compost on the quality of soil organic mater
   (SOM) was investigated. Compost quantities of 0, 37, 74 and 148 Mg
   ha(-1) were applied annually for 3 years to four different plots and a
   high single dose of compost was applied (444 Mg ha(-1)) to a separate
   plot in the first year of the experiment. Surface soil samples were
   collected from the five treatments 1, 2, and 3 years after compost
   application. Soil humic substances were extracted, fractionated and
   purified. The humic and fulvic acids (HA and FA) were studied to
   determine SOM quality. The following parameters were determined: (i)
   C-HA/C-FA ratio, (ii) E-4/E-6 ratio, (iii) Kumada classification of the
   humic acids, and (iv) fluorescence spectra. Higher compost application
   rates resulted in greater C-HA/C-FA and E-4/E-6 ratios (more
   humification and aromaticity) and a shift of fluorescence spectra to
   longer wavelength (with more functional groups). The results showed that
   composting produced statistically significant (alpha = 0. 05) changes in
   the C-HA/C-FA and E-4/E-6 ratios. The fluorescence spectra also showed
   considerable changes. Additions of compost to soil increased the quality
   of SOM by increasing the quantity of HA with more functional groups and
   aromacity. Our research demonstrated that addition of compost not only
   increased the quantity, but also the quality of SOM, thus improving soil
   quality and productivity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the process of opencast mining, several changes occur in physical,
   chemical, and microbiological proper-ties of soil as a result of mining
   and storage. Inability to preserve topsoil is one of the basic
   hindrances to restoration of mined land. The acute problem in preserving
   mine soil is discussed. Every year large areas are continually becoming
   unfertile in spite of efforts to grow vegetation on the degraded mined
   land One large opencast coal project of Eastern Coalfields Ltd. (ECL) is
   investigated to assess the deterioration of soil properties due to
   stripping and stockpiling. Different age classes of mine soil dumps are
   identified for the study. Mine soil characteristics of the dumps are
   compared with those of unmined soil and analyzed critically to evaluate
   deterioration of soil properties with respect to time of stockpiling.
   The changes in soil quality were found to be drastic in the first year,
   and continually deteriorating every year, and ultimately the soil became
   unfertile.}},

   mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Glomus macrocarpum and two sampling periods:
   soybean flowering and maturity. Microbial biomass C, soil respiration
   and the activity of three soil enzymes (deshydrogenase. alkaline
   phosphatase and arilsulphatase) were determined. The most affected
   enzyme was alkaline phophatase, whose activity was reduced in 60\%. and
   which was a sensible indicator of the microbial metabolic stress caused
   by high Pb concentrations. Soybean mycorrhization directly influenced
   the rhizospheric microbiota leading to higher activity and biomass.
   mainly at soybean maturity stage. Soil microbiota showed stress symptoms
   due to Pb addition to soil.}},

Abstract = {{Cover crops offer many benefits for farmers seeking to reduce their
   reliance on external inputs. These include maintaining and improving
   soil quality, preventing erosion and, in some cases. allelopathic weed
   control. Allelopathic potential has been well documented for cover crops
   such as cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), hairy, vetch (Vicia villosa
   Roth) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.). Much less is known about
   other potentially allelopathic cover crops, including certain
   brassicaceous species that are normally grown for their oilseeds,
   including canola and rapeseed (both Brassica napus L.) and mustards
   (e.g., Sinapis alba L., white and yellow mustard). Because of their
   potential contribution to pest management. there is increased interest
   in growing brassicas. both as cover crops and as seed crops harvested
   for oil production. In thiS review. we first discuss unique attributes
   of brassicas that make them promising options for pest management. as
   well as generally beneficial cover crops. Next, we review the literature
   from controlled settings on the effects of brassicas. brassica extracts
   and isolated compounds contained therein oil seed germination. seedling
   emergence and establishment. and seedling,growth-effects that. combined
   or taken alone, could contribute to reducing the density and vigor of
   weed communities in the field. Field studies examining the detrimental
   effects of brassicas in rotation with other crops. as well as examining
   the effects of brassica cover crops on weed dynamics in subsequent
   crops. also are reviewed. Finally. we review some important agronomic
   considerations about the use of brassica cover crops.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that beta-glucosidase activity can detect
   soil management effects and has potential as a soil quality indicator,
   but mechanisms for this response are not well understood. A significant
   amount of hydrolytic enzyme activity comes from extracellular (abiontic)
   activity that is bound and protected by soil colloids. This study was
   conducted to determine how management affects the kinetics of this
   enzyme (K(m), substrate affinity, and V(max), maximum reaction velocity)
   and its degree of stabilization on soil colloids. Soils were sampled
   from three sites in Oregon, with a paired comparison within each site of
   a native, unmanaged soil, and a matching soil under agricultural
   production (>50 years). Microwave radiation (MW) stress was used to
   denature the beta-glucosidase fraction associated with viable
   microorganisms in these soils as an estimate of abiontic activity. Total
   activity and V(max) were decreased by both management and MW. The
   results showed that beta-glucosidase activity is sensitive to soil
   management on a variety of soils and environments (135 vs. 190, 80 vs.
   111 and 80 vs. 134 mug PNP g(-1) h(-1) for managed and unmanaged
   treatments, respectively, at the three study sites in Oregon). The
   evidence suggests that this sensitivity to management is not (or
   minimally) due to differences in isoenzymes (K(m) generally was
   unaffected) but rather due to an overall reduction in the amount of
   enzyme present (V(max) decreased) and that this reduction in activity is
   reflected more from the activity of enzymes in the stabilized fraction
   than that associated with viable microbial population. Although
   beta-glucosidase activity after MW irradiation appears to be limited as
   a soil quality indicator, it maybe useful as research tool to separate
   abiontic from microbial activity `biomass' beta-glucosidase activity
   correlated with microbial biomass C (r = 0.42, P < 0.05) but MW
   irradiated, abiontic, activity did not (r = -0.20(NS)). (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon (SOC) estimation at the landscape level is critical
   for assessing impacts of management practices on C sequestration and
   soil quality. We determined relationships between SOC.. terrain
   attributes. field scale soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil texture
   and soil survey map units in a 9 ha coastal plain field (Aquic and Typic
   Paleudults) historically man, P aged by conventional means. The site was
   composite sampled for SOC (0-30 cm) within 18.3 X 8.5-m grids (n = 496).
   and two data sets were created from the original data. Ordinary kriging.
   co-kriging, regression kriging and multiple regression were used to
   develop SOC surfaces that were validated with an independent data set (n
   = 24) using the mean square error (MSE). The SOC was relatively low
   (26.13 Mg ha(-1)) and only moderately variable (CV = 21\%), and showed
   high spatial dependence. Interpolation techniques produced similar SOC
   maps but the best predictor was ordinary kriging (MSE = 9.11 Mg-2
   ha(-2)) while regression was the worst (MSE = 20.65 Mg-2 ha(-2)). Factor
   analysis indicated that the first three factors explained 57\% of field
   variability; compound topographic index (CTI), slope, EC and soil
   textural fractions dominated these components. Elevation, slope, CTI,
   silt content and EC explained up to 50\% of the SOC variability (P less
   than or equal to 0.01) suggesting that topography and historical erosion
   played a significant role in SOC distribution. Field subdivision into
   soil map units or k-mean clusters similarly decreased SOC variance
   (about 30\%). The study suggests that terrain attributes and EC surveys
   can be used to differentiate zones of variable SOC content. which may be
   used as bench marks to evaluate field-level impact of management
   practices on C sequestration.}},

Abstract = {{The simultaneous incorporation of heavy metals into the soil is still a
   matter of great concern. Interaction (competitive sorption) between
   these metals and the soil solid phase may result in a deterioration of
   soil quality which relies basically on amounts of alkaline cations
   saturating soils sorptive complex. Results of this study indicate that
   Pb, Cu, Cd, and Zn have induced solution pH decreases which were more
   intensive at highest metal loading rates. Partition parameters
   (K-d)-based sequences showed that Pb and Cu were more competitive than
   Cd and Zn and the overall selectivity sequence followed: Pb > Cu > Cd >
   Zn. Metal loadings and their competitive sorption have led to a
   strengthened displacement of alkaline cations (i.e. Ca2+, Mg2+, K+,
   Na+), especially of Call as a factor ``stabilizing{''} soil sorptive
   complex. Such metals impact jointly with soils acidification are of
   great environmental concern since tremendous amounts of alkaline cations
   (especially Call) may be potentially leached out, irrespective of the
   degree of soil contamination, as evidenced in the current study. High
   and positive DeltaG values implied that the studied soils were
   characterized by generally low concentrations of exchangeable potassium
   which required high energy to get displaced (desorbed). Further studies
   on heavy metal uncontaminated or contaminated areas should be undertaken
   to provide with data which should be used for predictions on changes
   related to soil buffering capacity as impacted by heavy metal inputs.}},

Abstract = {{The unsaturated soil hydraulic functions involving the soil-water
   retention curve (SWRC) and the hydraulic conductivity provide useful
   integrated indices of soil quality. Existing and newly devised methods
   were used to formulate pedotransfer functions (PTFs) that predict the
   SWRC from readily available soil data. The PTFs were calibrated using a
   large soils database from Hungary. The database contains measured
   soil-water retention data, the dry bulk density, sand, silt and clay
   percentages, and the organic matter content of 305 soil layers from some
   80 soil profiles. A three-parameter van Genuchten type function was
   fitted to the measured retention data to obtain SWRC parameters for each
   soil sample in the database. Using a quasi-random procedure, the
   database was divided into ``evaluation{''} (EVAL) and ``test{''} (TEST)
   parts containing 225 and 80 soil samples, respectively. Linear PTFs for
   the SWRC parameters were calculated for the EVAL database. The PTFs used
   for this purpose particle-size percentages, dry bulk density, organic
   matter content, and the sand/silt ratio, as well as simple transforms
   (such as logarithms and products) of these independent variables. Of the
   various independent variables, the eight most significant were used to
   calculate the different PTFs. A nonlinear (NL) predictive method was
   obtained by substituting the linear PTFs directly into the SWRC
   equation, and subsequently adjusting the PTF parameters to all retention
   data of the EVAL database. The estimation error (SSQ) and efficiency
   (EE) were used to compare the effectiveness of the linear and
   nonlinearly adjusted PTFs. We found that EE of the EVAL and the TEST
   databases increased by 4 and 7\%, respectively, using the second
   nonlinear optimization approach. To further increase EE, one measured
   retention data point was used as an additional (concomitant) variable in
   the PTFs. Using the 20 kPa water retention data point in the linear PTFs
   improved the EE by about 25\% for the TEST data set. Nonlinear
   adjustment of the concomitant variable PTF using the 20 kPa retention
   data point as concomitant variable produced the best PTF. This PTF
   produced EE values of 93 and 88\% for the EVAL and TEST soil data sets,
   respectively. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil structure is one of the main attributes of soil quality. It
   influences the soil pore system and through it all parameters of
   equations describing the transport processes in soil. Soil pore size
   distribution is either log-normal, or the log-normal distribution is an
   acceptable approximation. Kosugi {[}Water Resour. Res. 30 (1994) 89 1]
   has applied the log-normal distribution to data on the soil water
   retention curve and has replaced the empirical equation by the
   physically-based model. Log-normal pore size distributions were used for
   the estimation of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function. This
   paper deals with the application of Kosugi's model to the description of
   the retention curve and of the unsaturated conductivity function in
   soils exhibiting a bimodal distribution of pores, typical for all soil
   horizons having a certain type of structure. The domain of structural
   pores and the domain of matrix pores are defined in these structured
   soils. Results from this study show that two hydraulic functions, the
   retention curve and the unsaturated conductivity are well described by
   models based on a log-normal distribution of pores in both the
   structural and the matrix domains of the soil porous system. The
   exponents alpha, beta defined as parameters of the unsaturated
   conductivity are different for the structural and matrix domains. It is
   therefore, assumed that the configuration of soil pores including the
   tortuosity differs in these domains. The destruction of soil structure
   changes distinctly the configuration of soil pores which is demonstrated
   by the change of parameters alpha,beta Consequently, the saturated and
   unsaturated conductivity is changed, too. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{After clear-felling of a first generation Chinese fir (Cunninghamia
   lanceolata) forest, mixed stands of Chinese fir and Michelia macclurei
   (a broadleaf tree) (MCM), pure M. macclurei stands (PMS) and pure
   Chinese fir stands (PCS) were established in 1983. The effects on soil
   were evaluated 20 years after planting by measuring physicochemical,
   microbiological and biochemical parameters. Both broadleaf monoculture
   and mixtures of broadleaf and conifer exerted a favourable effect on
   soil fertility. A soil quality index (SQI) decreased in the order: PMS
   (0.62) > MCM (0.57) > PCS (0.41). Improvement in soil quality, enhanced
   biological activity and forest productivity demonstrated that mixed
   stands are an effective measure to maintain sustainable forest
   productivity, as well as to control soil degradation under successive
   stands of Chinese fir. In addition, since the microbiological and
   biochemical parameters measured were sensitive to the forest management,
   they may be potential indicators for assessing the sustainability of
   different management systems. The results also showed that total organic

Abstract = {{Studying land degradation through a soil quality approach, which reveals
   soil functioning within the ecosystem, is necessary for sustainable
   management of land resources. This investigation was conducted to
   understand the changes of soil functions, resulting from exploitive
   management, using some soil quality indicators and their statistical and
   geostatistical. measures. Undisturbed and disturbed sites were
   identified in each of two study areas, including an oak forest and a
   semiarid rangeland in central Iran. Soil organic carbon (OC), total
   nitrogen (TN), microbial respiration (MR), aggregate stability (AS), and
   hydraulic properties of the sites were determined. Statistical
   comparisons of frequency distribution functions of OC and MR revealed
   that these functions are normal in protected forest, while in the
   disturbed forest distributions deviate from normality. In the rangeland
   sites, the results were exactly the opposite. Spatial variability of the
   two variables in forest sites demonstrated pure nugget and spherical
   pattern in protected and disturbed sites, respectively. As for the
   rangeland ecosystem, pure nugget pattern was observed for both sites.
   According to our findings, protection of rangeland has resulted in
   higher OC and MR with no effect on the amount of TN and infiltration
   rate. The negative effect of this management system was a decrease in
   aggregate stability due to the formation of crust as a result of
   complete grazing exclusion. By contrast, improvement in all soil quality
   indicators in protected forest indicated the success of conservative
   management in this region. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizae are important factors of soil quality through
   their effects on host plant physiology, soil ecological interactions,
   and their contributions to maintaining soil structure. The symbiosis is
   faced with numerous challenges in agroecosystems; in order to inform
   sustainable management strategies it is hence a high priority to work
   towards mechanistic understanding of arbuscular mycorrhizae
   contributions to soil quality. This review focuses on glomalin-related
   soil protein (GRSP), operationally defined soil C pools that have been
   linked to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). In discussing this protein
   pool, we propose a new terminology used to describe fractions of soil
   proteins and glomalin. GRSP concentrations in soil are positively
   correlated with aggregate water stability. GRSP has relatively slow
   turnover in soil, contributing to lasting effects on aggregation.
   Controls on production of GRSP at the phenomenological and mechanistic
   level are evaluated. While there are significant gaps in our knowledge
   about GRSP and glomalin (particularly at the biochemical level), it is
   concluded that research on GRSP holds great promise for furthering our
   knowledge of soil structure and quality, for informing suitable
   management, and as a foundation for novel biotechnological applications
   in agriculture and beyond.}},

   red clover (Trifolium pratense), field pea (Pisum sativum), canola
   (Brassica rapa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) residues under zero and
   conventional tillage. Crop residue amounts produced in 2 trial years
   ranged from 1.6 t ha(-1) for monoculture wheat to 6.05 t ha(-1) for
   peas, and tillage had no effect. The extent of dry matter (DM)
   decomposition was usually less under zero than under conventional
   tillage, e.g., 31 to 41\% of canola DM decomposed under zero tillage
   while 41 to 50\% decomposed under conventional tillage in 12 mo.
   Corresponding percentages for other residues under zero and conventional
   tillage, respectively, were: 65 and 75\% for clover, 43 and 45 to 55\%
   for pea, and 27 and 40\% for wheat. The rate and extent of DM
   decomposition were positively correlated with N and P concentrations,
   and negatively correlated with C/N, C/P, lignin/P and lignin/K ratios.
   These decomposition patterns have implications for nutrient release and
   soil cover. Rapid decomposition is not necessarily desirable because the
   nutrients released are subject to losses in soil.}},

Abstract = {{Field experiments were conducted to correlate decomposition of red
   clover (Trifolium pratense) green manure (GM), field pea (Pisum
   sativum), canola (Brassica rapa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) residues,
   and soil organic C (SOC), under zero tillage and conventional tillage,
   with soil microbial biomass C (MBC), bacterial functional diversity and
   microbial activity (CO 2 evolution). A greenhouse experiment was also
   conducted to relate crop residue quality to soil microbial
   characteristics. Zero tillage increased MBC only in the 0- to 5-cm soil
   layer. Soil MBC decreased more with soil depth than either microbial
   diversity or total SOC. Legume GM residues induced greater initial CO2
   evolution than the other residues. This means that results that do not
   include the initial flush of microbial activity, e.g., by sampling only
   in the season(s) following residue placement, probably underestimate gas
   evolution from legume crop residues. Residue N, P and K contents were
   positively correlated with microbial functional diversity and activity,
   which were positively correlated with crop residue decomposition.
   Therefore, microbial functional diversity and activity were good
   indicators of microbial decomposition processes. Residue C/N and C/P
   ratios (i.e., high C content) were positively correlated with MBC, which
   was positively correlated with SOC. Therefore, soil MBC was a good
   indicator of soil quality (soil organic matter content).}},

Abstract = {{Heightened concerns regarding the protection of terrestrial ecosystems
   at a national level has increased the need to develop a suite of
   indicators capable of assessing the quality, integrity and fertility of
   soils. Of the assays currently available, tests that measure aspects of
   soil function and associated parameters are among the most promising,
   since these integrate effects on soil quality at the highest level of
   organisation. In this study we describe results of the deployment of an
   indicator of soil functional integrity (the bait lamina test) that is
   designed to measure the feeding activity of soil invertebrates. Bait
   lamina was used at six grassland sites located along a transect from a
   smelter at Avonmouth (South-West England) used in the EU funded BIOPRINT
   II project. Results indicated highest bait removal (feeding) at sites
   furthest from the factory, intermediate feeding activity at intervening
   sites and extremely low activities at the two sites closest to the
   smelter. The strong decline in activity for the group of sites closest
   to the smelter corresponded with increasing metal concentrations
   suggesting a clear impact of metals on detritivorous invertebrate
   feeding. Comparisons of the results of the bait lamina study to previous
   invertebrate survey work suggested that the differences in observed bait
   removal can be attributed to direct effects of metals on the abundance
   and biodiversity of key decomposer groups such as earthworms, isopods,
   molluscs, myriapods, springtails and mites.}},

Abstract = {{The Household Responsibility System initiated in the late 1970s in China
   has brought a profound change to its rural economy. The shift from the
   collective farming system to individual family farms has changed land
   management. The change, including fertilization and crop systems, may
   have significant effects on soil quality and agro-environmental
   sustainability. However, very little research is being carried out on
   the impact of reformed land tenure systems on the spatial variability of
   soil nutrients. In this study, geostatistics was applied to analyze
   changes in the spatial variability of soil organic matter and nutrients
   in paddy fields in Pinghu County, China after 20 years of land
   management change. In 1984 and 2002, 617 and 131 locations were
   selected, respectively, for collecting surface soil samples to analyze
   soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus
   (AP), and available potassium (AK). From 1984 to 2002, variabililly of
   the SOM and TN changed from strongly to moderately spatial-dependent,
   and the variability of AP remained weakly dependent on space, but that
   of the AK changed from moderately to weakly spatial-dependent. That the
   trend of the variability of four soil properties in 2002 became weaker
   than that in 1984 showed that the extrinsic factors (soil management
   practices, such as fertilization) weakened the effect by intrinsic
   factors (soil formation factors, such as soil parent materials) owing to
   a long period of land management change. The temporal geographic maps of
   the SOM and nutrients spatial distributions suggested that the
   concentrations of the SOM and nutrients had been changed to different
   extents during the period. Significant increase in AP and decrease in AK
   were noted. The changes were likely due to the imbalance between N, R
   and K fertilizers and increased grain yield.}},

Abstract = {{Adoption of conservation tillage for corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean
   (Glycine max L.) rotations, has stagnated over the past several years
   despite the evidence of the benefits to erosion control, soil health,
   and associated natural resources derived from conservation tillage. The
   Monsanto Centers of Excellence were established to evaluate the
   potential benefits of conservation tillage across a range of soils and
   climates. Our objective is to summarize the results from field-scate
   studies conducted at 13 Monsanto Centers of Excellence sites in nine
   states from 1998 through 2002. Strip-tillage, no-tillage, and
   conventional corn production, and narrow- and wide-row, no-tillage and
   conventional tillage soybean production were evaluated in this study.
   Nine of the 13 sites included a stale seedbed ``fast start{''} corn
   treatment by which the seedbed is prepared in the fall by conventional
   tillage and a spring herbicide burndown if needed. Neither soil bulk
   density nor crop emergence showed any significant differences among
   tillage systems for either crop throughout the five-year study.
   Earthworm populations were higher with no-tillage than conventional
   tillage. Soil quality indicators were not significantly different among
   the tillage systems. Soil temperature at the 5 cm depth was similar for
   strip-and conventional-tillage, with both being higher than no-tillage
   Yield differences among tillage systems within years were not
   significant for either crop, but profit for no-tillage and strip-tillage
   corn was the highest in four of five years. The five-year average profit
   for soybean was a so highest for the no-tillage, narrow-row system.
   Rotating corn and soybean using no-tillage systems resulted in \$130 to
   \$145 ha(-1) (\$53 to \$59 ac(-1)) more profit than the other practices.
   Farmers, crop consultants, and others should carefully consider overall
   profit rather than just crop yield when evaluating alternative tillage
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{The least limiting water range (LLWR) of soils has been employed as a
   methodological approach for evaluation of soil physical quality in
   different agricultural systems, including forestry, grasslands and major

   the objective of proposing and describing a simplified algorithm
   developed in Excel(R) software for quantification of the LLWR, including
   the calculation of the critical bulk density, at which the LLWR becomes
   zero. Despite the simplicity of the procedures and numerical techniques

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine interrelationships between
   functional biochemical and microbial indicators of soil quality, and
   their suitability to differentiate areas under contrasting agricultural
   management regimes. The study included five 0.8 ha areas on a sandy-loam
   soil which had received contrasting fertility and cropping regimes over
   a 5 year period. These were organically managed vegetable, vegetable
   -cereal and arable rotations, an organically managed grass clover ley,
   and a conventional cereal rotation. The organic areas had been converted
   from conventional cereal production 5 years prior to the start of the
   study. All of the biochemical analyses, including light fraction organic
   matter (LFOM) C and N, labile organic N (LON), dissolved organic N and
   water-soluble carbohydrates showed significant differences between the
   areas, although the nature of the relationships between the areas varied
   between the different parameters, and were not related to differences in
   total soil organic matter content. The clearest differences were seen in
   LFOM C and N and LON, which were higher in the organic arable area
   relative to the other areas. In the case of the biological parameters,
   there were differences between the areas for biomass-N, ATP, chitin
   content, and the ratios of ATP: biomass and basal respiration: biomass.
   For these parameters, the precise relationships between the areas
   varied. However, relative to the conventionally managed area, areas
   under organic management generally had lower biomass-N and higher ATP
   contents. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus colonization potential was
   extremely low in the conventional area relative to the organic areas.
   Further, metabolic diversity and microbial community level physiological
   profiles, determined by analysis of microbial community metabolism using
   Biolog GN plates and the activities of eight key nutrient cycling
   enzymes, grouped the organic areas together, but separated them from the
   conventional area. We conclude that microbial parameters are more
   effective and consistent indicators of management induced changes to
   soil quality than biochemical parameters, and that a variety of
   biochemical and microbial analyses should be used when considering the
   impact of management on soil quality. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Continuous monoculture systems can reduce soil organic matter because of
   low organic inputs and disturbance from tillage practices. Integrated
   cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) cropping and livestock production systems in
   West Texas may provide more sustainable alternatives to the traditional
   continuous cotton system and improve soil quality. Our study was
   conducted on a Pullman soil (Fine, mixed, thermic Torrertic Paleustolls)
   after 5 yr as a complete randomized block design (three replications)
   that compared continuous cotton and an integrated livestock-crop system
   with a perennial warm-season grass pasture (Bothriochloa bladhii)
   paddock and two paddocks (two stages) of a rotation (wheat {[}Triticum
   aestivum]-falllow-rye {[}Secale cerealel -cotton). Total N (average: 1.0
   g kg(-1) soil) remained similar among systems and soil pH was >8.1.
   Organic C was higher (13.5 g kg(-1) soil) in perennial pasture compared
   with continuous cotton (9.0 g kg(-1) soil) at 0 to 5 cm. A similar trend
   was found for the soil aggregate stability. Soil microbial biomass C
   (C-mic,) was greater in perennial pasture (193 mg kg(-1) soil) and the
   rotation under rye and cotton (237 mg kg(-1) soil) compared with
   continuous cotton (124 mg kg(-1) soil) at 0 to 5 cm, and in perennial
   pasture at 5 to 10 and 10 to 15 cm. Soil microbial biomass N (N-mic)
   showed similar trends. Soil enzyme activities were greater in perennial
   pasture and the rotation (under rye and cotton) than under continuous
   cotton at 0 to 5 cm. The integrated crop-livestock system had higher
   protozoa (20:4omega6c = 1.98\%) and fungi (18:3omega9c = 1.30\%) than
   continuous cotton (20:4omega6c = 1.09\%; 18:3omega9c = 0.76\%). These
   findings suggest positive differences in soil function and
   sustainability of the integrated croplivestock system compared with
   continuous cotton.}},

Abstract = {{Erosion rates and annual soil loss tolerance (T) values in evaluations
   of soil management practices have served as focal points for soil
   quality (SQ) research and assessment programs for decades. Our objective
   is to enhance and extend current soil assessment efforts by presenting a
   framework for assessing the impact of soil management practices on soil
   function. The tool consists of three steps: indicator selection,
   indicator interpretation, and integration into an index. The tool's
   framework design allows researchers to continually update and refine the
   interpretations for many soils, climates, and land use practices. The
   tool was demonstrated using data from case studies in Georgia, Iowa,
   California, and the Pacific Northwest (WA, ID, OR). Using an expert
   system of decision rules as an indicator selection step successfully
   identified indicators for the minimum data set (MDS) in the case study
   data sets. In the indicator interpretation step, observed indicator data
   were transformed into unitless scores based on site-specific algorithmic
   relationships to soil function. The scored data resulted in
   scientifically defensible and statistically different treatment means in
   the four case studies. The efficacy of the indicator interpretation step
   was evaluated with stepwise regressions using scored and observed
   indicators as independent variables and endpoint data as iterative
   dependent variables. Scored indicators usually had coefficients of
   determination (RI) that were similar or greater than those of the
   observed indicator values. In some cases, the R(2) values for indicators
   and endpoint regressions were higher when examined for individual
   treatments rather than the entire data set. This study demonstrates
   significant progress toward development of a SQ assessment framework for
   adaptive soil resource management or monitoring that is transferable to
   a variety of climates, soil types, and soil management systems.}},

Abstract = {{As the role of soil properties in the development of created wetlands
   (CWs) has not received adequate attention in regulatory or scientific
   communities, this study was conducted to evaluate the development of
   soil properties in 11 CWs in Virginia ranging from 4 to 16 yr since
   creation. Six of the 11 sites received at least 15 cm of topsoil (TS)
   while the other five sites received no topsoil (No TS). Cores collected
   from wet, intermediate, and dry positions at each site were analyzed for
   moisture, bulk density (D-b), soil organic matter (SOM), texture,
   water-holding capacity (WHC), P sorption index (PSI), and microbial
   biomass C (MBC). Both positions along the hydrologic gradient and
   topsoil status were hypothesized to be significant factors in explaining
   the variability of the measured soil properties. Soil moisture decreased
   significantly while Db increased significantly from wet to dry zones.
   Moisture, WHC, and PSI were all significantly elevated in certain zones
   of TS compared with No TS sites. Soil organic matter had significant
   Spearman correlations with all other measured soil properties, revealing
   that this parameter was an important indictor of soil quality. In
   addition, sites with high mean moisture, SOM, and PSI values all
   received TS; conversely, the site with the lowest mean moisture and SOM
   content did not receive TS. Thus, amending CW soils with TS appeared to
   be an effective strategy for increasing soil moisture, WHC, and PSI.
   Whenever possible, practices such as TS or organic amendments should be
   employed, especially if wetland creation involves excavation into
   subsoils with low SOM and high D-b.}},

Abstract = {{Climate, specifically moisture and temperature, influences plant growth
   and nutrient cycling; thus, climate also influences prairie development.
   Relatively little research has been conducted in the ecological
   transition zone between the Great Plains and the more humid forests.
   Since moisture and temperature affect many ecosystem processes, the
   wetter climate of the southern forest region should influence soil
   biogeochemical cycling quite differently from that in grassland soils.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate soil quality and the
   relationships between selected soil properties across a climosequence in
   a transition zone between tallgrass prairie in humid-temperate (Ozark
   Highlands) and humid-subtropical (Grand Prairie) climate regimes in
   Arkansas. Soil physical, chemical and biological properties of the upper
   10 cm differed significantly between physiographic regions. Linear
   relationships between total soil nitrogen (N) and carbon (C),
   extractable phosphorus and manganese, electrical conductivity and soil
   organic matter concentration differed significantly between
   physiographic regions. Total soil N and C decreased with increasing soil
   bulk density in both physiographic regions. The relationship between
   total C and bulk density differed by physiographic region, while the
   relationship between total N and bulk density did not. Soil organic
   matter concentration, C:N ratio, and many extractable nutrients, were
   higher and relationships between selected soil properties differed under
   native tallgrass prairie in a relatively warm and wet climate than that
   in a relatively cooler and drier climate. The results of this study
   suggest that prairie preservation, restoration and management practices
   should differ depending on climate regimes.}},

Title = {{Leaf litter breakdown in natural and plantation forests of the Lama

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{The Lama forest reserve in southern Benin, West Africa, comprises timber
   and fuelwood plantations as well as some of the country's last vestiges
   of semi-deciduous lowland forest. The reserve is intended to protect the
   fauna and flora and to promote the sustainable use of tree plantations.
   An important aspect in its management is the preservation of soil
   quality, which in turn is related to key ecosystem processes such as
   decomposition. In the present study, we examined the breakdown of leaf
   litter from two indigenous species Afzelial is africana (A. africana)
   and Ceiba pentandra (C. pentandra), and two exotic tree species Tectona
   grandis (T grandis) and Senna siatnea (S. siamea), using the litterbag
   technique (1920 litterbags altogether). We also studied the relationship
   between litter breakdown and the relative abundance (frequency of
   occurrence) of litter-dwelling invertebrates. The study was conducted
   over a 140-day period, focusing on four different forest types:
   semi-deciduous natural forest, young teak, old teak and fuelwood (mainly
   S. siatnea) plantations. Both main factors, litter species and forest
   type, had a significant effect on litter breakdown. The residual litter
   weight was lowest in A. africana, intermediate in S. siatnea and C.
   pentandra and highest in T. grandis. Differences were significant for
   all but one pairwise comparison (A. africana versus S. siamea). With
   regard to forest type, the breakdown was highest in natural forest,
   followed by young teak, old teak and firewood plantations. Except for
   teak plantations (young versus old teak), all comparisons were
   significant. We also found a significant litter x forest interaction,
   indicating dissimilar changes in litter breakdown across forest types.
   With the exception of teak, decay rate coefficients (k) were higher than
   in most tropical forests, ranging from k = 1.3 (T grandis in firewood
   plantations) to k = 4.7 (A. africana in natural forest). The frequency
   of occurrence of invertebrates differed among leaf litters and forests.
   while there was no significant litter x forest interaction. Higher
   frequencies were observed in indigenous than in exotic litter. Likewise,
   litterbags in natural forest attracted more invertebrates than those in
   forest plantations. We found a significant inverse linear relationship
   between invertebrate frequency and residual litter weight, indicating
   that the breakdown of litter was strongly related to the activity of
   invertebrates. Our study concludes that management practices should aim
   to enhance decomposer communities to safeguard the productivity and
   sustainable use of Lama forest. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Commercial forest plantations have increased during the last decade in
   Uruguay in soils of low cropping capability. Eucalyptus grandis (Hill ex
   Maiden) has been the main species planted due to its fast growth and
   adaptability to climate fluctuations. Assuming that the conversion from
   natural grazed pastures to commercial Eucalyptus plantations generates
   significant changes in the soil biological properties, we compared
   microbial enumeration and variables directly related to microbial
   activity to characterize these changes, as well as to determine the
   extent to which these soil biological properties change seasonally and
   with soil depth. The soil use conversion from pasture to forest land did
   not have a significant effect on the number of cellulolytic aerobes,
   P-solubilizers and Azotobacter spp. communities. Soil respiration, the
   C-mineralization coefficient, dehydrogenase, fluorescein diacetate
   hydrolysis and acid and alkaline phosphatase activities were affected
   significantly. Microbial enumeration of cellulolytics, P-solubilizers
   and Azotobacter spp., and parameters related to microbial biomass, soil
   respiration and the C-mineralization coefficient showed marked effects
   of sampling season. This, however, was not the case for the relative
   levels of the enzyme activities evaluated. These results indicated that
   the enzyme activities evaluated were sensitive and reliable indicators
   of the biochenucal changes generated by the soil use change. Spring
   appeared to be a better time for sampling than summer or winter because
   enzyme activities tended to be higher. Soil sampling depth was shown to
   be an important factor for obtaining consistent results, especially for
   the measurement of enzyme activities. For the last indicators, as well
   as the others, better results were obtained sampling and analyzing the
   upper 10 cm of the mineral soil profile. Our work suggested that
   microbial biomass, soil respiration, and enzyme activities are useful
   tools to assess biological soil quality changes due to the conversion of
   pasture land to planted E. grandis forest. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All

Abstract = {{Uniform topsoil replacement depths on coal mine reclaimed areas have
   been mandated by USA federal and state regulations; however, soils of
   the premine landscape are not naturally uniform in depth and vary in
   physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. In addition, uniform
   topsoil depths may actually hinder the development of diverse reclaimed
   plant communities. We studied the effect of varying topsoil replacement
   depth treatments (15, 30, and 56 cm) on soil and backfill pH,
   electrolytic conductivity (EC), and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) within
   a reclaimed coal mine study area. Backfill material (also known as
   spoil) at this site did not possess levels of pH, EC, and SAR that were
   detrimental to plant growth. There was only a slight reduction in pH,
   EC, and SAR within the upper 15 cm depth in the reclaimed topsoil
   treatments with a general increase of EC and SAR in the lower portion of
   the replaced soil pro. le. Some downward movement of soluble salts
   within the reclaimed treatments was evident despite low precipitation.
   For examples, SAR in the 0-15 cm depth over all reclaimed treatments was
   lower in 2002 than 2000-2001, and the 0-30 cm portion of the reclaimed
   soil profile had reduced pH and EC, while the 30-60 cm portion had
   increased EC and SAR. It is anticipated that soil quality differences in
   terms of pH, EC, and SAR between topsoil depth treatments will be
   enhanced with time. Comparison of the reclaimed area to the native
   reference areas suggested numerous depth differences as a result of
   homogeneity of the replaced topsoil vs. undisturbed soil profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural practices that reduce soil degradation and improve
   agricultural sustainability are needed particularly for
   tropical/subtropical soils. No-tillage planting causes minimal soil
   disturbance and combined with crop rotation may hold potential to meet
   these goals. Soil enzyme activities can provide information on how soil
   management is affecting the potential to perform the processes in soils
   such as decomposition and nutrient cycling. Soil enzyme activities were
   investigated in a split-plot experiment (3 replications) where tillage
   (no till and conventional) was the main plot and crop rotation
   (soybean/wheat, S/W; maize/wheat, M/ W or cotton/wheat, C/W) was the
   subplot. The experiment was established in 1976 in southern Brazil. Soil
   samples were taken at 0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm depths in 1997 and 1998.
   The 0-5 cm layer under NT system showed increases up 68\% for amylase,
   90\% for cellulase, 219\% for arylsulfatase, 46\% for acid phosphatase,
   and 61\% for alkaline phosphatase. There were significant correlations
   of soil enzyme activities with total organic C, and C and N microbial
   biomass. These results showed that NT increased microbial activity and
   that soil enzyme activity is a sensitive indicator of alteration soil
   quality by management.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was carried out to adjudge the soil quality of two
   sites at the defence establishments in India. Various soil samples were
   collected from the surface and up to 20 cm depth (subsurface) as per
   apportioned gridding method. These samples were subjected to air drying
   for 15 days and were characterised for various parameters. The soil is
   clayey and loamy with granular blocky structure on both the sites. The
   pH ranged from 7.1 to 7.7 +/- 0.1 for site I and from 5.5 to 8.0 +/- 0.1
   for site II; salinity and bulk density ranged from 0.1 per cent to 8 per
   cent and from 1.2 g/cm(3) to 1.5 g/cm(3), respectively and soil moisture
   was about 0.4 +/- 1 per cent for both the sites. Similarly, total
   Kjeldahl nitrogen ranged from 1100 mg kg(-1) to 1900 mg kg(-1) for site
   I and 1700 mg kg(-1) to 9000 mg kg(-1) for site II and total organic
   carbon ranged from 18 mg g(-1) to 75 mg g(-1) for both the sites.
   A good correlation between nitrate concentration and various explosive
   process activities has been observed which gives substantial evidence in
   terms of contamination of the soil. High performance liquid
   chromatography analysis, which shows varied concentrations of RDX-HMX,
   NB, DNB, DNT, and TNT in the respective ranges 0.003-2.300 mg g(-1),
   0.002-0.350 mg g(-1), 0.002-0.550 mg g(-1), 0.004-0.041 mg g(-1) and
   0.010-0.050 mg g(-1) for site I and 0.002-0.013 mg g(-1), 0.005-0.350 mg
   g(-1), 0.003-0.080 mg g(-1), 0.001-0.100 mg g(-1), 0.0001-0.044 mg g(-1)

Abstract = {{Cover crops combined with conservation tillage practices can minimize
   chemical inputs and improve soil quality, soil water-holding capacity,
   weed suppression and crop yields. No-tillage production of sweet corn
   (Zea mays var. `Silver Queen') was studied for 2 years at the USDA
   Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Md., to determine cover crop
   management practices that maximize yield and suppress weeds. Cover crop
   treatments were hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), rye (Secale cereale
   L.) and hairy vetch mixture, and bare soil (no cover crop). There were
   three cover crop killing methods: mowing, rolling or contact herbicide
   paraquat. All plots were treated with or without atrazine and
   metolachlor after planting. There was a 23\% reduction in sweet corn
   plant population in the rye-hairy vetch mixture compared to bare soil.
   Averaged over both years, sweet corn yield in hairy vetch treatments was
   43\% greater than in bare soil, whereas yield in the rye-hairy vetch
   mixture was 30\% greater than in bare soil. There were no significant
   main effects of kill method or significant interactions between kill
   method and cover crop on yield. Sweet corn yields were not different for
   hairy vetch or rye-hairy vetch treatments with or without atrazine and
   metolachlor. However, yield in bare soil without the herbicides atrazine
   and metolachor were reduced by 63\% compared to bare soil with these
   herbicides. When no atrazine and metolachlor were applied, weed biomass
   was reduced in cover crops compared to the bare soil. Regression
   analysis showed greater yield loss per unit of weed biomass for bare
   soil than for the vetch or rye-hairy vetch mixture. This analysis
   suggests that cover crops increased sweet corn yield in the absence of
   atrazine and metolachlor not only by reducing weed biomass, but also by
   increasing the competitiveness of corn to weeds at any given biomass.}},

Abstract = {{The observed and projected increase in emission of greenhouse gases,
   with attendant effects on global warming and sea level rise, have raised
   interests in identifying mitigation options. Terrestrial C sequestration
   involves capture of atmospheric C through photosynthesis and storage in
   biota, soil and wetlands. Land use, vegetation and soil management have
   a strong impact on the biotic processes of C sequestration. Losses of C
   from the terrestrial ecosystems are exacerbated by deforestation,
   biomass burning, plowing, resource-based and subsistence agriculture,
   and practices that mine soil fertility and deplete the soil organic C
   (SOC) pool. Biomass burning may also produce charcoal, which is an inert
   carbon with long residence time. Practices that enhance C sequestration
   include afforestation and reforestation, conservation tillage and mulch
   farming, integrated nutrient management and adopting systems with high
   biodiversity. Net C sequestration within an ecosystem can be assessed by
   taking into account the hidden C costs of fertilizers, pesticides,
   tillage, irrigation and other input. Restoration of degraded soils and
   ecosystems has a vast potential of C sequestration. The Kyoto Protocol
   provides for C sequestration in terrestrial sinks and C trading through
   Clean Development Mechanisms. Terrestrial C sequestration, besides being
   a win-win strategy, offers a window of opportunity for the first few
   decades of the 21(st) century. It is a natural process of reducing the
   rates of gaseous emissions while alternatives to fossil fuel take
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{This study focused on the potential of using soil enzyme activities and
   general microbiological rates (respiration, N-mineralisation,
   nitrification) to evaluate the quality of soils affected by a pyrite mud
   spill which contained high concentrations of heavy metals. The quality
   of soils after restoration was estimated by comparing enzyme activities
   and general microbiological rates in three different types of
   experimental field plots: (i) non-polluted, (ii) polluted but restored,
   and (iii) polluted but un-restored soils. Non-polluted soils showed the
   highest levels of enzyme activity. Significant differences were detected
   for acid phosphatase, beta-glucosidase and urease activities between all
   types of plots. However, arylsulfatase and alkaline phosphatase
   activities showed no significant differences between the restored plots
   and polluted but un-restored plots. Geometric mean statistics were used
   as an index of soil quality in terms of overall: (i) bioavailable heavy
   metal concentrations, (ii) assayed enzyme activities, and (iii) general
   microbiological rates, in order to compare plots differing in the degree
   of pyritic mud pollution. The results indicate that it is important to
   consider these three criteria in to estimate the soil quality of
   heavy-metal contaminated soils. Typically, enzyme activities were
   negatively correlated with bioavailable Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations,
   but positively with soil pH values. In contrast, pH values were
   negatively correlated with bioavailable concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn.
   It is unclear if the generalised lower enzyme activities found in
   restored soils, compared to non-polluted soils, is promoted by pH or
   bioavailable heavy metals concentrations, or a combination of both. (C)

Abstract = {{Many external effects of land use change are based on modifications of
   lateral flows of soil, water, air, fire or organisms. Lateral flows can
   be intercepted by filters and thus the severity and spatial range. of
   external effects of land use change is under the influence of filter
   effects. Wherever lateral flows are involved, research results cannot be
   simply scaled on an area basis, and overall impact does not follow
   simple linear causal relationships. This complexity has consequences for
   relationships amongst the primary agents who initiate or exacerbate
   external effects, other stakeholders who are affected by them and
   policymakers who attempt to mitigate problems that reach sufficient
   visibility in society. In this paper we review how the relative
   importance of lateral flows and filter effects differs among a number of
   externalities, and the implications this has for research methods. If
   flows and filters are incompletely understood, policies may be based on
   fallacies. Whereas `fire-breaks' act as filters in the lateral flow of
   the high temperature pulse of a fire, smoke from land-based fires can be
   intercepted only by rainfall acting as a filter and the external impact
   of smoke is determined by the atmospheric conditions governing lateral
   flow and chemical transformations along the pathway. Causal relations in
   smoke and haze problems are relatively simple and may form a basis for
   designing policy interventions to reduce downwind damage. For
   biodiversity issues, landscape connectivity, the absence of filters
   restricting dispersal and movement of organisms, is increasingly
   recognised as an influence on the dynamics of species richness and its
   scaling relations. Biodiversity research methods can extend beyond the
   current descriptive stage into clarifying causal relations with a
   lateral flow perspective. The question whether connectivity is in fact
   desired, however, depends on stakeholder interests and situation. Forest
   functions in watershed protection, presumably leading to a continuous
   flow of clean water in the dry season through the subsoil instead of a
   rapid surface transfer, have been generally attributed to the trees
   rather than the forest, with its rough surface structure, swamps and
   infiltration sites. A new synthesis of site-specific hydrological
   knowledge and tree water balance studies may be needed to separate myth
   from reality, and avoid wasting public funds on tree planting under the
   heading, of reforestation, without restoring the hydrological regime of
   a real forest. Soil movement can be intercepted at a C 9 41 range of
   scales and in as far as soil transport entails movement of soil
   fertility, filter zones can be very productive elements of a landscape.
   To achieve `integrated natural resource management' all external effects
   of land use will somehow have to be taken into account in farmer
   decision making about the use of natural resources on and off farm'.
   Farmers ecological knowledge may include concepts of lateral flows and
   should be further explored as an integral part of a new landscape
   ecological approach. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid establishment of herbaceous cover after ski run construction is
   fundamental to limit soil erosion and restore initial ecosystem
   functioning. This paper reports the disturbance and development of
   relationships between soil physico-chemical properties and microbial
   activities following ski run construction and along a chronosequence of
   restored alpine grasslands (1 month and 1, 4 and 13 years). Several
   measurements were made on vegetation (species composition, root
   biomass), soil (aggregate stability, particle size distribution, total
   carbon and nitrogen content, porosity) and soil microbial activity
   (heterotrophic microbial diversity and functional structure, nitrogenase
   activity). During the restoration chronosequence, effective porosity was
   found to be positively correlated with rock fragments (>2 mm) proportion
   (r = 0.96; P<0.05) while capillary porosity was positively correlated
   with clay content (r = 0.86; P<0.05). A specific microbial pattern of
   native alpine soil was evident with low non-symbiotic N2-fixation (6.61
   E-11 mol C2H4 per gram), low heterotrophic functional diversity and low
   metabolic quotient (qCO(2)). The increase in potential nitrogen fixation
   along the chronosequence was attributed to labile C input by root
   exudation and favourable soil moisture. High catabolic diversity in
   older restored soils (4 and 13 years old) was also sustained by the
   constant evolution of soil physico-chemical properties, especially
   heterogeneous C resource input. In accordance with the positive
   relationship between catabolic evenness and ecosystem function, our data
   suggests that the microbial community remained very unstable during the
   early stage of ski run restoration (<13 years old) because of the
   dominance of opportunist micro-organisms. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of applications of traditionally composted
   farmyard manure (FYM) and two types of biodynamically composted FYM over
   9 years on soil chemical properties, microbial biomass and respiration,
   dehydrogenase and saccharase activities, decomposition rates and root
   production under grass-clover, activity and biomass of earthworms under
   wheat, and yields in a grass-clover, potatoes, winter wheat, field
   beans, spring wheat, winter rye crop rotation. The experiment was
   conducted near Bonn, on a Fluvisol using a randomised complete block
   design (n=6). Our results showed that plots which received either
   prepared or non-prepared FYM (30 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) had significantly
   increased soil pH, P and K concentrations, microbial biomass,
   dehydrogenase activity, decomposition (cotton strips), earthworm cast
   production and altered earthworm community composition than plots
   without FYM application. Application of FYM did not affect the soil C/N
   ratio, root length density, saccharase activity, microbial basal
   respiration, metabolic quotient and crop yields. The biodynamic
   preparation of FYM with fermented residues of six plant species (6 g
   Mg-1 FYM) significantly decreased soil microbial basal respiration and
   metabolic quotient compared to non-prepared FYM or FYM prepared with
   only Achillea. The biodynamic preparation did not affect soil microbial
   biomass, dehydrogenase activity and decomposition during 62 days.
   However, after 100 days, decomposition was significantly faster in plots
   which received completely prepared FYM than in plots which received no
   FYM, FYM without preparations or FYM with the Achillea preparation.
   Furthermore, the application of completely prepared FYM led to
   significantly higher biomass and abundance of endogeic or anecic
   earthworms than in plots where non-prepared FYM was applied.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to verify the alterations in the amounts
   and storage of organic carbon in agricultural-forestry-pasture, planted
   pasture and eucalyptus reforestation systems in the northwestern part of
   the Minas Gerais State. The studied soil was a typical dystrophic Red
   Latosol. The soil samplings were performed in three replicates at the
   depths of 0-5, 5-20 and 20-40 cm. The systems were selected according to
   the historical use, namely, native cerrado (referential), eucalyptus +
   rice (year zero of the agricultural-forestry-pasture system), eucalyptus
   + soybeans (year one of the agricultural-forestry-pasture system);
   eucalyptus + pasture (year two of the agricultural-forestry-pasture
   system), eucalyptus + pasture + cattle raising (year three of the
   agricultural-forestry-pasture system), conventional pasture and
   conventional eucalyptus. There was significant difference in the amounts
   and stock of carbon of the evaluated systems in relation to the native
   cerrado. In general, the systems are functioning as C-CO(2) emitter when
   compared with the native cerrado, where the various tillage operations
   are accelerating the oxidation process and loss of organic carbon. It
   was observed a trend of increment of the carbon stock as time goes by in
   the agricultural-forestry-pasture systems, demonstrating the efficiency
   of this system in maintaining or even increasing the organic carbon
   stock along the years. Index terms: Soil quality, carbon stock,
   agricultural-forestry-pasture system, cerrado.}},

Abstract = {{Poultry litter is an organic amendment that has been used successfully
   as an alternative nutrient source to inorganic, commercial fertilizers.
   Poultry litter also has the potential to improve other aspects of soil
   quality. However, few field studies have been conducted to ascertain the
   effects of poultry litter on soil physical properties. The objectives of
   this study were to evaluate the short-term effects of poultry litter
   form (i.e., fresh vs. pelletized) and rate on soil bulk density and
   water content and early-season stand development in three fine-textured
   soils of the Mississippi River Delta region of eastern Arkansas that are
   commonly cropped to rice (Oryza sativa L.). Six litter rates were used
   representing a range of total,nitrogen (N) rates. Soil samples were
   collected from the 0- to 10-cm depth between four and six weeks after
   litter application and incorporation for bulk density and volumetric
   water content determination. Leaf area index was measured as an
   indicator of early-season stand development. Litter form did not affect
   soil bulk density, water content, or leaf area index in two silt loams,
   and a silty-clay soil. In contrast, soil bulk density decreased
   significantly (p < 0.01) as litter rate increased and leaf area index
   decreased as bulk density increased in one silt-loam soil, but was
   unaffected by litter rate in the other silt-loam and silty-clay soil.
   Litter rate generally did not affect soil volumetric water content, but
   results indicate that the effects of litter rate may be manifested more
   at relatively low soil water contents. The results of this study
   demonstrate that poultry litter has positive short-term effects on
   physical properties of fine-textured soils. These results are
   agronomically significant for many crops in terms of the potential for
   creating a less compacted, seedbed for seedling emergence, improved
   stand development, and ultimately increased crop yields.}},

Abstract = {{An agent-based model was developed as a tool designed to explore our
   understanding of spatial, social, and environmental issues related to
   land-use/cover change. The model focuses on a study site in a region of
   the Amazon frontier, characterized by the development of family farms on
   100-ha lots arranged along the Transamazon highway and a series of side
   roads, west of Altamira, Brazil. The model simulates the land-use
   behaviour of farming households on the basis of a heuristic
   decisionmaking strategy that utilizes burn quality, subsistence
   requirements, household characteristics, and soil quality as key factors
   in the decisionmaking process. Farming households interact through a
   local labour pool. The effects of the land-use decisions made by
   households affect the land cover of their plots and ultimately that of
   the region. This paper describes this model, referred to as LUCITA, and
   presents preliminary results showing land-cover changes that compare
   well with observed land-use and land-cover changes in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Increased poultry production has contributed to excess nutrient problems
   in Atlantic Coastal Plain soils due to land application of poultry
   litter (PL). Aluminum sulfate {[}alum, Al-2(SO4)(3)(.)14H(2)O] amendment
   of PL effectively reduces soluble phosphorus (P) in the PL; however, the
   effects of these litters when added to acidic, sandy soils are not well
   understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy
   of alum-amended poultry litter in reducing P release from three Delaware
   Coastal Plain soils: Evesboro loamy sand (Ev; excessively drained,
   mesic, coated Typic Quartzipsamments), Rumford loamy sand (Ru; well
   drained, coarse-loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic Typic Hapludults),
   and Pocomoke sandy loam (Pm; very poorly drained, coarse-loamy,
   siliceous, active, thermic Typic Umbraquults). Long-term (25 d) and
   short-term (24 h) desorption studies were conducted, in addition to
   chemical extractions and kinetic modeling, to observe the changes that
   alum-amended versus unamended PL caused in the soils. The Ev, Ru, and
   Put soils were incubated with 9 Mg ha(-1) of alum-amended or unamended
   PL. Long-term desorption (25 d) of the incubated material resulted in
   approximately 13.5\% (Ev), 12.7\% (Ru), and 13.3\% (Pm) reductions in
   cumulative P desorbed when comparing soil treated with unamended and
   alum-amended PL. In addition, the P release from the soil treated with
   alum-amended litter was not significantly different from the control
   (soil alone). Short-term desorption (24 h) showed 7.3\% (Ev), 15.4\%
   (Ru), and 20\% (Pm) reductions. The overall implication from this study
   is that the use of alum as a PL amendment is useful in coarse-textured
   soils of the Coastal Plain. With increased application of alum-amended
   PL, more significant decreases may be possible with little or no effect
   on soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{The Refuge Improvement Act of 1997 established a statutory mission and
   management standards for the National Wildlife Refuge system. The U.S.
   Fish and Wildlife Service subsequently issued a policy for ensuring the
   biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health of the system.
   This policy requires understanding the management objectives of each
   refuge in a local, regional, and national context. An assessment of the
   refuge system in a national and regional context reveals that refuges
   are typically smaller than many conservation holdings and are unevenly
   distributed across the conterminous U.S. Western rangelands, coastal
   wetlands, and northern grasslands; wetlands are the best-represented
   ecosystems, while temperate forests have the poorest representation. In
   contrast to other agency holdings or management designations in the
   national protected areas network (e.g., national parks, national
   forests, wilderness areas), refuges tend to occupy sites at lower
   elevations and that have higher productivity and soil quality. This
   difference points to the important contribution of the refuges in
   providing much needed ecological balance within the national protected
   areas network. However, the ecological integrity of the refuge system is
   challenged by the proximity of individual refuges to development.
   Overall, the refuges are becoming islands in a landscape matrix of urban
   and agricultural development. This creates future challenges for meeting
   management objectives to ensure the biological integrity, diversity, and
   environmental health of the system. If the policy to ensure biological
   integrity, diversity, and environmental health of the refuge system is
   to be successful, it may be more important to address issues about what
   happens on adjacent lands than uses within refuges.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted in Florida in 1999 and 2000 to examine the
   impact of alternative crop production practices on soil quality and
   yields of fresh market pepper (Capsicum annuum). Replicated field plots
   were established on an organic vegetable farm that had been under
   certification for 5 years and on a conventional pepper farm that had
   been fumigated with methyl bromide for 25 consecutive years. Production
   practices evaluated included raised beds covered by white plastic mulch,
   soil solarization, no-till in a stubble crop of sunn hemp
   (Crotolariajuncea) or iron-clay pea (Vigna unguiculata) and the addition
   of 67 t ha(-1) of urban plant debris (UPD). Soil fumigation with methyl
   bromide-chloropicrin was also evaluated at the conventional farm site.
   Soil organic carbon significantly increased following the addition of
   UPI) in both years at the organic site but only in the second year at
   the conventional site. Cation exchange capacity increased significantly
   after addition of UPI) in both years at both sites and a significant
   interaction with production practices was observed in the second year at
   the organic site. Soil phosphorus levels were high at both sites but
   were not impacted by production practices or UPD. In 1999, the addition
   of UPI) significantly decreased soil nitrate levels at the organic site
   and the conventional site, except under the no-till treatments. In 2000,
   soil nitrate levels were not affected by UPI) or production practice.
   Stand counts, determined by the number of surviving pepper plants 21-28
   days after transplanting, were severely impacted in no-till treatments
   due to intense competition from weeds. Marketable yields equal to, or
   above, the 1999/2000 statewide average for conventional production
   systems were obtained with soil fumigation and soil solarization at the
   conventional site in 1999. In 2000, an epidemic of Phytophthora blight
   (Phytophthora capsici) eliminated production at the conventional site.
   Marketable yield at the organic site approached the statewide average
   for conventional systems under the solarization treatment. Yields under
   plastic mulch were increased at both sites with the addition of UPD. The
   results demonstrated that organic pepper yields from soil-solarized
   plots were similar to yields obtained by conventional farmers using high
   inputs of rapidly mobile nitrogen sources. However, no-till systems for
   fall production do not appear to be a viable alternative under Florida
   conditions due to the rapid proliferation of weeds under the cover crop
   stubble. The addition of urban plant debris was associated with an
   increase in soil organic carbon and cation exchange capacity in sandy
   soils typical of those found in Florida.}},

   from 0 to 600 kg N ha(-1) were made at annual and 5-yr intervals over a
   6-yr period. Nitrogen fertilization increased N mineralization potential
   in these soils. However, soil N mineralization followed a quadratic
   relationship with the total amount of N applied in fertilizer over the
   6-yr treatment period, increasing up to total application rates of 450
   kg N ha(-1) and then declining at higher rates. The decrease in N
   mineralization rates at the high N fertilization rates may be due to
   changes in the quality of soil organic matter, which reduced the
   effectiveness of extracellular enzymes and decreases the rate of
   decomposition and mineralization. Soil pH dropped following urea
   fertilization, with greater declines observed in the highest rates of
   urea fertilizer. Decreases in extractable Ca and Mg levels in the soil
   accompanied the decline in soil pH. These results suggest that high
   rates of nitrification occurred and that nitrate leaching was stripping
   Ca and Mg from the cation-exchange complex in these soils. It appears
   that repeated applications of urea fertilizer at low to intermediate
   rates may increase long-term N availability and thus improve soil
   quality. However, annual applications of high rates of urea may decrease
   soil quality because under these circumstances N mineralization did not
   increase and there was a loss of cations from the soil.}},

Abstract = {{Intensification of crop rotation and increasing use of machinery with
   high wheel loads are clearly related to compaction of the subsoil.
   Subsoil compaction is persistent and the effect of natural and
   artificial loosening has been disappointing. Therefore, prevention of
   subsoil compaction is the best way to preserve the structure and quality
   of the subsoil. In addition to field studies, there is an increasing
   need for analytical tools to develop and evaluate measures for
   preventing subsoil compaction. The objective of the research was to
   develop such a tool in the form of a computer model suitable for
   educators and extension workers, professional advisers, agricultural
   engineers and scientists. The analytical soil compaction model (SOCOMO)
   was developed to calculate soil stresses under wheel loads. In specific
   cases, the calculated stresses are compared with soil strengths measured
   in the laboratory. The calculated stresses were compared with known soil
   strengths or soil strengths determined with the help of pedotransfer
   functions. Subsoil compaction and deformation are prevented if the
   stresses exerted remain smaller than the actual strength of the subsoil.
   To test the model, traffic experiments were performed and methods
   developed to measure stress, compaction and deformation in the subsoil
   caused by wheel load. The test was successful and the model has been
   used to compare stresses under normal and low-pressure tires, as well as
   tinder tandem and dual-wheel configurations. SOCOMO was also used to
   construct a wheel-load carrying-capacity map of The Netherlands. The
   model is easy to use and requires only minimal input. However, it is not
   yet as user-friendly as it could be. Weak points of the model are that
   the rut depth must be estimated and that the shape of the pressure
   distribution exerted by the tire on the bottom of the rut is based on
   rules of thumb. Re use of the concept that subsoil compaction can be
   prevented by keeping the exerted stresses on the subsoil below actual
   strength is frustrated by the fact that data and pedotransfer functions
   of soil strength are scarce. More measurements and development of
   pedotransfer functions are required. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of red deer grazing and fence-line pacing on soil
   losses of contaminants (suspended sediment, Escherichia coli,
   phosphorus) and nitrogen species (ammonia, nitrate) via overland flow
   and soil physical properties (macroporosity, bulk density, saturated
   hydraulic conductivity, K-sat) soon after (1 day) and 6 weeks after
   grazing on a Pallic pastoral soil in southern New Zealand. Fence-line
   pacing decreased the soil volume occupied by water, macroporosity and
   K-sat, while increasing suspended sediment (to 0.226 g 100 mL(-1)),
   total P (to 2.0 mg L-1), mainly as particulate P (up to 90\% of total
   P), and E. coli (to 3.52 log(10) c.f.u. 100 mL(-1)) concentrations in
   overland flow at 1 day after grazing compared with soils from the rest
   of the paddock (0.148 g 100 mL(-1), 0.86 mg L-1 and 2.86 log(10) c.f.u.
   100 mL(-1), respectively). Although concentrations in overland flow were
   less at 6 weeks after grazing than at 1 day after grazing, losses of P,
   especially in fence-line soils, were still above recommended limits for
   surface water quality. Compared to P, losses of N species would be
   unlikely to have a significant impact on downstream water quality.
   Management strategies should be directed towards minimizing the
   occurrence of fence-line pacing to prevent contaminant loss and maintain
   water and soil quality.}},

   secondary source of contaminants to the environment. Total soil
   concentration data are required to evaluate soil quality and the ability
   of soils to support life, however to determine the source and dispersion
   of contaminants and an accurate depiction of spatial distributions,
   normalised data are required. The effectiveness and economics of three
   normalisation methods for soils are tested in the current study. Size
   normalisation undertaken by physical separation of the fine fraction
   (<62.5 \&mu;m) provides consistent spatial information, but is time
   consuming and expensive and does not capture anthropogenic contributions
   associated with the coarse fraction of the soil, which is not generally
   analysed. Elemental normalisation only utilises a single analysis of the
   total soil, but requires that the normalising element acts
   conservatively, and as a proxy for the fine fraction, which are
   requirements not always met. A new post-extraction normalising procedure
   ( PEN) also requires an analysis of the total soil only, but is not
   dependent on a normalising element and can be used to normalise any type
   of contaminant. In this approach, the residue after acid digestion is
   assumed to be the major diluent controlling the confounding effects of
   variable grain size. A strong relationship between the residue mass and
   soil size supports the use of this residue material as a normalising
   agent. Results indicate that the PEN method is equally efficient at
   reducing the confounding effects of variable grain size as elemental
   normalisation, but that size normalisation produces the most consistent
   spatial information and should be used in detailed studies of source and
   dispersion.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation was carried out to assess the potential suitability
   of certain Australian plants for use in the phytoremediation of derelict
   mine sites. The plant species studied were native to the area
   surrounding a silver mine at Yerranderie in NSW, Australia, which has
   been derelict now for over 70 years. The contamination on this site is
   typical of that caused by acid mine drainage, with very low soil and
   water pH, and large areas devoid of topsoil and vegetation. Soil metal
   concentrations exceeded the Australian and New Zealand Environment and
   Conservation Council (ANZECC) 1992 guidelines for soil quality in
   several locations. Corresponding topsoil and upper plant samples were
   collected along three transects crossing the path of drainage from the
   mine wastes. Six plant species were dominant on the site, including
   Juncus usitatus (common rush), Lomandra longifolia (spiny-headed mat
   rush), Cynodon dactylon (couch), Pteridium esculentum (bracken fern),
   Acacia decurrens (black wattle) and Melaleuca alternifolia (teatree). Of
   these species, C. dactylon, J. usitatus and L. longifolia were
   identified as of potential use in phytostabilisation programs, due to
   tolerance of acid soils and tolerance and/or accumulation of
   significantly higher concentrations of Pb and Cd than other plant
   species present on the site.}},

Abstract = {{In intensive vegetable production, low organic matter (OM) inputs and
   leaching of nitrate (NO3--N) decrease soil quality with time. Four
   management regimes were compared for their effects on soils and on
   production issues in a cooperative research project with a commercial
   vegetable grower in the Salinas Valley, California, USA, on an 8.3 ha
   field: minimum tillage with OM (+OM) inputs; minimum tillage with no OM
   (-OM) inputs; conventional tillage +OM inputs; and conventional tillage
   -OM inputs. Minimum tillage retained the same raised beds for the 2-year
   study (four crop cycles), and filled to approximately 20 ern depth.
   Conventional tillage used many passes for surface and subsoil tillage,
   and disturbed the soil to approximately 50 cut depth. In +OM, compost
   was added two times per year, with a rye (Secale cereale) cover crop in
   the fall or winter, whereas -OM treatments followed the typical practice
   of only incorporating crop residues. Addition of cover crops and compost
   increased microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), reduced bulk density,
   and decreased the NO3--N pools in the 0-90 cm profile, so that leaching
   potential was lower compared to -OM treatments. Tillage practices had
   generally similar effects on soils except that surface soil moisture and
   NO3--N in the deep profile were consistently lower with minimum tillage.
   Minimum tillage tended to decrease lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and broccoli
   (Brassica oleracea) yields, but was not associated with increased pest
   problems. Weed density of shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris) and
   burning nettle (Urtica urens) were occasionally lower in the +OM
   treatments. Disease and pest severity on lettuce was slight in all
   treatments, but for one date, corky root disease (caused by Rhizomonas
   suberifaciens) was lower in the +OM treatments. The Pea Leafminer,
   Liriomyza huidobrensis, was unaffected by management treatments.
   Economic analysis of the three lettuce crops showed that net financial
   returns were highest with minimum tillage -OM inputs, despite lower
   yields. Various tradeoffs suggest that farmers should alternate between
   conventional and minimum tillage, with frequent additions of OM, to
   enhance several aspects of soil quality, and reduce disease and yield
   problems that can occur with continuous minimum tillage. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{A 6-year study was conducted in an organically managed orange orchard
   located in Sicily (Southern Italy) to assess the effect of compost and
   organic fertiliser utilisation on soil quality. Adopting a
   randomised-block experimental design with three replicates, four
   treatments were carried out. In treatments 1 and 2, two different
   composts (C1 from distillery by-products and C2 from livestock waste)
   were applied. The plots of treatment 3 were fertilised using dried
   poultry manure. The control treatment was fertilised by
   mineral/synthetic fertilisers. In order to verify the hypothesis that
   composts and organic fertilisers improve soil fertility, soil quality
   was evaluated by selecting dynamic soil parameters, as indicators linked
   to C and N cycles. Total organic C, total N, C/N ratio, humified
   fraction, isoelectric focussing (IEF) of extracted organic matter,
   microbial biomass C, potentially mineralisable N under anaerobic
   conditions, potentially mineralisable C, C mineralisation quotient and
   metabolic quotient were determined for each sample. Moreover, the
   Community Level Physiological Profile (by Biolog technique) was defined,
   calculating derived functional biodiversity and versatility indexes.
   Parameters related to IEF and potentially mineralisable C showed
   significant differences among the treatments. Moreover, total C, total N
   and humification parameters tended to increase, while no differences
   were observed in biodiversity indexes. On these findings, it was
   concluded that composts and poultry manure only weakly affected soil
   properties, though they increased soil potentially available nutritive
   elements to crops.}},

Abstract = {{The sustainability of inorganic `green revolution' rice-growing
   technology has been called into question because of the resulting
   depletion of soil quality and the susceptibility of crops to pest
   infestations. This, together with health concerns about the use of
   chemicals in the production of foods, raises the question of whether it
   might be feasible to return to organic methods for the production of
   rice in Indonesia. This paper describes an experiment along these lines.
   It was found that organic farming methods could be used with only a
   small decline in yields per hectare, but that local demand for organic
   rice produced domestically was not strong enough to generate sales at
   prices that would cover higher production costs. If organic farming
   methods are to be adopted in Indonesia, therefore, it may be necessary
   to focus on exporting to countries where there is a potentially strong
   consumer demand for organic rice.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical rain forests, some of the most diverse natural communities,
   have been characterized either as inherently stable or as extremely
   fragile. Theoretically, complex food webs allow for alternative pathways
   and overlapping functions within and among trophic levels, such that
   cascading effects are buffered and perturbation is resisted. On the
   other hand, strong interdependence among species and trophic levels in
   these same systems can make them vulnerable to perturbation. To assess
   the ability of a tropical rain forest community to resist perturbation
   or to amplify perturbation through trophic cascades, we measured changes
   in overall vegetative cover and species richness of understory plants in
   response to the experimental addition of a top predator beetle.
   In August 2000, 30 randomly located patches of naturally occurring Piper
   cenocladum shrubs were found at sites with variable soil quality and
   light availability, and top predator addition treatments were randomly
   assigned to half the patches. Using an 8-m(2) subplot within each P.
   cenocladum patch, we estimated (nondestructively) vegetative cover of
   understory plants for nine months and measured herbivore damage, plant
   longevity and plant species richness for similar to1.5 years.
   For all understory species in our subplots, vegetative cover and total
   numbers of leaves declined significantly more in predator addition
   patches than in control patches. Understory cover also declined
   significantly more on poor soils than on rich soils. Mortality of small
   plants was high overall, but longevity was significantly greater in
   control patches than in patches with top predators. Herbivore damage was
   lowest, plant establishment highest, and the accumulation of new plant
   species highest in control plots on rich soils. The cumulative effect of
   top predators interacted with plant resources, such that plant species
   richness was suppressed when beetles were present in understory
   communities on rich soils. Patterns of herbivore damage suggest that
   trophic cascades from apex predators through ant predators to herbivores
   altered the structure of understory vegetation. The presence of indirect
   effects supports the characterization of rain forests as vulnerable
   ecosystems whose integrity may be threatened by the slow erosion of
   complex tight interactions among species.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of metal contamination on natural populations of Collembola
   in soils from five sites in the Wolverhampton area ( West Midlands,
   England) were examined. Analysis revealed that metal concentrations were
   elevated above background levels at all sites. One location in
   particular (Ladymoor, a former smelting site) was highly contaminated
   with Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn at more than 20 times background levels.
   Biodiversity indices ( Shannon - Weiner, Simpson index, Margalef index,
   alpha index, species richness, Shaneven ( evenness) and Berger - Parker
   dominance) were calculated. Of these indices, estimates of species
   richness and evenness were most effective at highlighting the
   differences between the Collembola communities. Indeed, the highest
   number of species were found at the most contaminated site, although the
   Collembola population also had a comparatively low evenness value, with
   just two species dominating. The number of individuals per species were
   allocated into geometric classes and plotted against the cumulative
   number of species as a percentage. At Ladymoor, there were more
   geometric classes, and the slope of the line was shallower than at the
   other four sites. This characteristic is a feature of polluted sites,
   where a few species are dominant and most species are rare. The Ladymoor
   soil also had a dominance of Isotomurus palustris, and was the only site
   in which Ceratophysella denticulata was found. Previous studies have
   shown that these two species are often found in sites subject to high
   metal contamination. Survival and reproduction of the ``standard'' test
   springtail, Folsomia candida (Willem), were determined in a 4 week
   exposure test to soils from all five sites. Mortality was significantly
   increased in adults and reproduction significantly lower in the Ladymoor
   soil in comparison to the other four sites. This study has shown that
   severe metal contamination can be related to the population structure of
   Collembola in the field, and performance of F. candida ( in soils from
   such sites) in the laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{In Sicily, the increasing scarcity of good-quality waters is spreading
   irrigation with saline-sodic waters, thus enhancing the risk of soil
   secondary salinization and sodication. Sustainable management strategies
   are urgently needed in Sicily to prevent extent of salinization and
   sodication, thus preserving soil quality. Since irrigation is performed
   in cracking soils using irrigation systems involving high application
   rates, bypass flow of water and solutes occurs during irrigation. The
   objectives of this paper were (i) to investigate the process of Na-Ca
   exchange and subsequent salinization/sodication during bypass flow and
   (ii) to explore possibilities of using cyclic strategies, based on
   alternating good-quality waters to saline solutions, to prevent
   salinization. Six NaCl-CaCl2 solutions (named 1-6) with the following
   values of sodium adsorption ratio (SAR, {[}mmol(c)/l](0.5)) and of
   cationic concentration (C, mmol(c)/l)-(1) SAR = 5, C = 20; (2) SAR = 5,
   C = 1; (3) SAR = 15, C = 25; (4) SAR = 15, C = 2; (5) SAR = 30, C = 30;
   and (6) SAR = 30, C = 5-were prepared in laboratory. Two undisturbed
   soil columns were sampled in a Sicilian irrigated area where a risk of
   secondary salinization and sodication was indicated by previous
   investigations. Bypass flow experiments were performed by supplying the
   six solutions to each soil column in the order from I to 6 at an almost
   constant initial value of the cracking volume, using an application
   intensity determining occurrence of bypass flow. Results of experiments
   showed that in concomitance with bypass flow, (1) a process of Na-Ca
   exchange occurred, with Na adsorption and accumulation in the soil. In
   both the two columns, the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) was found
   to increase by about 100\% at the end of the six bypass flow
   experiments. Being the volume of the supplied saline/sodic solutions
   much smaller than the pore volume, this result indicates that a
   considerable risk of sodication may occur under bypass flow conditions;
   (2) cyclic strategies are useful for preventing accumulation of solutes
   when solutions with SAR close to the soil ESP are used. Instead, when
   solutions with SAR higher than the initial ESP are supplied to the same
   soil, due to the Na-Ca exchange and subsequent sodication, alternating
   waters having not only lower C but also lower SAR could be necessary to
   prevent salinization and sodication. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Transformation of thicket to savanna reduces soil quality in the Eastern
   Cape, South Africa}},

Pages = {{153-163}},

Abstract = {{Xeric succulent thicket in the Eastern Cape, South Africa has been used
   for farming goats since the early 1900s. This habitat is characterised
   by a dense cover of the succulent bush Portulacaria afra and by a warm,
   semi-arid climate with evenly distributed annual rainfall of 250-400 mm.
   Heavy browsing by goats results in the loss of R afra and transforms the
   thicket to an open savanna dominated by annual grasses. Eight fence-line
   comparisons between thicket and savanna were used to investigate
   differences in soil quality associated with the vegetation change.
   Composite soil samples were taken to a depth of 10 cm from 1 ha plots on
   either side of the fence-line. Associated with the change from thicket
   to savanna, a significant decrease (paired t-test, P < 0.05) was found
   in total C (respective means of 5.6 vs. 3.0\%), total N (0.33 vs.
   0.24\%), labile C (2.8 vs. 1.5\%), CO(2) flux (1-9 vs 0.5 mumol m(-2)
   s(-1)), soil respiration in the laboratory (144 vs. 79 ng C kg(-1)
   s(-1)), (NH(4))OAc-extractable Mg (55 vs. 28 mmol(c) kg(-1)), and
   laboratory infiltration rate (51 vs. 19 mm h(-1)). In the same direction
   there was a similarly significant increase in modulus of rupture (16 vs.
   34 kPa), water-soluble Ca (2.3 vs. 3.4 mmol(c) kg(-1)) and pH (6.7 vs.
   7.7). The soil C content of 5.6\% in thicket is surprisingly high in
   this warm, semi-arid climate and suggests that the dense P afra bush
   strongly regulates soil organic matter through microclimate, erosion
   control, litter quantity and perhaps chemistry. Savanna soils had a
   greater tendency to crust (as evident in a lower rate of laboratory
   infiltration and greater modulus of rupture) than thicket soils. This
   was attributed to their lower organic matter content, which probably
   reduced aggregate stability. Savannas are likely to be more prone to
   runoff and erosion not only because of sparser vegetation but also
   because of a decline in soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Soil sealing and erosion on agricultural fields is a severe problem that
   often leads to increased runoff and decreased soil quality. Much
   research has been conducted using polyacrylamide (PAM) to control soil
   sealing and reduce erosion, yet few studies have attempted to determine
   the most effective molecular formulation(s) of PAM. Our objective was to
   examine the ability of a range of PAM formulations to stabilize soil
   aggregates. We hypothesized that PAM would perform differently on an
   assortment of soil types with varying optimum formulations and
   effectiveness. The PAM solutions studied included combinations of three
   molecular weights (MW: 6, 12, and 18 Mg mol(-1)) and three charge
   densities (CD: 20, 30, and 40\% hydrolysis). The soils used varied in
   both texture and mineralogy: Heiden clay (fine, smectitic, thermic Udic
   Haplusterts), Cecil sandy loam (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic
   Kanhapludults), and Fincastle silt loam (fine-silty mixed, superactive,
   mesic Aeric Epiaqualfs). Soil samples treated with PAMs of different
   formulations were analyzed using a fall velocity settling tube. A
   slaking index (SI) and an aggregate stabilization index (ASI) were used
   to compare the treatments. Polyacrylamide enhanced resistance to slaking
   of Fincastle silt loam but not Heiden clay or Cecil sandy loam.
   Furthermore, differences among PAM treatments were observed only for the
   Fincastle silt loam. When examining slaking and dispersion components
   together, PAM treated aggregates were more stable than the control for
   Heiden clay and Fincastle silt loam soils. For Heiden clay, CD was the
   main factor influencing aggregate stability, whereas CD x MW controlled
   the stability of Cecil sandy loam. Fincastle silt loam exhibited no
   preference to a specific PAM formulation factor. Polyacrylamide was
   effective in enhancing the stability of aggregates; however, it may not
   be as important in controlling the slaking component specifically.}},

Abstract = {{The extreme climate of the northern Great Plains of North America
   requires cropping systems to possess a resilient soil resource in order
   to be sustainable. This paper summarizes the interactive effects of
   tillage, crop sequence, and cropping intensity on soil quality
   indicators for two long-term cropping system experiments in the northern
   Great Plains. The experiments, located in central North Dakota, were
   established in 1984 and 1993 on a Wilton silt loam (FAO: Calcic Siltic
   Chernozem; USDA(1): fine-silty, mixed, superactive frigid Pachic
   Haplustoll). Soil physical, chemical, and biological properties
   considered as indicators of soil quality were evaluated in spring 2001
   in both experiments at depths of 0-7.5, 7.5-15, and 15-30 cm. Management
   effects on soil properties were largely limited to the surface 7.5 cm in
   both experiments. For the experiment established in 1984, differences in
   soil condition between a continuous crop, no-till system and a
   crop-fallow, conventional tillage system were substantial. Within the
   surface 7.5 cm, the continuous crop, no-till system possessed
   significantly more soil organic C (by 7.28 Mg ha(-1)), particulate
   organic matter C (POM-C) (by 4.98 Mg ha(-1)), potentially mineralizable
   N (PMN) (by 32.4 kg ha(-1)), and microbial biomass C (by 586 kg ha(-1)),
   as well as greater aggregate stability (by 33.4\%) and faster
   infiltration rates (by 55.6 cm h(-1)) relative to the crop-fallow,
   conventional tillage system. Thus, soil from the continuous crop,
   no-till system was improved with respect to its ability to provide a
   source for plant nutrients, withstand erosion, and facilitate water
   transfer. Soil properties were affected less by management practices in
   the experiment established in 1993, although organic matter related
   properties tended to be greater under continuous cropping or minimum
   tillage than crop sequences with fallow or no-till. In particular, PMN
   and microbial biomass C were greatest in continuous spring wheat (with
   residue removed) (22.5 kg ha(-1) for PMN; 792 kg ha(-1) for microbial
   biomass Q as compared with sequences with fallow (SW-S-F and SW-F)
   (Average = 15.9 kg ha(-1) for PMN; 577 kg ha(-1) for microbial biomass
   Q. Results from both experiments confirm that farmers in the northern
   Great Plains of North America can improve soil quality and agricultural
   sustainability by adopting production systems that employ intensive
   cropping practices with reduced tillage management. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Producers often identify compaction as an important problem, so bulk
   density is usually included in minimum data sets used to evaluate
   tillage and crop management effects on soil quality. The hypothesis for
   this study was that bulk density and associated water content would be
   useful soil quality indicators for evaluating the transitional effects
   associated with changing tillage and crop management practices on
   deep-loess soils. The study was conducted on three deep-loess,
   field-scale watersheds located in western Iowa, USA. The soils are
   classified as Haplic Phaeozems, Cumulic-Haplic Phaeozems, and Calearic
   Regosols. Watersheds 1 and 2 were converted in 1996 from conventional
   tillage to no-tillage, while watershed 3 was maintained using
   ridge-tillage and continuous corn (Zea mays L.), a practice implemented
   in 1972. Watershed I was converted to a corn-soybean (Glycine max (L.)
   Merr.) rotation while watershed 2 was converted to a 6-year rotation
   that included corn, soybean, corn plus 3 years of alfalfa (Medicago
   sativa L.). Bulk density and water content were measured at three
   landscape positions (summit, side-slope, and toe-slope), in 20 mm
   increments to a depth of 300 mm, five times between September 1996 and
   May 2000. Organic C and total N were also measured to a depth of 160 mm
   during the initial sampling. Neither bulk density nor water content
   showed any significant differences between the two watersheds being
   converted to no-tillage or between them and the ridge-till watershed.
   There also were no significant differences among landscape positions.
   Bulk densities and water contents showed some differences when adjacent
   sampling dates were compared, but there was no overall or consistent
   trend. Our results show that bulk density is not a useful soil quality
   indicator for these soils within the bulk density range encountered
   (0.8-1.6 Mg m(3)). Our results also confirm that producers do not
   necessarily have to worry about increased compaction when using
   ridge-tillage or changing from conventional to no-tillage practices on
   these or similar deep-loess soils. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The least limiting water range (LLWR) attempts to incorporate
   crop-limiting values of soil strength, aeration, and water supply to
   plant roots into one effective parameter (on the basis of soil water
   content). The LLWR can be a useful indicator of soil quality and soil
   physical constraints on crop production. This study focused on assessing
   dynamic cultivation zone LLWR parameters between different
   cropping/tillage/trafficked clay loam plots at Winchester, Ont., to
   identify potential management impact on surficial soil physical
   conditions for contrasting growing seasons. This study also evaluated
   dynamic cultivation layer LLWR variables as indicators of corn (Zea mays
   L.) plant establishment and corn yield. The results suggest that no-till
   soils had lower average air-filled porosities (AFP) and O-2
   concentrations than respectively managed tilled plots for both years of
   study. Potential trafficking effects on aeration properties were most
   evident in no-till relative to till; preferentially trafficked no-tilled
   plots had lower AFP and O-2 concentrations than respective
   non-preferentially trafficked no-till plots for both years of study.
   Corn establishment and yield variability were principally explained by
   cumulative differences between daily AFP and aeration threshold values,
   and the cumulative number of days daily AFP was below an AFP aeration
   threshold for specific corn growth stage periods. Lower AFP was linked
   to lower yields and plant establishments. Soil strength, as measured by
   cone penetration resistance, was important over certain sites, but not
   as important globally as AFP in predicting crop properties. Overall,
   conventional tilled soils that were not preferentially trafficked had
   most favorable aeration properties, and subsequently, greatest corn
   populations and yields. No-till soils were at greater risk of aeration
   limiting conditions, especially those in continuous corn and
   preferentially trafficked. Crown Copyright (C) 2004 Published by

Abstract = {{How do different soil tillage systems influence soil quality over the
   years? Under moist cool conditions is it possible in the long term to
   reduce dramatically soil tillage intensity without experiencing
   reductions in yield or other problems? In 1987, the Swiss Federal
   Research Station for Agricultural Economics and Engineering in Tanikon
   initiated a long-term soil tillage trial to clarify these questions. The
   trial compared mouldboard plough, chisel, paraplow, shallow tillage and
   no-tillage systems on a well-drained Orthic Luvisol with 160 g kg(-1)
   clay, 310 g kg(-1) silt, and under a climate that has a mean annual
   precipitation of 1180 mm. The tillage treatment effects were evaluated
   by measuring several biological, chemical, and physical soil quality
   indicators. Reduced soil tillage increased earthworm populations,
   reduced Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides infection in wheat (Triticum
   aestivum) and increased plant colonisation by arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi. Yields for no-tillage and other ploughless cultivation techniques
   were on par with those obtained by ploughing. An exception was
   direct-drilled maize (Zea mays), where no-tillage decreased yield by
   more than 10\% over the course of 14 years. In the first 7 years of the
   trial, the level of soil organic carbon in all the tillage regimes was
   approximately 40\% lower than natural grassland (initial situation 1987
   = 75 Mg SOC ha(-1)). The no-tillage method did not differ from the
   others in respect of bulk density, but it showed an increased
   preconsolidation stress and hence better trafficability. Under
   Switzerland's moist cool climatic conditions, it is possible to reduce
   soil tillage intensity without substantial reductions in yield, and at
   the same time improve soil quality. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The philosophy toward tillage throughout the last century in Hungary can
   be characterized as a fight against extreme climatic and economic
   situations. The `Hungarian reasonable tillage' approach that was
   promoted by Cserhati at the end of the 1800s was aimed at reducing
   tillage without increasing the risk of crop failure in arable fields.
   Recently, new tillage trends and systems have been introduced because of
   the rise in energy prices and because of the need to cut production
   costs, conserve soil and water resources and protect the environment. In
   Hungarian relation, the rationalized plowing, loosening and mulching
   systems are counted to the new tillage solutions. There are new steps in
   the sowing methods too, such as seedbed preparation and plant in one
   pass, till and plant, mulch-till and plant and direct drilling, which
   are environment capable, throughout improving soil condition and
   avoiding the environment harms. The applicability of various soil
   conservation tillage methods is currently being tested in research
   projects and discussed in workshops throughout the country. In this
   paper, soil quality problems such as compaction, trends in soil tillage,
   and factors affecting soil quality or condition as well as improvement
   and maintenance are summarized. The data show that annual disking and
   plowing causes subsoil compaction at the depth of tillage within 3 years
   and that the compacted layer expanded both in surface and deeper layers
   after the 5th year. Soil quality deterioration by tillage-pans was
   improved by subsoiling and maintained by direct drilling and planting
   soil-loosening catch crops. Within a loam and a sandy loam soil there
   were close correlations between earthworm activity and soil quality.
   Earthworm numbers increased on undisturbed but noncompacted soils and
   soils that included stubble residues remaining on the surface, but did
   not increase on soils that were deteriorated by tillage-pans or left
   bare by the absence of mulch. Our goal for the new millennium, is to use
   only enough tillage to create and maintain harmony between soil
   conservation, soil quality and crop production. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Soil erosion continues to be a primary cause for soil degradation and
   the loss of soil quality throughout the world. Our objectives were to
   quantify soil erosion (referred to as erosional drift) and to assign
   erosion risk to six tillage and crop management treatments evaluated
   from 1995 to 1999 for a 5-year maize (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine
   hyspida L.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), oil-seed rape
   (Brassica napus var. oleifera L.), and spring barley (Hordeum vulgare
   L.) plus double-crop soybean rotation on Stagnic Luvisols in central
   Croatia. Standard black fallow (tilled, unsown, and without any
   vegetative cover) Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) plots were used to
   establish the erosion potential associated with the rainfall pattern for
   each year. Soil loss from the check plots was several times greater than
   the T value, which is estimated to be 10 t ha(-1) per year. During the 2
   years when spring seeded maize or soybean were grown (1995 and 1996)
   erosion risk was extremely high, especially for treatments where tillage
   and planting (row direction) were up and down the slope. When autumn
   seeded winter wheat or oil-seed rape were grown (1996/1997 or
   1997/1998), soil erosion was insignificant. Also, except when plowing
   and sowing were up and down slope, erosion loss for the spring barley
   plus double-crop soybean crops in 1999 was insignificant. With
   no-tillage, soil erosion from the maize and soybean crops was reduced 40
   and 65\% compared to plowing up and down slope, even though the planting
   direction was still up and down the slope. With the exception of maize
   in 1995, erosion losses were moderate to insignificant when plowing and
   planting were performed across the slope. We conclude that erosion risk
   can be used as a reliable indicator of sustainable land management and
   that using no-tillage or plowing and planting perpendicular to the
   predominant slope are effective soil conservation practices for this
   region. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water, wind, or tillage-induced soil erosion can significantly degrade
   soil quality. Therefore, understanding soil displacement through tillage
   translocation is an important step toward developing tillage practices
   that do not degrade soil resources. Our primary objective was to
   determine the effects of soil condition (i.e. grassland stubble versus
   previously tilled soil), opening angle, and harrow speed on soil
   translocation. A second field study also conducted on a Lixisol but only
   in the stubble field, quantified displacement effects of mouldboard
   ploughing. The field studies were located 12 km South of Evora,
   Portugal. Soil displacement or translocation after each tillage
   operation in both studies was measured using aluminium cubes with a side
   length of 15 mm as `tracers'. Offset angles for the harrow disk were
   20degrees, 44degrees and 59degrees; tractor velocities ranged from 1.9
   to 7.0 km h(-1) and tillage depth ranged from 4 to I I cm. The depth of
   mouldboard ploughing was approximately 40 cm with a wheel speed of 3.7
   km h(-1). The translocation coefficients for the two implements were
   very different averaging 770 kg m(-1) for the mouldboard plough and
   ranging from 9 to 333 kg m(-1) for the harrow disk. This shows that the
   mouldboard plough was more erosive than the harrow disk in these
   studies. All three variables (soil condition, opening angle, and tillage
   velocity) were critical factors affecting the translocation coefficient
   for the harrow disk. Displacement distances were the largest for
   compacted soils (stubble field), with higher opening or offset angles,
   and at higher velocities. The results also showed significant
   correlation for (a) mean soil displacement in the direction of tillage
   and the slope gradient and (b) soil transport coefficient and the
   opening angle. Our results can be used to predict the transport
   coefficient (a potential soil quality indicator for tillage erosion) for
   the harrow disk, provided tillage depth, opening angle, and tool
   operating speed are known. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tillage-induced soil erosion or redistribution increases spatial
   variation of several soil properties and often reduces the productive
   capacity of soil resources. Our objectives were to identify the extent
   of this type of erosion by observing the changes in soil morphological
   properties in the field and analysing its possible effects on soil
   productivity. The study was initiated in 2001 and conducted at two
   irrigated sites located approximately at Terena, Alandrol, 80 km east of
   Evora, Portugal. They were planted to corn (Zea mays L.) during this
   study, but have a long history of agricultural use with a trend toward
   increasing intensity in recent years. Soils in the field studies are
   classified mainly as Calcaric Regosols, Calcaric Cambisols, Luvisols and
   small areas of Fluvisols. The amount of erosion was estimated by
   simulation and verified by describing the lithology and measuring soil
   carbonates. The presence of carbonates in the superficial Ap horizons of
   soils that were previously devoid of this compound, provide evidence of
   soil redistribution: (1) in soils derived from calcareous parent
   material, this is the result of a re-carbonation process; (2) in soils
   derived from non-calcareous parent material the presence of carbonates
   in the superficial Ap horizons results from a carbonation process. On
   both sites, A and B, approximately 17\% of the soils sampled were either
   carbonated or re-carbonated. Carbonation and re-carbonation of soil
   profiles confirmed that tillage had redistributed the soil-ploughing
   layer over time. Decreased com yield was also observed as slope
   increase. If current agricultural practices are continued in this area,
   a decrease in soil quality and maximum yield on higher slopes can be
   expected. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality is a concept that integrates soil biological, chemical and
   physical factors into a framework for soil resource evaluation.
   Conventional tillage practices can result in a loss of soil organic
   matter and decreased soil quality. The potential for soil quality
   degradation with tillage may vary depending upon landscape position and
   the spatial distribution of critical soil properties. Information on how
   to accurately integrate soil spatial information across fields,
   landscapes and watersheds is lacking in the literature. The primary
   objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term effect of
   conventional and ridge-tillage on soil quality in three small watersheds
   at the Deep Loess Research Station near the town of Treynor in southwest
   Iowa. Soil types included Monona silt loams in summit positions, Ida or
   Dow silt loams in backslope positions, and Napier or Kennebec silt loams
   in footslope positions. We removed surface soil cores from transects
   placed along topographic gradients in each watershed and quantified
   total soil organic C (SOC), total soil N (TN), particulate organic
   matter C (POM-C) and N (POM-N), microbial biomass C (MB-C), N
   mineralization potential (PMIN-N), nitrate N, extractable P and K, pH,
   water-stable macroaggregates (WSA), and bulk density (131)). We used
   terrain analysis methods to group the data into landform element classes
   to evaluate the effect of topographic position on soil quality. Results
   indicate that soil quality is higher under long-term ridge-tillage
   compared with conventional tillage. Soil quality differences were
   consistently documented among the three watersheds by: (1)
   quantification of soil indicator variables, (2) calculation of soil
   quality index values, and (3) comparison of indicator variable and index
   results with independent assessments of soil function endpoints (i.e.
   sediment loss, water partitioning at the soil surface, and crop yield).
   Soil quality differences under ridge-till were found specifically for
   the backslope and shoulder landform elements, suggesting that soil
   quality increases on these landform elements are responsible for higher
   watershed-scale soil quality in the ridge-tilled watershed. Published by

Abstract = {{Poland, one of the candidate countries for European Union membership, is
   currently experiencing acute structural problems within its agriculture
   sector. This article analyses technical efficiency and its determinants
   for a panel of individual farms in Poland specialized in crop and
   livestock production in 2000. Technical efficiency is estimated with
   stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and confidence intervals are
   constructed. Determinants of inefficiency are also evaluated. The SFA
   results are compared with results using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA).
   On average, livestock farms are more technically efficient than crop
   farms. For both specializations, the size-efficiency relationship is
   positive, that is large farms are more efficient. The SFA findings are
   generally supported by the DEA results. Soil quality and the degree of
   integration with downstream markets are highly important determinants of
   efficiency. The use of factor markets (land and labour) is important for
   crop farms, while livestock farms can rely on family labour and own
   land. Also, education is a constraint to efficiency particularly for
   crop farms.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely believed that tropical soils (mainly Oxisols) have
   excellent physical characteristics such as high infiltration rates, high
   permeability of water, good and stable soil structure and that
   consequently, they can support mechanized agriculture. However in the
   Eastern Plains (Llanos Orientales) of Colombia, when Oxisols are
   subjected to tillage using disc harrow, soil physical conditions
   deteriorate rapidly. We report here that change in land use with
   deep-rooted tropical pastures can enhance soil quality by improving the
   size and stability of soil aggregates when compared with soils under
   monocropping. In addition, rates of water infiltration improved by
   5-10-fold while rainfall acceptance capacity improved by 3-5-fold. We
   suggest that intensive and sustainable use of these Oxisols, could only
   be possible if an ``arable{''} or ``productive layer{''} (i.e. a layer
   with improved soil physical, chemical and biological properties) is
   constructed and maintained. One option to achieve this arable layer is
   through the use of introduced tropical pastures with deep-rooting
   abilities that can result in increased soil organic matter and
   associated improvements in soil physical, chemical and biological
   properties. One land use option that can achieve these soil improvements
   is agropastoralism whereby pastures and crops are grown in short-term
   rotations. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Living mulches of legumes are permanent cover crops that can fix
   atmospheric N and improve soil quality. The objectives of this study
   were to determine effects of living mulches on corn (Zea mays L.) yield
   and N fertilizer response and on soil quality. In this split-plot
   design, living mulches were main plots and N rates (0-225 kg ha(-1) N)
   subplots. Living mulches were crownvetch (Coronilla varia L.) cultivars
   Penngift and Pennmulch, flatpea (Lathyrus sylvestris L.) cultivar
   Lathco, birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) cultivars Empire and
   Steadfast, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), and galega (Galega
   officinalis L.). The crop was rainfed imidazolinone (IMI)-resistant corn
   on a Murrill silt loam (Typic Hapludult) in central Pennsylvania. Only
   crownvetch, flatpea, and birdsfoot trefoil (BIT) cultivars survived the
   herbicide program. Living mulches did not reduce corn yields, except in
   the dry year of 1995. The average N fertilizer equivalency of Penngift,
   Pennmulch, Empire, Steadfast, and Lathco was 71, 45, 44, 13, and 50 kg
   ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, at 0 N rates. Their N fertilizer
   equivalency decreased to zero, however, with increasing N fertilizer
   rates. Bulk density, soil organic C content, and infiltration rate were
   not significantly improved after 10 yr of Penngift living mulch. When
   suppressed severely, crownvetch, BIT, and flatpea can be managed without
   yield reduction to IMI-resistant corn, but then N contribution to corn
   and soil quality benefits will be limited. For maximum corn yield, full
   N rates are required with these living mulches.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of an integrated multifunctional river management is gaining
   importance. For major rivers, restoring the contact between rivers and
   alluvial plains is an important goal, as riparian areas have a specific
   role for several riverine processes. However, former and current human
   activities are an obstruction or a limitation for river restoration. We
   studied the influence of former dredging activities along the river Leie
   on the alluvial plain quality. A soil survey and an archive query for
   reconstructing the history of dredging operations were conducted
   simultaneously. The geographical impact expressed as topographical
   changes and covering of the original soil profile and related processes
   and biota was large. The pollution status of dredged sediment-derived
   soils was found to be far from negligible: concentrations of Cd, Cr, and
   Zn were, in 10\% of the cases, higher than 20, 480, and 2800 mg kg(-1)
   DM, respectively. Both agriculture and nature rehabilitation on dredged
   sediment-derived soils can only be accepted after profound risk
   assessment, and management should focus on ecological risk reduction.
   Results indicate the importance of soil quality assessment in alluvial
   plains for an integrated river management, rather than a priori assuming
   pristine soil conditions. The collected ``off-line{''} sediment data can
   be used as a reconstruction of past sediment pollution, especially when
   long-term sediment monitoring programs are not available.}},

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted to investigate the long-term effect of
   surface application of sewage sludge composts vs chemical N fertilizer
   on total N, total C, soluble organic C, pH, EC, microbial biomass C and
   N, protease activity, deaminase activity, urease activity, gross and net
   rates of N mineralization and nitrification, CO2 evolution, and N2O
   production. Soil samples were taken from five depths (0-15, 15-20,
   20-30, 30-40, and 40-50 cm) of a long-term experiment at the University
   of Tokyo, Japan. Three fields have been receiving sewage sludge
   composted with rice husk (RH), sawdust (SD), or mixed chemical
   fertilizer NPK (CF), applied at the rate of 240 kg N ha(-1) each in
   split applications in summer and autumn since 1978. Significantly higher
   amounts of total N and C and soluble organic C were found in the compost
   than in the CF treatments up to the 40-cm soil depth, indicating
   improved soil quality in the former. In the CF treatment, soil pH values
   were significantly lower and electrical conductivity values were
   significantly higher than those of compost-treated soils of up to 50 cm
   depth. Soil microbial biomass C and N, CO2 evolution, protease,
   deaminase, and urease activities were significantly higher in the
   compost than in the CF treatments due to greater availability of organic
   substrates that stimulated microbial activity. Gross N mineralization
   rates determined by N-15 dilution technique were eight and five times
   higher in the SD and RH treatments than in the CF treatment,
   respectively, probably due to high levels of microbial and enzyme
   activities. Net N mineralization rates were also significantly higher in
   the compost treatments and were negative in the CF treatment indicating
   immobilization. Net nitrification rates were higher in compost
   treatments and negative in the CF treatment. Nitrous oxide productions
   from compost treatments were higher than the CF treatment due to the
   greater availability of mineral N as a result of higher mineralization
   and nitrification rates and soluble organic C in the former. Most of the
   measured parameters were highest in the surface soil (0-15 cm) and were
   significantly higher in the SD treatment than in the RH treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Soils are fundamental to urban environmental quality. They have
   aesthetic and recreational functions in parks and gardens and contribute
   to the preservation of biodiversity. They also directly influence
   citizens' health. This paper describes the initial development of a
   decision support tool (DST) to appraise the urban soil resource and its
   valuable functions within a wide range of urban environments. It is
   aimed to provide assistance to local, national, and European authorities
   in the optimum planning and sustainable management of their soils
   resources. The DST is an integrated information technology system based
   on a spatially distributed environmental database management system of
   soil quality parameters and soil characteristics together with broader
   environmental factors. The integration is achieved through the
   implementation of the DST within the framework of a geographical
   information system coupled with risk assessment, pollution decay, and
   other models including the handling of ``soft'' data. The DST will be
   web-based, allowing wide access to all stakeholders and citizens,
   providing on-line forums for consultations, and exchange of information
   and feedback among stakeholders. It is designed to support true
   transparency in decision making at the local and international levels.
   The paper focuses specifically on the development of the system
   architecture of the DST.}},

Abstract = {{State-and-transition models are increasingly being used to guide
   rangeland management. These models provide a relatively simple,
   management-oriented way to classify land condition (state) and to
   describe the factors that might cause a shift to another state (a
   transition). There are many formulations of state-and-transition models
   in the literature. The version we endorse does not adhere to any
   particular generalities about ecosystem dynamics, but it includes
   consideration of several kinds of dynamics and management response to
   them. In contrast to previous uses of state-and-transition models, we
   propose that models can, at present, be most effectively used to specify
   and qualitatively compare the relative benefits and potential risks of
   different management actions (e.g., fire and grazing) and other factors
   (e.g., invasive species and climate change) on specified areas of land.
   High spatial and temporal variability and complex interactions preclude
   the meaningful use of general quantitative models. Forecasts can be made
   on a case-by-case basis by interpreting qualitative and quantitative
   indicators, historical data, and spatially structured monitoring data
   based on conceptual models. We illustrate how science- based conceptual
   models are created using several rangeland examples that vary in
   complexity. In doing so, we illustrate the implications of designating
   plant communities and states in models, accounting for varying scales of
   pattern in vegetation and soils, interpreting the presence of plant
   communities on different soils and dealing with our uncertainty about
   how those communities were assembled and how they will change in the
   future. We conclude with observations about how models have helped to
   improve management decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon (SOC) represents the largest constituent of the
   global C pool and is used by researchers in C cycling, global climate
   change, and soil quality studies. Spatial, pedon, and soil
   interpretation record databases are widely used to estimate regional
   SOC. This study compared published SOC estimates with estimates of mass
   SOC to 2 m in Maine and Minnesota using STATSGO data tables edited and
   filled by automated software scripts. Valid STATSGO soil property data
   were used to produce replacement values for invalid or missing data
   after grouping by soil order, MLRA, layer number, and texture.
   Area-weighted mass SOC was calculated using log-transformed data.
   Between 30\% and 54\% of the large rock fragment data were invalid, and
   between 18\% and 48\% of the missing OM values were replaced. The
   log-transformed area-weighted mass SOC to 2 m was 7.88 kg/m(2) (SD =
   9.24 kg C/m(2) CV = 117.2\%) for Maine and 17.38 kg/m(2) (SD = 15.30 kg
   C/m(2) CV = 88.1\%) for Minnesota. These values were lower than earlier
   estimates because of the log-transformation and because our error
   checking increased the volume of rock fragments. The FIA database was
   merged with STATSGO to produce mass SOC by forest-type group. The
   elm-ash-cottonwood (7.22 kg C/m(2)) and the spruce-fir (17.73 kg C/m(2))
   forest-type groups had the highest SOC (to 1 m depth) in Maine and
   Minnesota, respectively. The methods and scripts used in this study can
   be easily adjusted, and as they are improved, they in turn can improve
   the quality of data in STATSGO tables.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change will directly affect carbon and nitrogen mineralization
   through changes in temperature and soil moisture, but it may also
   indirectly affect mineralization rates through changes in soil quality.
   We used an experimental mesocosm system to examine the effects of 6-year
   manipulations of infrared loading (warming) and water-table level on the
   potential anaerobic nitrogen and carbon (as carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and
   methane (CH(4)) production) mineralization potentials of bog and fen
   peat over 11 weeks under uniform anaerobic conditions. To investigate
   the response of the dominant methanogenic pathways, we also analyzed the
   stable isotope composition of CH(4) produced in the samples. Bog peat
   from the highest water-table treatment produced more CO(2) than bog peat
   from drier mesocosms. Fen peat from the highest water-table treatment
   produced the most CH(4). Cumulative nitrogen mineralization was lowest
   in bog peat from the warmest treatment and lowest in the fen peat from
   the highest water-table treatment. As all samples were incubated under
   constant conditions, observed differences in mineralization patterns
   reflect changes in soil quality in response to climate treatments. The
   largest treatment effects on carbon mineralization as CO(2) occurred
   early in the incubations and were ameliorated over time, suggesting that
   the climate treatments changed the size and/or quality of a small labile
   carbon pool. CH(4) from the fen peat appeared to be predominately from
   the acetoclastic pathway, while in the bog peat a strong CH(4) oxidation
   signal was present despite the anaerobic conditions of our incubations.
   There was no evidence that changes in soil quality have lead to
   differences in the dominant methanogenic pathways in these systems.
   Overall, our results suggest that even relatively short-term changes in
   climate can alter the quality of peat in bogs and fens, which could
   alter the response of peatland carbon and nitrogen mineralization to
   future climate change.}},

   quality, tree nutrition, tree growth, crop yield and fruit quality were
   measured. Contact herbicide gave the poorest weed control, followed by
   residual herbicide. Very little weed intrusion occurred in the plastic
   and straw mulch treatments. The concentrations of soil biomass C,
   biomass N and respiration rates were consistently greatest under the
   straw mulch and contact herbicide, suggesting that C and N was
   incorporated into the soil biomass most efficiently under these
   treatments. Soil solution nitrate concentrations also were lowest under
   straw mulch and contact herbicide. The straw mulch increased the
   concentration of K in the surface soil (0-15 cm) compared with the other
   treatments, and this was reflected by consistently higher concentrations
   in the leaves of trees. The contact herbicide treatment had lower leaf
   concentrations of N in most years. Fruit mineral concentrations
   reflected leaf mineral concentrations. Trees growing in the straw mulch
   had the greatest shoot growth and those in the contact herbicide treated
   soil had the least. These increases are ascribed to the greater
   conservation of moisture within the profile during the shoot extension
   period. Differences in harvest yield between treatments were generally
   small in individual years, however cumulative differences occurred over
   six crops. Trees in the straw mulch had the greatest yields and mean
   fruit weights. The ground vegetation management systems did not
   influence fruit quality except in the second harvest, when yields were
   low and the individual fruit were large.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon storage in the soil organic matter (SOM) is an important strategy
   to mitigate carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the no-tillage
   (NT) use for six years, under four autumn (dry-season) cover crops based
   maize and soybean crop rotations (pigeon pea-pearl millet, bengan
   hemp-sorghum, sunflower-black oat, and wild radish-maize), on C storage
   in the particulate (>53 mum) and mineral-associated (<53 mum) SOM
   fractions of a clayey Oxisol from Brazilian Cerrado region. In
   comparison to conventional tillage (CT) under summer cash-crops, NT
   increased the total organic carbon (TOC) stocks in the surface soil
   layer (0-5 cm). In the top 20 cm layer, NT soil under wild radish-maize
   had 9\% (4.66 Mg ha(-1)) more TOC than the conventionally tilled soil.
   On the other hand, C storage in NT soil under other cropping systems was
   statiscally similar to the CT soil. The C stocks in the particulate SOM
   fraction increased by 37 to 52\% in NT soil (0-20 cm) in comparison to
   CT. The higher sensitivity to soil management changes made the
   particulate organic matter a more adequate soil quality index compared
   to the TOC stocks. The C stock in the mineral-associated SOM fraction
   was not affected by soil management systems, which can be related to the
   short-term under NT and or to the highly stable soil microaggregates in
   this clayey Oxisol. The preferential C storage in the labile SOM
   fraction is an environmental benefit, which is expected to occur only
   under continuous no-tillage and crop residues addition.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of the admixture of beech in spruce monocultures on structure
   and function of the decomposer community was studies in the Ore
   mountains (Saxony, Germany) on Dystric Cambisols between 2000 and 2002.
   The study sites represented four stages of forest conversion from a
   mature spruce stand to a mature spruce/beech stand. There, the
   functional profile of the nematodes, enchytraeids, lumbricids, and
   dipterans was analysed on the basis of ecological guilds, and their
   metabolic equivalences were calculated to characterize the decomposition
   potential of the invertebrate decomposer community. Because of the
   acidic parent soil the coenoses at all study sites were dominated by the
   enchytraeids with increasing importance of lumbricids and dipterans in
   progress of forest conversion. Gradual changes with rising coverage of
   beech culminated in intense differences of entire biomasses and
   metabolic equivalences between the mature stands, indicating a higher
   decomposition potential of the invertebrate decomposer community by the
   admixture of beeches in spruce forests. The quality of the beech litter
   is likely to be the important factors for these changes. To prove this
   assumption further investigations of the saprovore food chain are
   necessary, taking microbial parameters into account.}},

Abstract = {{Reclamation of disturbed soils is done with the primary objective of
   restoring the land. Therefore, measurement of physical and chemical
   properties of reclaimed minesoils (RMS) is essential for understanding
   the process of soil restoration. This study was designed to assess soil
   quality of two reclaimed sites and two nearby undisturbed sites in
   Jackson and Vinton counties, Ohio. Three different rates of fertilizers
   applied annually to the RMS at Jackson and Vinton County sites from
   1979-1994 were: no fertilizer (FL1), 112-25-46 kg NPK ha(-1) (FL2), and
   224-50-92 kg NPK ha(-1) (FL3). Bulk and core samples were obtained for
   only 0- to 10-cm depth for undisturbed (unmined) soil (UMS) and for 0 to
   10 and 10 to 20 cm for RMS. A comparison within UMS and RMS showed that
   water-stable aggregation and mean weight diameter of aggregates (MWDs)
   were significantly higher for UMS than RMS for both sites (P < 0.05).
   Apart from soil bulk density (rho(b)) for Vinton, no significant
   differences were observed in rho(b), electrical conductivity (EC), pH,
   saturated hydraulic conductivity and water infiltration for the 0- to
   10-cm depth among fertility treatments in RMS and UMS for both Jackson
   and Vinton County sites. Average soil organic C (SOC) 5 yr after
   reclamation in 1981 was 14.2 Mg ha(-1) for Jackson and 15.1 Mg ha(-1)
   for Vinton site for the 0- to 10-cm depth. In 2001, average SOC was 28.7
   Mg ha(-1) for Jackson and 30.24 Mg ha(-1) for Vinton site. A two-fold
   increase in SOC was obtained at both sites between 1981 and 2001. Soil
   pH was >6.4 and was favorable for root development and biomass
   production at both reclaimed sites. No significant differences in
   several soil properties between UMS and RMS showed that fertility
   treatments improved the soil quality of RMS.}},

Abstract = {{No-tillage offers potential for improved soil quality, reduced erosion,
   and equal or increased crop yields. We hypothesized that, compared with
   conservation tillage (CT), no-tillage (NT) offers conditions more
   conducive to microbial decay of weed seed. In NT systems seed remain at
   or near the soil surface where crop residues, moisture, and lack of
   disturbance create an environment with greater soil microbial diversity.
   In late fall of 1998 and 1999, dormant seed of wild oat, either
   individually glued to plastic toothpicks or mixed with soil and placed
   in mesh bags, were buried (mean seed depth of 2.5 cm) in replicated
   field plots managed by NT or CT since 1982. Treatments including
   fungicide seed treatment (thiram + metalaxyl + captan) and soil
   fumigation (propylene oxide) provided estimates of the contribution of
   microorganisms to observed mortality. Seed were retrieved in May and
   August, 1999 and 2000. Contrary to our original hypothesis, the
   proportion of dead seed was generally similar in NT and CT systems. Lack
   of tillage system by seed or soil treatments affecting the proportion of
   dead or decayed seed suggests that the contribution of microorganisms to
   seed fate is similar in these tillage environments. However, the
   proportion of dormant seed was consistently lower in the NT compared
   with CT treatments; there was a corresponding increase in the proportion
   of germinated seed. Overall, more than half of the wild oat seed bank
   losses could be directly attributed to germination whereas losses due to
   decay were relatively minor by comparison. Despite favorable
   distribution of seed and improved quality of the surface-strata of soil
   in NT systems, this study fails to provide evidence that enhanced
   microbial decay will contribute to a ``weed-suppressive{''} capacity in
   such cropping systems.}},

Abstract = {{Pinus radiata D. Don is planted in Spain, in a wide range of soils and
   climatic conditions. We aimed to identify the main site factors that
   control the productivity of this species and determine to what extent
   its growth is limited by the soil quality and the climate. For this
   purpose, we selected 22 stands of P. radiata on the basis of parent
   material (nine substrates) and climate (Mediterranean and Atlantic). The
   highest levels of forest productivity were unexpectedly found in the
   lower rainfall Mediterranean area, while the lowest ones were found in
   the wet Atlantic area. Litterfall showed the highest correlation with
   site index. Soil depth combined with altitude was also significantly
   related to site index. Principal component analysis, performed using a
   set of selected soil and site fertility variables, showed a separation
   between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean sites, suggesting that the
   soil processes determining soil fertility differ in the two climates.
   Within each climatic zone, site environmental variables were clearly
   associated with site index. In the Mediterranean area, site index was
   strongly related to soil depth and to the amount of P in the organic
   layers, while in the Atlantic area it was mainly associated with site
   altitude and mineral soil CEC. According to our results, Mediterranean
   plantations are confined to deep soils and their quality is also related
   to the amount and concentration of nutrients in the organic layers. On
   the other hand, the Atlantic plantations grow faster at lower elevations
   and they are also sensitive to soil fertility as their site quality is
   affected by CEC. The intensive management of these plantations is likely
   to increase productivity mainly in areas not limited by temperature. (C)

Abstract = {{Bottom soil samples were collected from 35 ponds in the vicinity of
   Samutprakarn, Thailand. Ponds ranged in age from 3 to 39 years and had
   been used continuously for production of tilapia. Liming materials had
   been applied in large amounts, and bottom soils of all ponds had pH
   above 7, low exchange acidity, and free carbonate. Pond soils often
   contained between 1\% and 2\% total sulphur, suggesting that they were
   potential acid-sulphate soils. However, acidity from sulphide oxidation
   was not expressed because carbonate in the soil neutralized it.
   Concentrations of total carbon seldom exceeded 4\% and the average for
   organic carbon was 1.90\%. The correlations between pond age and both
   total carbon and organic carbon concentration were weak (r=0.34 and 0.36
   respectively). Concentrations of nitrogen in bottom soils did not differ
   with pond age and ranged from 0.1\% to 0.3\% with an average of 0.19\%.
   The average ratio of concentrations of carbon and nitrogen was 11.
   Acid-extractable phosphorus concentrations averaged 217 mg kg(-1), but
   the phosphorus adsorption capacity averaged 768 mg kg(-1) suggesting
   that soils still have considerable reserve capacity to adsorb
   phosphorus. Ponds can be used annually for semi-intensive production of
   tilapia, and presumably other species, for many years without serious
   deterioration of bottom soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid changes in the social and economic environment in which
   agriculture is developing, together with the deterioration of the
   natural resource base threatens sustainability of farm systems in many
   areas of the world. For vegetable farms in South Uruguay, survival in
   the long term depends upon the development of production systems able to
   reduce soil erosion, maintain or improve physical and biological soil
   fertility, and increase farmer's income to socially acceptable levels.
   We propose a model-based explorative land use study to support the
   re-orientation of vegetable production systems in South Uruguay. In this
   paper we present a new method to quantitatively integrate agricultural,
   environmental and socio-economic aspects of agricultural land use based
   on explicit design objectives. We describe the method followed to design
   and evaluate a wide variety of land use activities for Canelon Grande
   (South Uruguay) and we illustrate the usefulness of this approach in an
   ex-ante evaluation of new farming systems using data from 25 farms in
   this region. Land use activities resulted from systematic combination of
   crops and inter-crop activities into crop rotations, different crop
   management techniques (i.e., mechanisation, irrigation and crop
   protection) and animal production. We identified and quantified all
   possible rotations and estimated inputs and outputs at crop rotation
   scale, explicitly considering interactions among crops. Relevant inputs
   and outputs (i.e., soil erosion, balance of soil organic matter and
   nutrients, environmental impact of pesticides, labour and machinery
   requirements, and economic performance) of each land use activity were
   quantified using different quantitative methods and following the
   target-oriented approach. By applying the methodology presented in this
   paper we were able to design and evaluate 336,128 land use activities
   suitable for the different soil types in Canelon Grande and for farms
   with different availability of resources, i.e., land, labour, soil
   quality, capital and water for irrigation. After theoretical evaluation,
   a large subset of these land use activities showed promise for reducing
   soil erosion, maintaining soil organic matter content of the soil and
   increasing farmer's income, allowing improvement of current farming
   systems in the region and providing a widely diverse set of strategic
   options for farmers in the region to choose from. This method can be
   used as a stand-alone tool to explore options at the field and farm
   scale or to generate input for optimisation models to explore options at
   the farm or regional scale. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the effects of application with primary-treated and
   nitrogen-reduced-treated animal processing effluents on plant
   production, drainage water composition and soil properties. Multiple
   lysimeters containing undisturbed soil cores were installed in an
   outdoor facility. Two soil types were investigated: Horotiu silt loam
   (Allophanic Soil) and Manawatu silt loam (Recent Soil). Effluents were
   applied onto the lysimeters fortnightly for 2 years at a nitrogen
   loading rate of about 600 kg N ha(-1) per year, giving different
   hydraulic loading rates for the two effluents. Equivalent volumes of
   water were applied to control lysimeters. Plant production in all the
   lysimeters to which effluents were applied increased considerably, and
   the increases were similar on both soils. Plant materials ``cut and
   carried{''} accounted for the removal of large amounts of the nutrients
   applied in the effluents. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the
   drainage water from both the control and the effluent-treated lysimeters
   were low (< 1 g NO3- -N m(-3) and < 1 g P m(-3)). Measurements of total
   soil nitrogen did not show any increase in nitrogen content. There was
   an indication of phosphorus accumulation in the Horotiu surface soil
   with the application of the N-reduced effluent. Application of both
   effluents increased the leaching losses of cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+ and
   Mg2+). The N-reduced effluent had a more profound effect on the
   concentrations of cations in the drainage water than the primary-treated
   effluent. This was due to the higher total loading of cations in the
   N-reduced effluent. After the application of both effluents, total
   amounts of cations in the drainage water were generally in the order:
   Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ for both soils, while the amounts of cations in
   the effluents applied were in the order: Na+ > K+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+. For the
   effluent-treated lysimeters, Ca2+ loss in the drainage water was up to
   twice that applied in the effluent, whereas < 40\% of the total Na+
   applied in the effluent was recovered in the drainage water. After the
   application of the effluents, soil exchangeable Na+ and K+ in both soils
   increased significantly. However, there was a decreasing trend in soil
   exchangeable Ca2+ and Mg2+. It is concluded that application of meat
   processing effluents can increase plant production due to increased
   nutrient loadings. In the long term, however, the changes in soil
   exchangeable cations may affect soil quality and the sustainability of
   plant production, and could be a problem for sustainability of effluent
   application. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Much research has been undertaken that seeks to understand the crop
   productivity response to soil erosion. Reported effects appear to be
   inconsistent with respect to both the magnitude of the response and
   shape of the response curve. This study was conducted to examine whether
   general patterns emerge when the results of experimental studies on soil
   loss are combined and compared.
   Results from a number of studies that relate crop productivity to
   erosion were collected and quantified. Important variables of a
   methodological or physical nature were identified. Both the magnitude
   and shape of the response curves were related to these variables.
   It appears that the experimental methodology has an overwhelming effect
   on the magnitude of the crop productivity response to soil erosion. The
   comparative-plot method showed an average reduction in crop productivity
   of 4.3\% per 10 cm of soil loss, whereas the reduction averaged 10.9\%
   for studies based on the transect method and 26.6\% for desurfacing
   experiments. Physical variables affected the shape of the response
   curve: water deficit and physical root hindrance produced convex curves,
   whereas nutrient deficit resulted in linear to concave curves. The
   available data did not allow identification of any significant effect of
   the physical variables on the magnitude of the response, nor an effect
   of the research-method on the shape of the response curve.
   It is assumed that the desurfacing and transect methods overestimate the
   effect of soil erosion because (a) desurfacing experiments result in
   much stronger changes in soil properties than soil erosion that takes
   place gradually, and (b) transect methods often ``include{''} effects of
   other processes that are related to topography. If this assumption is
   correct, then yield reductions of approximately 4\% per 10 cm of soil
   loss should be considered realistic. Where nutrient deficits are avoided
   by fertilization, response curves are generally convex, implying that
   reductions will become increasingly severe with further erosion. (C)

Abstract = {{The DNPK trial was started at Samaru in 1950 to assess the nutrient
   imbalances resulting from the increasing use of mineral fertilizers on
   some poorly buffered soils, improve and optimize productivity of these
   soils under intensive agricultural land use. Aggregation, trace, and
   heavy metals enrichment were studied in some selected plots under this
   trial, with a view to identify treatment(s) that best improve soil
   quality over a long-term period. Soils under treatments involving sole
   cowdung (D), cowdung + phosphorus (DP) fertilizer, and cowdung +
   nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (DNPK) fertilizers recorded higher
   mean weight diameter, lower soil bulk density, and higher percentage of
   aggregates greater than 1-mm diameter. Hence, these three treatments are
   better aggregated to withstand wind erosion. However, the DNPK treatment
   was the only one, which consistently, recorded lower trace and heavy
   metals content.}},

Abstract = {{The fertilizer intensive technology so long promoted in agriculture
   produced a green revolution but has brought long-term damages to soil
   quality. The technology now appears unsustainable for future
   agricultural development in India both on account of its ecological
   implications and the burden on the budget. There is now a need to
   revisit the traditional methods once used in agriculture and to look for
   a judicious blend of chemical fertilizer based technology with organic
   manure.
   Since manures are relatively less productive in the short run there is
   an alarm that a shift in technology away from the chemical fertilizer
   towards organic manure may mean a compromise in production or may hurt
   the incomes of farmers. This paper emphasizes the environmental benefits
   of a possible shift in agricultural technology, while keeping in view
   the importance of sustaining crop yield levels and protecting farmers'
   incomes. Considering two major crops in India in specific states the
   paper finds that over time while fertilizer use intensified several
   times over, the use of manure in agriculture either stagnated or
   declined. The manure market remained localized, limited and unorganized
   and its price was significantly higher than fertilizer in terms of
   nutrients in contrast to the organized and state supported fertilizer
   market. The paper estimates quadratic yield functions based on
   cross-section household level data and using the prices faced by farmers
   as reported by official survey finds that in majority of the cases there
   will not be any financial loss resulting from a small shift in
   technology towards organic manure. Such a shift can however be
   considered feasible if the losing households are compensated and if
   manure price is kept in control by promoting a more dynamic manure
   market. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to see the effect of arsenic contamination on soil
   quality indicators, viz., microbial biomass, soil respiration,
   fluorescein diacetate and dehydrogenase (DHG) activity in arsenic
   contaminated soils of West Bengal. All the parameters were significantly
   and negatively correlated with all the form of arsenic (bioavailable and
   total) but the microbial metabolic quotient was significantly and
   positively correlated with all forms of arsenic, indicating arsenic
   induced stress to the sod microbial community. This may be due to pan of
   the microbial biomass, which is located in the inner parts of the
   micro-aggregates of soil. which is affected by arsenic accumulates
   present in soil particles. Linear regression analysis revealed that the
   bioavailable arsenic exerted greater inhibitory effect on the sod
   microbial population than the total arsenic content of soils.
   Water-soluble arsenic showed more inhibitory effect than NaHCO3
   extractable form. in their association with biological properties of the
   contaminated soils. Water-soluble form of arsenic was much more toxic
   than insoluble forms. This signified that with increase in
   bioavailability, the arsenic exerted more inhibitory effect on these
   parameters. It is thus suggested that the microbial biomass, fluorescein
   diacetate and dehydrogenase activity alone and expressed on a soil
   organic matter basis along with the soil respiration parameters can be
   helpful in assessing the effects of arsenic on the size and activity of
   microbial biomass in soils. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing human population is placing greater demand on soil
   resources, and as a result degradation is taking place in many regions
   of the world. This is critical because soils perform a number of
   essential processes including supporting food and fiber production,
   influencing air quality through interaction with the atmosphere, and
   serving as a medium for storage and purification of water. The soil
   quality concept was introduced to complement soil science research by
   making our understanding of soils more complete and helping guide the
   use and allocation of labor, energy, fiscal, and other inputs as
   agriculture intensifies and expands to meet increasing world demands.
   Soil quality thus provides a unifying concept for educating
   professionals, producers, and the public about the important processes
   that soils perform. It also provides an assessment tool for evaluating
   current management practices and comparing alternative management
   practices. Soil attributes comprising a minimum data set have been
   identified, and both laboratory and field methods have been developed
   for measuring them. A soil quality index is being developed to normalize
   measured soil quality indicator data and generate a numeric value that
   can be used to compare various management practices or to assess
   management-induced changes over time. Using previously published data,
   we evaluated the soil quality index as a tool to assess a wide range of
   management practices in the Northern Great Plains. The index ranked the
   treatments: grazed fertilized tame pasture > moderately grazed >
   ungrazed > heavily grazed > annual cropping with no-tillage >
   conventionally tilled crop-fallow which agrees with the way they were
   subjectively ranked in the publications. The soil quality index shows
   potential for use as a management assessment tool.}},

Abstract = {{A survey was done in 15 typical villages, 150 soil and 86 vegetable
   plant samples were taken in Jiaxin prefecture of the Taihu Lake region,
   northern Zhejian province. Results indicate that after 15-20 years land
   use changed from the paddy rice-wheat (or oilseed rape) double cropping
   system, to a continuous vegetable land has caused soil quality dramatic
   change. (1) Acidification: average soil pH was 5.4; about 61\% of total
   samples were pH < 5.5. It was 0.9 units lower than 10 years ago with
   same upland vegetable cultivation and was 1.2 units lower than soil pH
   of paddy rice-wheat (or oilseed rape) rotation. (2) Fertilizer salt
   accumulation: the average salt content was 0.28\%, among these about
   36.2\% of the total samples contained more than 0.3\%. (3) Nitrate N and
   available phosphorus (P) over accumulation: on average it was 279 mg
   NO3-N/kg, and 45-115 mg P/kg. Nitrate N four times higher and available
   P 4-10 times more than it is in present paddy rice-wheat rotation soils
   respectively. This has caused wide concern because of possible
   groundwater and well drinking water pollution by leached nitrate N and
   the P losses to water by runoff from vegetable lands induce surface
   water eutrophication.}},

Abstract = {{Research on environmental pollution and degradation of soil and water
   resources is now of highest priority worldwide. To address these
   problems, soil physics should be conceived as a central core to this
   research. This paper objectives are to: (1) address the role and
   importance of soil physics, (2) demonstrate progress in this discipline,
   and (3) present various uses of soil physics in research, environment
   and industry. The study of dynamic processes at and within the soil
   vadose zone (flow, dispersion, transport, sedimentation, etc.), and
   ephemeral phenomena (deformation, compaction, etc.), form an area of
   particular interest in soil physics. Soil physics has changed
   considerably over time. These changes are due to needed precision in
   data collection for accurate interpretation of space and time variation
   of soil properties. Soil physics interacts with other disciplines and
   sciences such as hydro(geo)logy, agronomy, environment,
   micro-meteorology, pedology, mathematics, physics, water sciences, etc.
   These interactions prompted the emergence of advanced theories and
   comprehensive mechanisms of most natural processes, development of new
   mathematical tools (modeling and computer simulation, fractals,
   geostatistics, transformations), creation of high precision
   instrumentation (computer assisted, less time constraint, increased
   number of measured parameters) and the scale sharpening of physical
   measurements which ranges from micro to watershed. The environment
   industry has contributed to an enlargement of many facets of soil
   physics. In other words. research demand in soil physics has increased
   considerably to satisfy specific and environmental problems
   (contamination of water resources, global warming, etc.). Soil physics
   research is still at an embryonic stage in Morocco. Consequently, soil
   physicists can take advantage of developments occurring overseas, and
   need to build up a database of soil static and dynamic properties and to
   revise developed models to meet our conditions. Large, but special,
   investment is required to promote research programs in soil physics,
   which consider developments in this discipline and respect Moroccan
   needs. These programs will be highlighted herein. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Morocco's semi-arid lands are characterized by unique challenges. The
   most important obstacles to the development of durable agriculture are
   (1) limited and unpredictable supply of soil moisture and (2) low soil
   quality. Intensive use of soil throughout history has led to depletion
   in soil quality, leading in return to reduced yields because of the
   consequent reduced organic matter. Recognizing the need to recover soil
   quality and production decline, INRA scientists began, in the early
   1980s, research on the effects of crop rotations, tillage a id residue
   management on the productivity and quality of cropped soils. The present
   study concerns the short-term effect of rotation, tillage and residue
   management on selected quality indices of a calcixeroll (organic matter,
   nitrogen, particulate organic carbon (Cpom), particulate organic
   nitrogen (Npom) and pH). Hence, three rotations (wheat-wheat, WW;
   fallow-wheat. FW: and fallow-wheat-barley, FWB), two tillage systems
   (conventional offset disking, CT and no-tillage, NT), and three levels
   of residue in the NT system (NTo = no-residue cover, NT50 = half surface
   residue cover, NT100 = full surface residue cover) were selected. Three
   surface horizons were sampled (0-2.5, 2.5-7 and 7-20cm). The study
   results showed an improvement of measured soil chemical properties under
   NT compared to CT, at the surface layer. No-tillage system helped
   sequestration of carbon and nitrogen, build-up of particulate organic
   carbon and nitrogen and sensible reduction of pH only at the surface
   layer. Continuous wheat permitted a slight improvement of soil quality,
   mainly at the 0-2.5cm depth. Effects of rotation, tillage and residue
   level were reduced with depth of measurements. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Spatial variability of soil quality indicators was estimated in two
   studies to help plan sampling strategies. In the first study, spatial
   dependence of six soil quality indicators was measured for one soil
   order and one land use. Variation was measured between samples at 5 -,
   30-, and 100-m spacings, and between fields in Allophanic soils under
   pasture, to estimate the effect of sample spacing on the spatial
   variability of pH, total volumetric C and total volumetric N, C:N ratio,
   Olsen P, and mineralisable N. The second study tested the effects of
   land use and soil type on variation between samples at spacings less
   than 29 m at 65 sites. This second study also included base saturation,
   cation exchange capacity, bulk density, total porosity, and
   macroporosity in addition to the indicators of the first study. All
   samples were taken from the soil surface to 10 cm depth. Results of the
   first study in Allophanic soils suggested sample replication spacings of
   5 m or more for pH, 30 m or more for Olsen P, and mineralisable N, and
   100 m or more for total C,. total N, and C:N ratio. Sampling at less
   than these intervals will display some degree of autocorrelation and
   will less efficiently represent variation in the management unit being
   sampled. Results of the second indicated no significant effect of soil
   order on coefficient of variation, but land use did have an effect, with
   cropping having the lowest coefficient of variation followed by pasture,
   exotic forest, and native forest.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to quantify soil microbial biomass carbon in a
   soybean crop under different soil management systems: no-tillage, single
   harrowing, subsoiling and two harrowing, on a clay Red-Yellow Latossol
   in the Cerrado region. Soils were studied at five depths: 0-5, 5-10,
   10-20, 20-30 and 30-40 cm. Four periods were observed: before soil
   preparation; 30 days after germination; flowering stage and after
   harvesting soybean plants. The same measurements were taken under the
   same conditions in an area of native cerrado vegetation, adjacent to the
   experiment (Cerrado sensu strictu). Subsoiling showed highest carbon
   values 30 days after germination (865.7 mg kg(-1) of soil). This was
   reduced to less than 10\% (80.3 mg kg(-1)) at flowering. The carbon
   values were more stable in the no-tillage system, mainly in the 0-20 cm
   layer. The layers 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm showed significantly higher carbon
   values compared with other layers in most of the studied periods and
   depths. Subsoiling showed the lowest soil organic carbon level after
   soybean harvesting. Only in the system with subsoiling there was no
   significant correlation between the microbial carbon:organic carbon
   index and soil nutrients.}},

Abstract = {{Based on citizen demand, Iowa State University (ISU) established the
   first organic specialist faculty position at a US land grant university
   in 1997, as a shared appointment in the departments of horticulture and
   agronomy, with a 70\% extension and 30\% research split. By 1999, a
   national survey determined that ISU had reached the upper percentile of
   organic research, extension and educational activities at land grant
   universities in the US. This result was attributed to a series of
   successful Organic Agriculture Focus Groups in 1998, convened to help
   direct the new organic research and extension program at ISU.
   Partnerships with the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture and the
   College of Agriculture facilitated the ISU sustainable agriculture
   extension leader and organic specialist's participation in an extensive
   focus group dialogue with a diverse group of farmers (organic and
   conventional), agribusiness professionals, bankers and consumers in six
   agricultural communities across Iowa. Focus group responses included the
   need for organic research at the university level, since the majority of
   organic farmers (65\%) were receiving their information from other
   organic farmers and non-governmental publications. Paramount in the
   needs assessment was the establishment of organic research sites across
   the state to demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits
   associated with organic farming practices over the long term. Specific
   outcomes-based extension needs were articulated, which led to the
   development of an annual schedule of organic workshops, field days and
   conferences. In 2001, in a survey of 300 farmers to assess the outcomes
   of the Organic Agriculture Program, all respondents (39\% return rate)
   reported benefiting from an extension organic program. Similar to focus
   group results, farmers rated workshops and field days as the most likely
   venue for information dissemination. AS a result of organic farming
   practices, 90\% of respondents reported an increase in soil quality and
   67\% reported a 6-30\% increase in farm income. The success of land
   grant university organic programs will be dependent upon administrative
   support, sufficient resources and community involvement in the
   decision-making process.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an account of soil quality parameters and maize (Zea
   mays L. cv. Tundra) yields as influenced by the application of a
   by-product of two-step olive oil mill process (BOM). Such information is
   desirable for finding out the suitability of renewable energy resources
   such as by-products of different industries as alternatives to synthetic
   fertilizers and amendments. For this purpose, the main objective of this
   work was to study in the field the effect of incorporating BOM on soil
   properties (chemical, physical, and biological) in the period between
   two maize crops. The second objective was to study the effect of BOM on
   the productivity and quality of maize crop and to evaluate the utility
   of the BOM for maize. A by-product of two-step olive oil mill process
   was applied at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 t ha(-1) rates, respectively, on a
   maize crop in Lora del Rio (Andalusia, Spain) for 2 yr. The results
   indicated that BOM has a great soil amendment potential due to its
   organic matter and nutrient content. The application of BOM to the soil
   caused an increase in soil chemical, physical, and biological
   properties. Mineralization of organic matter produced higher contents of
   NO3--N in soil and increased NO3--N uptake by plants. Yield parameters
   of the second experimental season were better than those of the first
   experimental season due to the residual effect of the organic matter
   after application in the first season. In fact, application of the BOM
   gave a significant grain gross protein content of about 18 and 20\% for
   each experimental season, a significant grain soluble carbohydrate
   content of about 25\% for both experimental seasons, a significant
   number of grains per corncob of about 17 and 21\% for each experimental
   season, and a significant maize yield of about 16 and 18\% for each
   experimental season over the control.}},

Abstract = {{This work assessed soil bacterial diversity through community-level
   physiological profiles (CLPP) over three consecutive years, at sites
   representing a gradient of land use intensification. The relationship
   between CLPP and soil physical and chemical properties, and the
   potential use of CLPP for soil quality monitoring was also evaluated.
   Samples were collected from sites under native vegetation (V0);
   naturalized prairie, cleared in 1982 (P16); conventional tillage,
   cleared in 1972 (T26); and direct drilling, cleared in 1958 (D40). Plate
   counts were performed to determine soil culturable bacterial density.
   Sample dilutions were inoculated on Biolog GN microplates, and optical
   density (OD) was recorded after 54 h of incubation. Richness (Ri),
   Shannon-Weaver index (H) and principal component analysis (PCA) on OD
   standardized data were performed. Soil aggregation evaluated through the
   variation between dry and wet average aggregate diameter (DeltaAAD),
   soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were determined.
   Richness and H differed significantly among the sites. Principal
   component analysis consistently differentiated the soils in all 3 years.
   The P16 site did not differ in DeltaAAD from VO and T26, while SOC and
   TN did not differentiate T26 from D40. Results showed a lower
   sensitivity of physical and chemical variables than CLPP to detect
   differences along the land use intensification gradient. Multiple
   correlations between Ri and H with DeltaAAD, SOC and TN (R
   >\textbackslash{}0.70\textbackslash{}), suggested a high association
   between the soil aggregation condition and organic matter content with
   microbial diversity. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   carbon: Influences of water-filled pore space and red clover addition
   and relationships with microbial biomass carbon. Can. J. Soil Sci.
   84:151-158. Soil dissolved organic carbon (SDOC) plays an important role
   in organic C cycling and translocation of nutrients and pollutants in
   the soil profile. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) has been used as an
   indicator of soil quality. Both SDOC and MBC may be affected by
   management practices and indigenous soil properties, which however are
   not fully understood. Using a laboratory incubation technique, we
   determined the effects of red clover (Trifolium pratense L) addition and
   soil water saturation as expressed in water-filled pore space (WFPS,
   20-95\%) on soil SDOC and MBC in three soils from Ontario. The levels of
   SDOC were the greatest at 20\% WFPS, and decreased with increases in
   WFPS up to 95\%. In comparison with the control, addition of red clover
   increased SDOC by up to 72\% at 20\% WFPS, but the effect was minimal or
   insignificant at WFPS above 50\%. Reduction of SDOC with increases of
   WFPS both with and without red clover was attributed to the increased
   mineralization of labile organic C, as indicated by CO(2) production.
   Regardless of the legume amendment, soil available N (e.g., mineral N),
   labile organic C (e.g. initial level of SDOC) or the variable derived
   from these two measurements, available C:N ratio, were the factors
   predominately affecting dynamics of SDOC at WPFS from 20 to 50\% after
   1-mo incubation and at WFPS from 20 to 65\% with extended incubation to
   3-mo. Soil factors affecting SDOC at WFPS above 85\% were total N and pH
   without red clover, but changed to organic C and soil labile organic C
   with red clover. High levels of MBC were found to occur mostly with the
   high WFPS, and were enhanced by red clover addition only in the Perth
   silt loam. Soil dissolved organic C was significantly related to MBC
   with WFPS from 20 to 65\% without red clover. No relationships between
   SDOC and MBC were found at WFPS above 65\% without red clover and at
   WFPS from 20 to 95\%, with red clover. Soil factors affecting SDOC and
   the availability of SDOC to microbial activity are WFPS dependent and
   related to soil legume amendment.}},

Abstract = {{Carter, M, R., Sanderson, J. B. and MacLeod, J. A. 2004. Influence of
   compost on the physical properties and organic matter fractions of a
   fine sandy loam throughout the cycle of a potato rotation. Can. J. Soil
   Sci. 84: 211-218. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) rotations often require
   organic amendments to maintain or improve soil organic matter levels and
   soil physical properties. However, beneficial effects of compost can be
   modified by time of application and rotating tillage depth and
   intensity. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of compost
   applied once at different phases in a 3-yr potato, barley (Hordeum
   vulgare L.), and red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) rotation on a range
   of soil physical properties and organic matter fractions for a
   Charlottetown fine sandy loam (Orthic Humo-Ferric Podzol) in Prince
   Edward Island. Soil samples (0-9 cm) were obtained during the second
   cycle of the rotation (after two compost applications) in the fifth year
   of the experiment. Soil properties were influenced by compost addition,
   time of compost addition, and crop phase. Compost-induced benefits in
   soil physical properties (bulk density, macro-porosity, oxygen diffusion
   rate, shear vane strength, water-filled pore space) were mainly
   expressed in the red clover phase of the rotation, where soil density
   was relatively high compared to the barley and potato phases, due to the
   absence of tillage. The soil physical parameters, however, were mainly
   within their established optimum ranges for this soil type. Soil water
   content at -0.033 MPa was increased by compost in the potato phase,
   compared to the control. Soil organic matter was influenced by both
   compost and crop C inputs. Compost increased soil particulate organic
   matter (POM) in the potato and barley phases. Due to differences in crop
   residue inputs, compost-related differences in organic matter were
   minimized in the red clover phase of the rotation. Compost addition
   increased potato tuber yield above the maximum yield obtained with
   nitrogen application. This ``non-nitrogen{''} compost yield effect may
   be related to the slight, but significant, improvement in soil
   water-holding capacity. Overall, compost application in an intensive
   3-yr potato rotation provided benefits for potato productivity and in
   both soil physical and biological properties.}},

Abstract = {{A survey on current fertilizer practices and their effects on soil
   fertility and soil salinity was conducted from 1996 to 2000 in Beijing
   Province, a major vegetable production area in the North China Plain.
   Inputs of the major nutrients (NPK) and fertilizer application methods
   and sources for different vegetable species and field conditions were
   evaluated. Excessive N and P fertilizer application, often up to about 5
   times the crop requirement in the case of N, was very common, especially
   for high-value crops. Potassium supply may have been inadequate for some
   crops such as leafy vegetables. Urea, diammonium orthophosphate
   ((NH4)(2)HPO4) and chicken manure were the major nutrient sources for
   vegetable production in the region. Over 50\% of N, 60\% of P and nearly
   90\% of K applied originated from organic manure. Total N application
   rate for open-field Chinese cabbage from organic manure and inorganic
   fertilizers ranged from 300 to 900 kg N ha(-1) on 78\% of the farms
   surveyed. More than 35\% of the surveyed greenhouse-grown tomato crops
   received >1000 kg N ha(-1) from organic and inorganic sources. A
   negative K balance (applied K minus K removed by the crop) was found in
   two-thirds of the surveyed fields of open-field Chinese cabbage and half
   of the surveyed fields of greenhouse-grown tomato. Plant-available N, P
   and K increased with increasing length of the period the greenhouse
   soils had been used for vegetable production. Similarly, soil salinity
   increased more in greenhouse soils than in open-field soils. The results
   indicate that balanced NPK fertilizer use and maintenance of soil
   quality are important for the development of sustainable vegetable
   production systems in this region.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate alterations in the physical
   soil quality of a Dystroferric Red Latosol (Typic Haplorthox) caused by
   chiseling, after thirteen years of no-tillage. The experiment consisted
   of two management systems: soil chiseling down to a 0.30 m depth (NTC)
   and no-tillage (NT). Undisturbed soil samples were collected at depths
   of 0-0.15 m and 0.15-0.30 m, and the soil water retention curve, the
   soil resistance to penetration curve, the soil bulk density, and the
   ``Least Limiting Water Potential{''} (LLWP) were determined. The results
   showed that the chiseling caused modifications in soil porosity in the
   0-0.15 m layer, maintaining appropriate aeration conditions in water
   matric potentials under 0.01 MPa. On the other hand, the strongest
   limitations by soil penetration resistance in matric potentials under
   1.5 MPa were verified in the NTC soil management. In the 0.15-0.30 m
   soil layer under the NTC treatment, the soil penetration resistance was
   the upper limit of the LLWP. The results of the study indicate that
   under the present management condition, chiseling is not necessary in
   this soil.}},

Abstract = {{Our goal was to determine the effects of surface mining on forest land
   productivity in the eastern coalfields of the USA before the passage of
   the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), and to
   determine the extent to which selected mine soil properties influenced
   forest productivity. The site productivity of 14 mined and eight
   nonmined sites in the eastern and midwestern coalfields were compared.
   Results show that site productivity of nonmined sites and 12 of the 14
   mined sites was similar. Sites with low productivity were shallow, had
   high coarse fragment contents, and had lower fertility. Regression
   analysis identified five influential soil properties affecting site
   quality, which included soil profile base saturation (BS), total coarse
   fragments, total available water, C horizon total porosity, and soil
   profile electrical conductivity (EC). These five properties explained
   52\% of the variation in tree growth. Forests on most prelaw mined sites
   were just as productive as the forests on unmined adjacent sites and can
   be used as a benchmark to assess the impacts of current reclamation on
   mine soil quality and forest productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Few direct measurements are made to quantify the erosion from upstope to
   lower field boundaries by intensive tillage. We conducted 50 plowing
   operations over a 5-d period using a donkey-drawn mold-board-plow on
   steep backslope in the Chinese Loess Plateau. Topographic changes at
   different slope positions were quantified using differential global
   positioning system (DGPS). Soil organic matter (SOM), extractable P and
   N, and soil bulk density were measured along a downslope transect after
   each 10-tillage series. Fifty operations resulted in a decrease in
   maximum soil surface level (SSL) of 1.25 m in the upper slope position
   and an increase of 1.33 m at the bottom of the slope. Slope gradients
   decreased from 37 to 14degrees at the upper position and from 18 to
   0degrees at the lower position. Surface soil bulk density increased from
   1.14 to 1.28 Mg m(-1) in the upper slope and decreased from 1.10 to 1.03
   Mg m(-3) in the middle slope. Mean SOM concentrations in the upper and
   middle positions of the slope decreased from 8.3 to 3.6 g kg(-1),
   mineral N from 43.4 to 17.4 mg kg(-1), and Olsen-P from 4.5 to 1.0 mg
   kg(-1). Intensive tillage resulted in a short-term increase in SOM and
   available nutrients in the lower portion during the tillage operations.
   Geomorphologic evolution and landscape variability of dissected
   hillslopes are attributable to soil movement and resulting physical and
   fertility degradation induced by intensive tillage.}},

Abstract = {{Crop-pasture rotations (CPR) are unusual around the world but have been
   the predominant cropping system in Uruguay since the 1960s. Uruguay has
   a temperate sub-humid climate, 80\% of its landscape (16 Mha) is climax
   grasslands C-3 and C-4 species. Beef, wool, and dairy are the main
   commodities. Crops occupy a portion of the remaining 20\% land area,
   primarily on Argiudolls and Vertisols, rotated with seeded grass and
   legume pastures. Continuous cropping (CC) with conventional tillage (CT)
   has proven unsustainable due to decreased soil productivity. Seeded
   pasture periods increased soil productivity. CPR adoption created less
   variable inter-annual economic results, but soil degradation remained a
   major concern during the crop cycle using CT. Farmers and technicians
   became interested in no-till (NT) to reduce erosion and production cost.
   Currently, approximately 52\% of crop producing farms and 25\% of dairy
   farms have adopted NT. This paper synthesizes research results (mainly
   from long-term experiments) contrasting CC versus CPR with CT
   (1960-1990) and NT (from 1990). Soil erosion was reduced more than six
   times with NT in CC, and almost three times in CPR compared with CC
   using CT; but combining the use of CPR and NT resulted in the same low
   erosion rate as under natural pasture. The transition from CT to NT is
   not always easy. The time between herbicide application to pasture and
   planting of the first crop of the rotation crop cycle with NT is a
   critical transition factor to optimize N and water availability, and
   soil tilth. Chiseling or paraplowing can alleviate plow-pans inherited
   by NT from previous CT; but higher soil strength at the soil surface
   under NT contributes to better forage utilization under grazing. Soil
   organic carbon (SOC) content in CC decreased with CT, and was maintained
   with NT only if grain was harvested. In CC systems with harvested
   forage, SOC decreased even with NT. CPR with NT maintained or increased
   the original SOC content. The paper concludes with a discussion on the
   relative sustainability of CC versus CPR with NT. Both are sustainable
   from the soil quality and productivity standpoints. But compared with
   CC, CPR is a more economically and climatically buffered system, due to
   higher diversity. Also, CPR systems are more environmentally sustainable
   since fuel and agrochemicals usage is reduced approximately 50\%. (C)

Abstract = {{Conservation tillage has become a major soil management strategy to
   reduce soil erosion and improve soil quality, yet the impacts of crop
   rotation on soil responses to conservation tillage remain poorly
   described. We investigated the effects, of (i) perennial grass cover
   versus annual cropping and (ii) type of break crop in a wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L.)-based crop rotation system on surface-soil (0-10 cm)
   structural and organic matter properties towards the end of a decade of
   continuous management on an Albic Luvisol in the cold, semiarid region
   of northwestern Canada. Soil aggregation was at state to resist water
   erosion more under perennial grass (i.e. bromegrass (Bromus inermis
   Leyss.) and red fescue (Festuca rubra L.)) than under annual cropping
   systems (mean-weight diameter of 2.1 and 1.6 mm under perennial and
   annual systems, respectively). Soil organic C was higher (44 g C kg(-1)
   soil versus 38 g C kg(-1) soil), but total soil N was lower (3.5 g N
   kg(-1) soil versus 3.9 g N kg(-1) soil) under perennial compared with
   annual cropping systems. There were few significant differences in
   soil-structural properties among the various annual cropping systems.
   The largest effect was greater light-fraction C and N under continuous
   wheat(4.0 g C kg(-1) soil and 0.27 g N kg(-1) soil) compared with other
   rotations, especially wheat-wheat-tallow (2.4 g C kg-1 soil and 0.16 g N
   kg(-1) soil), as a result of higher residue inputs. Relationships
   between mean-weight diameter of water-stable aggregates and biochemical
   properties were strongest for soil microbial biomass C and soil organic
   C. Perennial grass cover exhibited greater potential to preserve
   soil-structural properties than no-tillage annual cropping. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{To evaluate the degradation of soil quality and find ways to maintain
   soil fertility on the Loess Plateau of China, the effects of cultivation
   time on total organic carbon (TOC), light fraction of organic carbon
   (LFOC), and microbial biomass carbon (NIB-C) in two soil chronosequences
   comprised of Huangmian (Calcaric Cambisols, FAO) and Huihe (Haplic
   Greyxems, FAO) soils were investigated. The effects of fertilization on
   the TOC and its fractions were also studied using samples from a
   long-term experiment on Heilu soil (Calcic Kastanozems, FAO). Upon
   cultivation, Huangmian soil (0-20 cm) lost 77\% of TOC within 5 years,
   at a reduction rate of 2.15 Mg C ha(-1) per year. The Huihe soil (0-20
   cm) lost 70\% of TOC at a rate of 0.96-1.06 Mg C ha(-1) per year over 42
   years. In the Huangmian soil, water and tillage erosion are likely the
   main reasons for organic carbon decline, while organic matter
   decomposition and water erosion appear to be dominant factors in the
   Huihe soil. The LFOC decreased by 73 and 90\% for the Huangmian and
   Huihe soil for the corresponding period. Changes in microbial biomass
   carbon (NIB-C) showed the same trend as TOC and LFOC. The results of the
   long-term experiment on the Heilu soil indicated that manure alone and
   manure plus nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer treatments restored TOC
   and MB-C to the level of the native sod, indicating the importance of
   manure addition in maintaining soil fertility over the long term (20
   years). The straw return plus nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer
   treatment had a significantly higher TOC than nitrogen plus phosphorus
   fertilizer alone. Organic matter additions in the form of manure or
   straw, either alone or in combination with chemical fertilizers, appears
   to be more effective in maintaining or restoring organic matter in Heilu
   soil on the Loess Plateau than chemical fertilizer alone. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Studies have shown that no-till (NT) management reduces soil erosion
   relative to chisel/disk-tillage (CT) and that this benefit may increase
   over time. There are fewer data, however to separate the
   erosion-reduction contributions of surface residue mulch from those of
   improved soil properties under NT The objective of this study was to
   quantify these separate contributions for a silt loam soil (Glossic
   Fragiudalf) used for corn (Zea mays L.) production in northern
   Mississippi for five to ten years with either CT or NT The experiment
   had ten treatments. Two were normal CT and NT managements in which a
   crop was planted but had not emerged prior to simulated rainfall. The
   other eight treatments had surface crop residues removed and comprised a
   2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of two tillage histories (CTh or NTh),
   two levels of tillage immediately prior to rainfall simulation
   (disturbed or not disturbed), and two levels of residue removal (residue
   removed just prior to simulated rainfall or residue removed one year
   prior to simulated rainfall). Simulated rainfall was applied at a rate
   of 65 mm h(-1) in a three-storm sequence on 10.7 x 3.7 m areas. NT
   exhibited greater runoff but much lower sediment losses than CT Residue
   removal doubled erosion for both tillage histories. Surface disturbance
   decreased runoff from the first storm following tillage but increased
   total soil loss 26\% to 47\%. With residues removed, long-term NTh
   resulted in one-third the soil loss of CTh, and similar benefits were
   observed with or without surface disturbance. This residual benefit of
   NTh was lost within one year of fallow after residue removal. These
   results demonstrate that the erosion resistance of NT areas is due to
   both residue cover and improved soil quality factors. Although the
   erosion-resisting soil quality factors developed over several years of
   NT management may be lost within a single year of fallow management,
   these factors may protect the soil from excessive erosion if NT fields
   that must occasionally be tilled are quickly returned to NT management.}},

Abstract = {{Producers in the semiarid Canadian prairies practice frequent summer
   fallow to conserve water and reduce the risk of crop failure, but this
   practice Promotes soil degradation. In contrast, annual cropping
   enhances soil quality but results in greater economic risk. We need to
   know what is the most suitable cropping frequency for this region. In
   1985, based on results of the first 18 yr of a long-term crop rotation
   experiment being conducted on a medium-textured, Orthic Brown Chernozem
   at Swift Current, Saskatchewan, we modified the experiment to allow
   comparison of four cropping frequencies over the period 1985-2002. These
   were fallow-spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (F-W), F-W-W,
   F-W-W-W-W-W, and continuous wheat (Cont W). All systems received
   recommended rates of N and P fertilizer. Growing season precipitation
   during the 1985-2002 period was 10\% above average so that grain yields
   were also above average for this region. We assessed yields of grain,
   straw and N in aboveground plant parts, N concentration in grain and
   straw, harvest index, nitrogen harvest index and water use efficiency,
   and the average annual production (on a rotation basis) of grain, straw
   and aboveground N yield, and related these characteristics to water
   deficit. Water deficit was the main factor responsible for annual
   variations in the characteristics assessed. Of these characteristics,
   cropping frequency influenced only the average annual productivity
   factors; it rarely influenced the characteristics when they were
   assessed on a rotation-phase basis. Assuming cropping frequency (x) for
   the 2-yr, 3-yr, 6-yr and Cont W rotations is 50\%, 67\%, 83\%, and
   100\%, respectively, then average annual yields (y) in kg ha(-1) yr(-1)
   were related to frequency as follows: (1) for grain yield y = 768 + 10.7
   x, r(2) = 0.99; (2) for straw yield y = 1159 + 18.9 x, r(2) = 0.99; and
   (3) for aboveground plant N yield y = 23.7 + 0.36 x, r(2) = 0.99. The
   regression between annual grain production and cropping frequency at
   Swift Current for 1985 to 2002 had a much higher slope than the
   relationship for the same experiment in the much drier 1967 to 1984
   period. Further, the equations for Swift Current in 1985-2002 were
   similar to the relationships obtained for systems in the subhumid Black
   Chernozems, indicating such relationships are greatly influenced by
   weather conditions. These relationships may be useful for conducting
   economic analyses and for modeling N balance. We conducted an apparent N
   balance analysis which indicated that all four rotations have lost N
   from the system in inverse proportion to the frequency of cropping.
   However, changes in total N in the 0- to 0.3-m depth of soil suggest
   that they have not lost N and that Cont W gained N over the course of
   the study. We are not able to explain this apparent anomaly and
   recommend further research on this question.}},

Abstract = {{Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to investigate the
   effects of herbicides on soil microbial C (microbial biomass), bacterial
   diversity and community structure. In the first greenhouse experiment,
   12 herbicides were applied at recommended rates to a Gray Luvisolic soil
   contained in trays. Soil samples were collected 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 wk
   after treatment and analysed for microbial C and bacterial diversity.
   The second greenhouse experiment was similar to the first, but only 6 of
   the 12 herbicides were applied to a Gray Luvisolic and Black Chernozemic
   soil. The same six herbicides were applied to the Gray Luvisolic soil at
   a field site near Fort Vermilion, Alberta, and to the Black Chernozemic
   soil at Lacombe, Alberta, in 2000. In the first greenhouse experiment,
   metribuzin, imazamox/imazethapyr, triasulfuron and metsulfuron methyl
   reduced microbial C compared with glufosinate ammonium and sethoxydim.
   In the second greenhouse experiment, microbial diversity as determined
   by Shannon index was lower after application of metribuzin,
   imazamox/imazethapyr and glufosinate ammonium than after application of
   glyphosate, but none of the herbicides altered microbial diversity
   relative to the control treatment. In the field experiments, herbicides
   had no effect on microbial C or diversity. In all experiments,
   examination of microbial community structure revealed herbicide-induced
   shifts in microbial composition even when diversity indices among
   treatments were not different. It was concluded that herbicides applied
   once at recommended rates did not have significant or consistent effects
   on microbial C or diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper deals with chemometric interpretation of soil analysis
   data collected from 31 sampling sites in the region of Kavala and Drama,
   Northern Greece. The determination of 16 different chemical and
   physicochemical characteristics is principally needed for prognosis of
   the land treatment and fertilizing. The study carried out indicates that
   the application of multivariate statistical approaches could reveal new
   and specific information about sampling sites. It has been found that
   they could be divided into four general patterns: pattern 1 contains
   dominantly inorganic and alkaline soil samples from semi-mountainous
   regions in close proximity to the seacoast; pattern 2 indicates the same
   soil sample type and regional location as pattern 1 but is far from the
   coastal line; pattern 3 includes samples from sites from the plains with
   organic and alkaline soils with close proximity to the coast; pattern 4
   resembles pattern 3 as soil type but involves samples from sites far
   from the shore. Further, six latent factors were identified,
   conditionally named ``structural{''}, ``acidic{''}, ``nutritional{''},
   ``salt{''}, ``microcomponents{''} and ``organic{''}. Finally, an
   apportioning procedure was carried out to find the source contributions
   in the measured analytical values. In this way the routine estimation of
   the soil quality could be improved. (C) Central European Science

Abstract = {{Wet and dry atmospheric depositions and soil chemical and
   microbiological properties were determined in a Mediterranean natural
   ecosystem of Central Italy near Rome (Castelporziano Estate). The
   monitoring of depositions permitted us to quantify the exceedances of S
   and N compounds (expressed as eq H(+) ha(-1) year(-1)) over the critical
   loads of acidity. Critical loads, i.e. the quantity of a substance which
   a part of the environment can tolerate without adverse effects
   occurring, were determined adopting the level 0 methodology following
   the UN/ECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution.
   Deposition data were available for the period 1992-1997, and acidity
   exceedances were referred to the main vegetation types present in the
   area. Results showed that most part of the Estate has a medium degree of
   vulnerability to acidification, and the corresponding risk of
   acidification deriving from the exceedances of atmospheric deposition
   was rather low. The study of soil chemical and microbiological
   properties included mainly total soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial
   biomass-C, biomass-C/SOC, soil respiration, and metabolic quotient
   (qCO(2)). Soil organic C metabolism has been discussed on the basis of
   the results from eight sampling sites. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to compare the influence of two different
   long-term organic fertilization regimes at an arable site on a
   nutrient-poor, sandy soil with respect to soil microbial biomass
   contents and microbial activities. The investigation was performed on a
   long-term experimental arable field site, located in the
   semi-continental climate of Central Europe (IOSDV, Berlin-Dahlem,
   Germany). Soil microbial biomass and dehydrogenase activity were most
   clearly increased by combined straw and green manure treatment. In
   comparison. farmyard manure had a weaker effect. explained by less
   frequent applications and different quality of organic materials
   incorporated into soil. The mineral N-fertilization did not
   significantly effect microbial biomass content or dehydrogenase activity
   of the soil under study. The cellulase activity was increased markedly
   by straw and green manure treatment. but was increased only slightly by
   mineral fertilization. Organic manuring with plant residues had a
   stronger impact on soil microbial activity as compared to different soil
   sampling dates. We conclude that soil microbial activity was governed
   most clearly by the fertilization regime under the conditions of the
   investigated field experiment. Furthermore, manuring with plant residues
   has the most beneficial effects on soil quality among the investigated
   types of fertilization. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term nutrient supply in forest ecosystems is due to the dissolution
   of primary and secondary minerals in soils. The potential of nutrient
   release in 19 forest soils in a cool humid climate was examined. The
   soil profiles are classified as Alfisols (10), Spodosols (2), Entisols
   (4), Ultisols (1), and Mollisols (2), thus covering a gradient in soil
   fertility. Short-term and long-term release of calcium, magnesium,
   potassium, phosphorus, and aluminum was evaluated by a batch extraction
   using dilute nitric acid (0.1 M) for 2 hours, followed by 2 days (48 h),
   and 7 days (168 h). The solution was renewed after 2 and 50 hours
   extraction time. Nutrient pools expressed as g m(-2) to soil depth 100
   cm, and a base index (Ca(2+)+ Mg(2+)+ K(+) (mol(c) m(-2)) : Ca(2+) +
   Mg(2+) + K(+) + Al(3+) (mol(c) m(-2))) were interpreted in relation to
   soil texture classes. Subsoil texture classes: Coarse: < 5\% clay;
   medium 5-10\% clay or (> 5\% silt or > 50\% fine sand), or fine > 10\%
   clay were evaluated as an indicator of forest soil quality. Base cation
   and phosphorus release decreased in the order fine > medium > coarse.
   Texture classes explained base cation release by about 80\% of total
   variation, and phosphorus release by 40-50\%. The base index generally
   increased by extraction time for sandy soils and decreased for loamy
   soils. This indicated that sandy soils released accumulated reactive
   aluminum in the 0-2 hour extraction. Subsoil texture class is suggested
   as a pedotransfer function for long-term nutrient release potential in
   Danish forest soils.}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater has been widely used for agricultural irrigation in China and
   countries in arid and semi-arid areas. Because of poor control of the
   wastewater quality and long-term application, pollutants accumulation
   and the relevant ecotoxicological effects may occur, especially for
   persistent pollutants and permanently bound chemical residues. The
   pollutants accumulated in soil may transfer through the food chains and
   cause negative effects on human health. In the present study, a field
   survey in farmlands that have been irrigated with effluents from a
   sewage treatment plant and untreated wastewater was carried out. The
   soil quality was evaluated using a battery of chemical and biological
   parameters to describe the integrated situations of the polluted sites.
   Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were quantified by GC - ECD and
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed by GC-MS with
   internal standard. Polyphenol oxidase and catalase activities were
   examined to investigate the soil functions. Vicia faba micronucleus test
   was performed to detect the potential genotoxicity of water extracts of
   the soils. It has been concluded that both PAHs and OCPs have
   accumulated in the soils irrigated with wastewater. The main origin of
   PAHs was from the wastewater discharged from a coal plant. The site
   close to the pollution discharge point was heavily polluted by PAHs.
   OCPs were mainly residues of historical agriculture application. The MN
   frequencies and the activity of polyphenol oxidase were positively
   correlated with PAHs concentrations but have no correlation with OCPs.
   Therefore, polyphenol oxidase activity and MN frequencies were suggested
   as the biological indicators of PAHs pollution.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing and widespread interest in the maintenance of soil
   quality and remediation strategies for management of soils contaminated
   with organic pollutants and trace metals or metalloids. There is also a
   growing body of evidence that arbuscular mycorrhizal ( AM) fungi can
   exert protective effects on host plants under conditions of soil metal
   contamination. Research has focused on the mechanisms involved and has
   raised the prospect of utilizing the mutualistic association in soil
   re-vegetation programmes. In this short paper we briefly review this
   research, summarize some recent work and highlight some new data which
   indicate that the alleviation of metal phytotoxicity, particularly Zn
   toxicity, by arbuscular mycorrhiza may occur by both direct and indirect
   mechanisms. Binding of metals in mycorrhizal structures and
   immobilization of metals in the mycorrhizosphere may contribute to the
   direct effects. Indirect effects may include the mycorrhizal
   contribution to balanced plant mineral nutrition, especially P
   nutrition, leading to increased plant growth and enhanced metal
   tolerance. Further research on the potential application of arbuscular
   mycorrhiza in the bioremediation or management of metal-contaminated
   soils is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In the middle terrace area of south Sumatra, Indonesia, where red acid
   soils poor in crop productivity are widely distributed, the effects of
   cropping pattern and cultivation techniques on physico-chemical
   properties of soil were investigated. Five patterns for cassava
   cropping, including monoculture, a rotation with annual food crops, and
   three intercroppings with differences in the combination with annual
   crops and in the planting density, were evaluated in Experiment I. In
   Experiment II, eight plots composed of the combinations of two tillage
   methods (no-tillage or conventional tillage), the presence or absence of
   surface mulch from crop residues, and two rates of chemical fertilizers
   were established for a maize-soybean-cowpea sequential cropping pattern.
   At the end of 3 years, there was no difference in total C and total N
   concentrations among the plots in Experiment I irrespective of the mulch
   treatment using crop residues. Soil organic matter (SOM) concentration
   was not affected even in the no-tillage plot where the maximum crop
   residues (20 t ha(-1)) was given as surface mulch with the increased
   root residues due to higher rates of fertilizers (Experiment II). In
   Experiment I, available P concentration was highest in an intercropping
   with higher fertilizer rates and lowest cassava planting density. In
   Experiment II, an increase in available P was attained by mulching and
   the higher rate of fertilizers, and a minor positive effect of
   fertilizer was also observed in exchangeable Mg and K concentrations.
   Surface mulch resulted in less clay fraction compared with the non-mulch
   plots in both the experiments, suggesting its effect on the maintenance
   of soil particle distribution. An additional finding suggested no
   prominent influence of cassava monoculture on the level of SOM in this
   area based on the comparison with other major land uses, including
   secondary forest, rubber plantation, and mixed cultivation of fruits
   with crops. Nevertheless, the introduction of crop residue mulch and
   higher rates of fertilizers are recommended for sustaining soil quality
   and achieving higher crop yields. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Reported increases in crop yields over the first few years of organic
   farming (especially during the 3-year ``transitional{''} period
   established in US law) have been attributed to gradual improvements in
   soil properties, such as the capacity of the soil microbial community to
   mineralize N or to suppress disease. To test the hypothesis that yield
   increases with years of organic farming are due to improvements in soil
   properties, we compared identically managed organic and transitional
   plots differing only in duration of organic management (>5 versus <1
   year). Conventional plots were included for reference purposes. There
   was no difference in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) growth or
   yield between established organic and first-year transitional plots, but
   both outperformed the comparable conventional system. Even no-compost
   subplots within the transitional plots had yields similar to established
   organic plots, so the yield advantage relative to conventional plots was
   apparently due to beneficial effects of a winter legume cover crop in a
   wet year. Soil inorganic N did not differ between transitional and
   organic plots. Conventional and organic plots differed in soil microbial
   community composition, but transitional plots were not intermediate
   between conventional and organic. In the second year of the organic
   transition, when maize (Zea mays L.) was grown, yields were again not
   significantly different from the established organic system. This result
   is inconsistent with the hypothesis that yield-limiting differences in
   soil quality between organic and conventional systems take at least 3
   years to develop. An alternative hypothesis, not tested directly, is
   that previously reported yield increases result from improved management
   with increasing experience, not improving soil quality. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Concern for the potential global change consequences of increasing
   atmospheric CO(2) has prompted interest in the development of mechanisms
   to reduce or stabilize atmospheric CO(2). During the next several
   decades, a program focused on terrestrial sequestration processes could
   make a significant contribution to abating CO(2) increases. The
   reclamation of degraded lands, such as mine-spoil sites, highway
   rights-of-way, and poorly managed lands, represents an opportunity to
   couple C sequestration with the use of fossil-fuel and energy
   by-products and other waste material, such as biosolids and organic
   wastes from human and animal sewage treatment facilities, to improve
   soil quality. Degraded lands are often characterized by acidic pH, low
   levels of key nutrients, poor soil structure, and limited
   moisture-retention capacity. Much is known about the methods to improve
   these soils, but the cost of implementation is often a limiting factor.
   However, the additional financial and environmental benefits of C
   sequestration may change the economics of land reclamation activities.
   The addition of energy-related by-products can address the adverse
   conditions of these degraded lands through a variety of mechanisms, such
   as enhancing plant growth and capturing of organic C in long-lived soil
   C pools. This review examines the use of fossil-fuel combustion
   by-products and organic amendments to enhance C sequestration and
   identifies the key gaps in information that still must be addressed
   before these methods can be implemented on an environmentally meaningful
   scale. (C) 2002 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was performed for evaluating the most suitable biochemical
   parameters to measure dynamics of substrate transformation during
   composting of the organic fraction derived from pre-selected urban
   wastes and wood bark mixture. Changes of chemical (organic C,
   hydrosoluble sugars, total and mineral N, humified fraction, volatile
   acids and phenolic compounds) and biochemical (microbial respiration,
   biomass C, qCO(2), dehydrogenase, catalase, urease activities, FDA, and
   BIF) parameters were monitored for 1 0 days. Limited changes in organic
   C, total nitrogen, and humification characteristics were observed during
   composting. Dehydrogenase and catalase activities, BIF and FDA showed
   small changes during composting. Urease activity and, with some
   limitations regarding the early stages of composting, microbial
   respiration and qCO(2), were found to be the most suitable parameters to
   measure dynamics of substrate transformation during composting of
   preselected urban wastes.}},

Abstract = {{Classical chemical fractionation of soil sulphur (S) into HI-reducible S
   and carbon-bonded S does not separate S in soil into fractions that have
   differing mineralization potentials. Other techniques are needed to
   separate organic S into more labile and less labile fractions of
   biological significance, irrespective of their bonding relations. We
   have sequentially fractionated soil S and carbon (C) into their ionic
   forms released onto ion-exchange resins and organic S and C extracted in
   alkali of increasing concentration. We evaluated the technique on
   pasture and arable soils that had received various fertilizer and
   cultivation treatments. Total S and C were greater in the soil of the
   fertilized pasture than in that of the unfertilized pastures. Continuous
   arable cropping decreased total soil S and C, whereas restoration to
   pasture caused an accumulation.
   Resin, 0.1 M NaOH, 1 M NaOH and residual fractions accounted for between
   1-13\%, 49-69\%, 4-16\% and 19-38\% of total soil S and between 5-6\%,
   38-48\%, 5-7\% and 46-53\% of total soil C, respectively. Among
   different S and C fractions, the size of the 0.1 M NaOH and residual
   fractions changed more with the change in land use and management. The
   0.1 M NaOH fraction had a narrower C:S ratio (50-75:1) than did the
   residual fraction (96-141:1). The significant degree of change in these
   two fractions, caused by differences in land management, indicates that
   they may be useful indicators of change in `soil quality'.}},

Abstract = {{Potential risks for human health and adverse effects on soil quality
   caused by accumulation of cadmium (Cd) in soil at concentrations around
   or exceeding current European Union (EU) permitted limits have long been
   recognized. We have assessed availability and partitioning of Cd in a
   Mediterranean calcareous soil under four management regimes. Cadmium was
   added as a single pulse of CdSO4 at the maximum Cd concentration
   established by the EU for sludge-amended agricultural soils and
   concentrations exceeding the mandatory limits. Soils were treated with
   0, 3, 10 and 50 mg Cd kg(-1) soil, incubated moist and analysed at
   selected times up to 600 days. Cadmium availability and distribution in
   soil were studied by neutral electrolyte and sequential extractions.
   During the incubation, the availability of Cd was not strictly dependent
   on the amount of metal added as the exchangeable fractions were similar
   shortly after the additions of Cd regardless of its initial
   concentration. Sequential extractions showed that for concentrations of
   3 and 10 mg Cd kg(-1) soil Cd was evenly distributed among the soil
   phases, and its mobility was reduced mainly by adsorption on carbonates.
   At Cd concentrations exceeding 10 mg Cd kg(-1) soil a residual fraction
   appeared, perhaps from precipitation of Cd. Most of the Cd was
   associated with carbonates; land management and organic matter content
   had no major effects on the Cd distribution among different soil phases.
   The extraction protocols were effective for studying the fate of Cd in
   this calcareous soil as almost all of the Cd added was recovered.
   However, the introduction of a preliminary step with buffered NH4NO3
   improved the determination of the most labile pools. Availability of Cd
   in calcareous soils estimated with reference methods appeared to be very
   small even when its total concentration far exceeded the current EU
   limits.}},

Abstract = {{Vertisols are among the major high potential soils in the central
   highlands of Ethiopia. Their productivity is constrained by severe
   waterlogging. Under traditional management systems, yield from these
   soils is far below the potential. To bridge the gap, several surface
   drainage methods were introduced and have shown a yield advantage over
   some of the traditional methods. However, alternative technologies for
   better crop yield and improved land resources management are still
   needed for sustainable use of the soils and water resources. As part of
   a concerted effort to improve productivity, field experiments were
   conducted during the 1996 and 1997 at Gincii, and 19982000 growing
   seasons at Caffee Doonsaa. Three land preparation methods, broad bed and
   furrows (BBF), ridge and furrows (RF) and flat seedbeds (FL) for the
   former, and four alternatives, BBF, RF, reduced tillage (RT) and green
   manuring (GM) for the latter, were evaluated. A randomized complete
   block design (RCBD) was used with three replications on permanent plots.
   Surface runoff and crops yields were considered as indicators of the
   efficiency of the land preparation methods. BBF gave the highest runoff
   at both locations over the years, but the effects on crop yields were
   inconsistent at both locations. BBF gave the lowest and the highest
   grain and straw yields in the first and the second years, respectively,
   at Gincii. GM and RT for cereals and BBF for a legume have shown better
   yield advantage at Caffee Doonsaa. To arrive at reliable conclusions, it
   is recommended that the experiment be continued under the prevailing
   cropping systems, taking soil quality and other sustainability
   indicators into account. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

   were much more effective, particularly turnips and seed drills.
   Environmental factors are incorporated into the model. Climate is shown

Abstract = {{The understanding and quantification of the impact caused by soil use
   and management on the physical soil quality are fundamental for the
   development of sustainable agricultural systems. The objective of this
   research was to quantify sonic physical soil properties to evaluate the
   physical quality of a dystrophic Red Latosol (Rhodic Ferralsol) in the
   northwest of the State of Parana, Brazil. Undisturbed soil samples were
   collected from two contiguous areas on an Experimental Farm of the State
   University of Maringa. One area was cultivated with annual crops under
   conventional tillage (disk plow and harrowing) and the other under
   native forest (semidecidual seasonal forest). The evaluated physical
   soil attributes were soil porosity and bulk density, soil water
   retention curve, soil resistance curve, and the least limiting water
   range. Results indicated significantly higher values of bulk density and
   lower values of soil porosity in the cultivated area. The soil water
   retention curve was not influenced by the soil use system, but was
   negatively influenced by bulk density. The soil resistance curve was
   influenced by the soil use system, evidenced by high values of soil
   resistance to root penetration under increasing drought in the
   cultivated soil. The least limiting water range was significantly
   smaller in the cultivated soil owing to the soil resistance to root
   penetration and air-filled porosity, which determined the lower and
   upper limits of soil water availability with bulk density increase. In.
   the soil under native forest, the least limiting water range was equal
   to the water availability determined by the field capacity and the
   permanent wilting point. Soil compaction in the cultivated soil induced
   changes in the soil porous system, which were described by lower values
   of the least limiting water range than in virgin soil.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term impact of tillage and residue management on soil
   microorganisms was studied over the growing season in a sandy loam to
   loamy sand soil of southwestern Quebec, growing maize (Zea mays L.)
   monoculture. Tillage and residue treatments were first imposed on plots
   in fall 1991. Treatments consisted of no till, reduced tillage, and
   conventional tillage with crop residues either removed from (-R) or
   retained on (+R) experimental plots, laid out in a randomized complete
   block design. Soil microbial biomass carbon (SMB-C), soil microbial
   biomass nitrogen (SMB-N) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) contents
   were measured four times, at two depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm), over the
   2001 growing season. Sample times were: May 7 (preplanting), June 25,
   July 16, and September 29 (prior to corn harvest). The effect of time
   was of a greater magnitude than those attributed to tillage or residue
   treatments. While SMB-C showed little seasonal change (160 mug C g(-1)
   soil), SMB-N was responsive to post-emergence mineral nitrogen
   fertilization, and PLFA analysis showed an increase in fungi and total
   PLFA throughout the season. PLFA profiles showed better distinction
   between sampling time and depth, than between treatments. The effect of
   residue was more pronounced than that of tillage, with increased SMB-C
   and SMB-N (61 and 96\%) in +R plots compared to -R plots. This study
   illustrated that measuring soil quality based on soil microbial
   components must take into account seasonal changes in soil physical and
   chemical conditions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of soil quality indicators (SQI) is important to
   sustainable management of natural resources. The objective of this
   project was to develop a technique for identifying SQIs for agricultural
   land use. Soil structure, water retention and transmission properties,
   and pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured and related to
   agronomic productivity for five land use and soil management treatments
   at the experimental farm of the North Appalachian Experimental
   Watersheds, Coshocton, Ohio. The five treatments were no-till corn
   without manure (NTWM), no-till corn with manure (NTM), no-till corn (Zea
   mays)-soybean (Glycine max) rotation (NTCSR), conventional tillage corn
   (CT), and meadow (M). Soil properties measured were bulk density
   (rho(b)), drainable porosity (f(a)), available water capacity (AWC),
   steady state infiltration rate (i(c)), saturated hydraulic conductivity
   (K-s), soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, water stable aggregation
   (WSA), mean weight diameter of aggregates (MWD), and texture. The
   correlation analysis on the measured soil attributes reduced the number
   of key variables from 17 to 11. A rating index on a 1 to 5 scale was
   obtained for each of the key soil properties. The linear regression
   analysis was first performed with key soil attributes as independent
   variables and biomass or grain yields as dependent variables, with the
   rating factor later assigned to each measured key soil attribute. The
   multiple regression analysis showed that SOC and WSA explained more than
   35\% of variability in biomass and 33\% in grain yields, respectively,
   and were identified as the major SQIs. Other important SQIs were rho(b),
   AWC, MWD, pH, and EC. The cumulative sustainability ratings (CR) for
   each land use showed that NTM was the most sustainable soil management
   treatment (CR = 20) and CT the least sustainable (CR = 30). The CR was
   also correlated significantly with grain yield (R-2 = 0.31, P < 0.002).
   The CR for different land uses suggests that soil management with NTM is
   the most sustainable and CT the least.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the question of how scientific information can
   improve local agronomic management using concepts of uncertainty
   classification and uncertainty management. Information and data on local
   management of soil fertility based on a local classification system of
   soil quality were collected from a small watershed in Cauca (Colombia).
   The analyses suggest that farmers hold local knowledge about soils at
   two levels. The first is based on empirical observations and refers to
   local knowledge about soils and landscape, which shows that the classes
   identified in the local soil quality classification are consistent with
   results obtained using measured soil parameters. At the second level,
   farmers have some awareness of ecological processes and the appropriate
   use of relationships between key soil characteristics and management
   options. It is argued that local knowledge is not sufficient to cope
   with uncertainty introduced by a rapidly changing agriculture,
   including, for example, increasing land pressure, unpredictable market
   forces and climate change. We have suggested how scientific knowledge
   can contribute to the solution, based on an analysis that relates
   Cohen's (Heuristic reasoning about uncertainty: an artificial
   intelligence approach. Pitman London, 1985) and Rowe's (Risk Analysis
   14, 743-750, 1994) uncertainty concepts to local knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{trials of vegetation modification were carried out to test the
   hypothesis that the management of key plant groups such as trees,

   short-term fallows. Soil properties and plant production during a 4-year
   fallow period and millet yields after clearing were recorded at two
   sites representing dry and subhumid climates in Senegal, West Africa.
   During the four years of fallow, soil organic matter did not vary
   significantly at either site. A decrease in amounts of Olsen P, calcium
   and potassium in soil (0-10 cm depth) by 42-50\% occurred at one site
   due to an effect of perennial grasses. The highest millet yields were
   measured in plots on which the largest amounts of biomass had been burnt
   after clear-cutting. These results confirmed that short-term fallows do
   not replenish soil organic matter and nutrient contents. The
   introduction of planted species did not arrest the decline in soil
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{Interseeded cover crops have the potential to maintain and improve soil
   quality, reduce the incidence of insect pests, and suppress weeds in
   vegetable production systems. However, the successful use of interseeded
   cover crops has been limited by their tendency to either inadequately
   suppress weeds or suppress both weeds and the crop. We hypothesized that
   in irrigated broccoli production, winter rye could suppress annual weeds
   through rapid emergence and shading, without adversely affecting the
   taller transplanted broccoli crop. In field experiments conducted in New
   York from 1999-2001, broccoli was cultivated at 0, 10, or 10 and 20 d
   after broccoli transplanting (DAT), with or without rye at the final
   cultivation. Rye interseeded at 0 DAT suppressed weeds and improved
   yields relative to unweeded controls but resulted in broccoli yield
   losses relative to weed-free controls in 2 of 3 years. Rye seeded at
   either 10 or 20 DAT did not reduce broccoli yields but had little effect
   on weeds for a given level of cultivation and resulted in Powell
   amaranth seed production of up to 28,000 seeds m(-2). Rye interseeded at
   0 DAT reduced light availability to weeds in 2000 but not in 2001 when
   Powell amaranth avoided shading from rye through rapid emergence and
   vertical growth. In greenhouse pot experiments, low temperatures for 7 d
   after seeding delayed the emergence of Powell amaranth by 3 d relative
   to rye and increased the suppression of Powell amaranth by rye from 61
   to 85\%. Our results suggest that winter rye may be more successfully
   integrated into broccoli production (1) when sown at higher densities,
   (2) in locations or seasons (e.g., spring) with lower initial
   temperatures, and (3) in combination with other weed management tools.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of some
   mulching materials on soil biochemical properties that represent a
   component of soil quality and functionality. Wheat straw, dairy manure
   compost, and black polyethylene were used in the mulching experiments of
   a soil seeded with forage maize. Soil samples were taken from the
   surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (10-20 cm) layers 1 and 4 mo after
   treatments were applied. Soil productivity, biochemical and chemical
   properties were determined. Compost treatment showed the highest
   agronomic yield due to the release of nutrients for plant nutrition and
   soil metabolism. Dehydrogenase activity was used as a measurement of
   overall microbial activity, whereas beta-glucosidase and urease
   hydrolase activities were determined as an expression of C and N cycles.
   In addition, a ratio between dehydrogenase activity and water soluble
   carbon (defined as ``metabolic potential index{''}) was calculated, in
   order to better represent soil metabolic potential. Compost-mulch
   treatment showed the lowest ratio values, while straw mulch had the
   highest value. A similar trend was found for beta-glucosidase activity.
   The data confirmed the validity and sensitivity of the metabolic
   potential index and beta-glucosidase enzyme in monitoring the change of
   soil biochemical properties and of soil quality during soil management

Abstract = {{In grassed-down fruit orchards, understorey plant residues have been
   shown to constitute an important source of soil organic matter and plant
   nutrients in biological and integrated fruit production systems. Under
   these systems, contrasting understorey plant residue types and different
   orchard treeline management practices, may affect the decomposition
   rates and nutrient release from these residues. Although a recent field
   study has found these factors to be important, their detailed
   comparisons have not been conducted. In the present study, two
   incubation experiments were conducted concurrently in the laboratory at
   25degreesC for 110 days. Experiment I examined the relationships between
   residue quality characteristics and decomposition rates of a range of
   six organic residues and three understorey plant residues from
   biological and integrated fruit orchard systems. A control treatment
   without added residue was also studied. All residues were analyzed for
   important biochemical quality factors. Experiment II evaluated the
   effects of simulated orchard treeline management practices, involving
   adding the above three orchard understorey plant residues to each of
   three different surfaces consisting of bar. e soil, pea straw mulch and
   pine bark. mulch. Plots cumulative CO2-C production of residues fitted
   an exponential relationship of C = C-0(1-e(-kt)) where k is the
   cumulative CO2-C decomposition rate constant and C-0 the asymptotic
   cumulative maximum C mineralized. This relationship accounted for 97 to
   99\% of the variations in. CO2-C production in all residues except
   sawdust (78\%) and pine bark (89\%). No significant differences occurred
   in k and C-0 values of the three orchard understorey plant residues.
   These values were similar to those of the clover residue but were
   significantly higher than those of pea straw, barley straw, spent
   mushroom compost, pine bark and sawdust. Results of all residues were
   significantly correlated with cellulose, lignin, lignin + polyphenol
   contents, cellulose:N; lignin:N, (lignin+polyplienol):N, and C:N but not
   polyphenol content. Decomposition rates of understorey residues were
   most rapid on bare soil compared to mulched surfaces and were
   significantly lowest on pea straw surface.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this article is to apply fuzzy set and interpolation
   techniques for land suitability evaluation for maize in Northern Ghana.
   Land suitability indices were computed at point observations using the
   Semantic Import (SI) model, whereas spatial interpolation was carried
   out by block kriging. Interpolated land suitability shows a high
   correlation (R-2 = 0.87) with observed maize yield at the village level.
   This indicates that lend Suitability is closely related to maize yield
   in the study area. Membership functions were further used to assess the
   degree of limitation of land characteristics to maize. Sixty percent of
   the data has membership functions ranging from 0.23 for ECEC to 1.00 for
   drainage. ECEC, organic C, and clay are the major constraints to maize
   yield. The use of the fuzzy technique is helpful for land suitability
   evaluation, especially in applications in which subtle differences in
   soil quality are of a major interest. Furthermore, the use of kriging
   that exploits spatial variability of data is useful in producing
   continuous land Suitability maps and in estimating uncertainties
   associated with predicted land suitability indices.}},

   rice production to meet the increased need of food production through
   increased rice productivity to ensure food security. In contrast, the
   recent slowdown in yield growth in intensive irrigated rice-based
   cropping systems as a result of deterioration of soil health and decline
   in productivity level is a serious cause for concern. The objective of
   this research was to investigate the soil organic carbon (SOC) build-up
   and its dynamics in rice-rice cropping system by including a green
   manure (GM) crop Sesbania rostrata Berm. either during fallow and/or
   intercrop at 4 : 1 ratio as additive series without changing rice
   geometry. The results revealed that there is a gradual build-up of SOC
   when S. rostrata included and in situ incorporated at flowering stage as
   a basic means of improving soil quality in rice-rice cropping system.
   Further, the soil organic matter fractions viz. humic acid and fulvic
   acid were also improved in all GM-incorporated systems. In general, the
   proportion of fulvic acid was higher than humic acid. Cropping system
   involving three GMs viz. S. rostrata-rice/S. rostrata-rice/S. rostrata
   registered significantly higher SOC and was 10.63 percent higher than
   traditional rice-rice cropping system (A(1)). This was followed by S.
   rostrata-rice/S. rostrata-rice system. Although the traditional
   rice-rice cropping system (A(1)) also conserved SOC (0.29 and 1.69 \%
   higher than initial during first and second annual cropping cycle,
   respectively), the magnitude was very low. Repeated application of S.
   rostrata as GM improved SOC, which formed the basis for sustainable
   management of soil resources. It can be concluded that S. rostrata would
   affect the rate of loss of SOC in cropping systems and its ultimate
   level in soils.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality indices are useful for ascertaining temporal changes in
   soil properties in relation to land use and management, especially for
   drastically disturbed soils, and for designing the best management
   systems for minesoil reclamation. Soil quality indices were developed by
   analyzing physical and chemical properties of the minesoils in Jackson
   and Vinton counties, Ohio, reclaimed in 1975 and 1976. Soil properties
   were also assessed for the adjoining unmined soil and the spoil. The
   principle component analysis (PCA) was performed on 20 physical and
   chemical soil properties, separately for each experimental site, for 0-
   to 10-cm depth. The PCA performed with correlation matrix grouped 20
   measured soil attributes into four distinct principle components (PCs)
   for each site. The PCs were related to measured soil properties, based
   on their communality estimates. The factors identified were (i) bulk
   density, (ii) water infiltration, (iii) aggregate size, and (iv) soil
   nitrogen for the Jackson site and (i) bulk density, (ii) water
   infiltration, (iii) organic carbon, and (iv) porosity for the Vinton
   site. These factors were assessed with respect to the specific soil
   functions and were designated as soil quality indicators. The
   discriminant analysis of retained PCs showed that the bulk density
   factor was the most discriminating and water stable aggregation the most
   dominating common measured soil attribute or the dynamic soil quality
   indicator for both sites. Other soil quality indicators varied in the
   order soil bulk density > field water capacity > clay concentration.
   These factors monitored over time are indicators of change in soil
   quality, whether aggrading, degrading, or stable.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the tillage erosion studies have focused on the effect of
   tractor-plough tillage on soil translocation and soil loss. Only
   recently, have a few studies contributed to the understanding of tillage
   erosion by manual tillage. Furthermore, little is known about the impact
   of tillage erosion in hilly areas of the humid sub-tropics. This study
   on tillage erosion by hoeing was conducted on a purple soil (Regosols)
   of the steep land, in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, southwestern
   China (30degrees24'N and 104degrees35'E) using the physical tracer
   method.
   The effects of hoeing tillage on soil translocation on hillslopes are
   quite evident. The tillage transport coefficients were 26-38 kg m(-1)
   per tillage pass and 121-175 kg m(-1) per tillage pass respectively for
   k(3)- and k(4)-values. Given that there was a typical downslope parcel
   length of 15 m and two times of tillage per year in this area, the
   tillage erosion rates on the 4-43\% hillslopes reached 48-151 Mg ha(-1)
   per year. The downslope soil translocation is closely related to slope
   gradient. Lateral soil translocation by such tillage is also obvious
   though it is lower than downslope soil translocation. Strong downslope
   translocation accounts for thin soil layers and the exposure of parent
   materials/rocks at the ridge tops and on convexities in the hilly areas.
   Deterioration in soil quality and therefore reduction in plant
   productivity due to tillage-induced erosion would be evident at the
   ridge tops and convex shoulders. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{In the Horqin Sandy Land of eastern Inner Mongolia in northern China,
   wind erosion in farmland is very common in a period from thawing of
   frozen surface soil in mid-March to sowing of crops in the end of April,
   largely because of dry and windy weather. However, little is known about
   the magnitude of wind erosion and associated nutrient losses due to
   erosion and the addition of nutrients by airborne dust deposition to
   farmlands during this period. A field experiment was conducted in an
   Entisol with sand origin under corn (Zea mays L.) production to
   investigate daily changes in wind speed and wind erosion intensity (as
   measured by soil transport rate) over a period from 20 March to 30 April
   2001. We also measured daily rates of airborne dust deposition during
   the spring seasons with the high frequency of dust storm occurrence. The
   rates of soil transport by wind varied greatly from 13.2 to 1254.1 kg
   ha(-1) per day, averaging 232.1 kg ha(-1) per day, largely attributable
   to great variation between days in wind speed within the study period.
   The potential losses of nutrients through wind erosion were 0.26-24.95
   kg ha(-1) per day (averaging 4.62 kg ha(-1) per day) in organic matter,
   0.02-1.64 kg ha(-1) per day (averaging 0.31 kg ha(-1) per day) in
   nitrogen and 0.01-0.7 kg ha(-1) per day (averaging 0.13 kg ha(-1) per
   day) in phosphorus. The mean rates of airborne dust deposition ranged
   from 4.0 to 48.9 kg ha(-1) per day, averaging 19.9 kg ha(-1) per day,
   during the spring seasons. The potential addition of organic matter,
   nitrogen and phosphorus by dust input to the experimental field was, on
   average, 0.54, 0.04 and 0.02 kg ha(-1) per day, respectively. Although
   the addition was a fraction of the losses due to erosion, nevertheless,
   dust input in the spring seasons is one of the major suppliers of soil
   nutrition. The fact that the addition of nutrients by dust is about 1/10
   of the losses of soil nutrients through wind erosion suggests that
   developing and adopting more effective management practices to reduce
   soil erosion losses and to improve soil fertility are crucial to achieve
   a sustainable agricultural system in a fragile, semiarid sandy land
   environment. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of three cotton-based cropping systems on soil properties,
   black root rot severity, and growth of cotton in a Vertisol were
   evaluated after a series of floods in eastern Australia. The
   experimental treatments, which had been imposed since 1985, were
   conventionally and minimum-tilled continuous cotton, and minimum-tilled
   cotton-wheat rotation. Frequent rainfall and flooding during the winter
   of 1998 resulted in near saturated soil at spring sowing in October.
   Although conventional tillage operations were completed before flooding,
   minimum tillage operations were not possible due to excessive moisture
   and cotton was sown onto the old beds with no-tillage. Soil specific
   volume (electrical conductivity of a 1:5 soil:water suspension) EC1:5,
   exchangeable Na content, pH and organic C were determined for the top
   0.6 m of the profile in summer 1998 and again in 1999. Organic C in the
   surface 0.10 m was also evaluated during 1998-2000. Black root rot
   severity and mycorrhizal fungal colonisation were evaluated at 6 weeks
   after sowing. Tissue nutrient concentrations were measured in mature
   cotton plants. Cotton lint yield and fibre quality were evaluated after
   picking and ginning.
   In comparison with either minimum- or conventionally tilled continuous
   cotton, minimum-tilled cotton-wheat rotation had the lowest exchangeable
   Na content and severity of bacterial black root rot, best surface
   structure and the highest crop growth, nutrient uptake and lint yields.
   Subsoil structure was the best with conventionally tilled continuous
   cotton. The 1998 floods appear to have decreased exchangeable Na and
   increased soil pH in all treatments. Surface organic C also decreased
   between 1998 and 2000. Soil structural damage was minimised by avoiding
   tillage and trafficking in wet conditions. Compared with 1998, average
   yield decreases in 1999 were of the order of 43\%. Cotton lint fibre
   quality was also poorer in 1999. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Agricultural managers that operate at different levels (plot, farm,
   landscape, region) need to understand how ecological functions (energy,
   nutrients and water flows and cycles) are controlled by scale-dependent
   factors. Using cross-level data from the Argentine pampas, analyzed by
   simple and multiple regression analysis, we demonstrate that controls
   differ from one spatio-temporal level to the other, but they can be
   altered by humans. In the Argentine pampas, environmental controls
   (climate, landform, soil quality) seem to have a strong top-down
   influence on lower levels. But the bottom-up aggregated effect of
   anthropogenic controls seems to scale-up to upper levels and counteract
   such influence. Thus, the more intense use of land and technology in
   small units, the larger the up-scaling human influence on ecological
   functions. We suggest that a discrimination among fanning intensity
   levels is useful and necessary to understand and predict human controls
   on ecological functions across scales. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Pages = {{53-62}},
Abstract = {{Homegardens are considered a sustainable production system in the
   tropics, which contributes to biodiversity conservation. The aim of this
   study was the description of crop diversity, structure and management of
   homegardens in Central Sulawesi and their classification. In 30
   homegardens randomly selected from three villages adjacent to the Lore
   Lindu National Park, species diversity and abundance were assessed and
   the Shannon index was calculated. Overall 149 crop species were
   identified, mainly fruit, vegetable, spice, or medicinal plants. The
   number of vegetation layers differed depending on age and size of
   homegardens. Cluster analysis of crop species composition was used to
   classify different garden types. Not only the spectrum of species
   cultivated in the homegardens but also the occurrence of these garden
   types was different among the three villages. This finding was supported
   by Sorensen's coefficient. Homegardens from one village, mainly
   inhabited by transmigrants, contrasted strongly with those from the
   other two. A markedly lower number of crop species was cultivated there,
   and species composition was clearly different. The number of crop
   species and species composition found in homegardens may be attributed
   to socio-economic conditions of garden keepers as well as to soil
   quality. Both productivity and sustainability can be enhanced, e.g., by
   improved soil fertility management such as applying available farm yard
   manure.}},

Abstract = {{Approaches to assess the effects of management practices on
   agro-ecosystem functions are needed. This paper describes a computer
   program designed to assess the relative sustainability of management
   practices using agronomic and environmental data. The program, entitled
   AgroEcosystem Performance Assessment Tool (AEPAT), utilizes
   performance-based index methodology to derive a relative ranking of
   agroecosystem performance among management practices for functions and
   indicators included in the procedure. The program is organized into
   eight major steps: Introduction, Input Files, Assign Indicators to
   Functions, Describe Indicators, Assign Weights, Select Output File,
   Calculate Agroecosystem Performance Scores, and Save Agroecosystem
   Project. Help windows as well as a tutorial are provided within the
   program to assist users through each step. Users must keep in mind the
   assumptions and drawbacks inherent to performance-based indices while
   using AEPAT. Additionally, the program requires data on many indicators
   to provide useful information on agroecosystem performance. Therefore,
   its use is intended primarily for clientele conducting long-term
   agroecosystem experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The extensive zero-water exchange shrimp farming system in the periphery
   of Chilka lagoon (Orissa, India) was studied. The study aimed to
   describe this unique farming system with special reference to dynamics
   of macrozoobenthos, production characteristics and economics. The study
   conducted was based on a general survey as well as monitoring of five
   individual farms over a complete production cycle. The fanning practice
   in this area is characterized by complete absence of water exchange
   during rearing. Ponds in this area are generally shallow (mean 72 cm).
   Most of the water and soil quality characteristics of these farms are
   within acceptable levels. Macrozoobenthos belonging to 12 taxa were
   collected, amphipods (81\%) and polychaetes (13\%) being most numerous.
   Overall macrobenthic density of farms studied varied from 968 to 11,470
   individuals/m(2) with a gross mean of 5644 individuals/m(2). There was
   no general pattern to the variation in abundance of various taxa in
   different phases of the rearing cycle, suggesting a low predatory
   pressure by shrimp in the farms studied. Shrimp production was highly
   variable (91-250 kg/ha), but generally low with a mean of 145 kg/ha. The
   net income of these farms was estimated to be Rs. 63,250 per crop per
   ha. Compared with shrimp farming system with regular water exchange in
   the same area, Chilka farms generated high benefit-cost ratio indicating
   high profitability and sustainability.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH}},

Pages = {{163-170}},
Abstract = {{Soil organic matter can modify the interaction of clay minerals with
   water, limiting the rate of water intake of swelling clays and
   stabilising soil aggregates. Soil structural stability and organic C
   content usually decrease with cultivation. Faster wetting increases
   stresses on aggregates and decreases stability. Aggregate wettabilities
   of prairie soils under 3 different management systems (grassland,
   no-till, and conventional-till) were compared in the Northern Great
   Plains of the USA. Six Ustolls and 2 Usterts were selected as
   replications along the Missouri River. Wettability was measured as water
   drop penetration time (WDPT) and as rate of water intake under 30 and
   300 mm tension. At low tension, aggregates from both cultivated fields
   and uncultivated grasslands showed similar wettability. Water intake in
   grass aggregates was attributed to a greater amount of stable pores
   relative to cultivated aggregates. In cultivated aggregates, slaking
   created planes of failure that allowed rapid water entry. Differences of
   wettability between management systems at 300 mm tension (in Ustolls,
   grasslands had greater wettability than cultivated soils, 0.24 v. 0.17 g
   water/h.g dry soil) and between soil orders (Usterts had longer WDPT
   than Ustolls, 2.9 v. 1.7 s) were explained by both clay and organic C
   contents. Simple measurements of aggregate wettability may be
   effectively used for soil quality characterisation. Aggregate
   wettability is a desirable property for agricultural soils when it is
   related to stable porosity, as may be found in high organic matter soils
   (e. g. grasslands). Wettability is excessive when fast aggregate wetting
   results in aggregate destruction as observed in low organic matter
   cultivated soils.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of soil quality through soil organic carbon (SOC) management
   has been a major concern for tropical soils. SOC is sensitive to human
   activities such as deforestation, biomass burning, land-use changes, and
   environmental pollution. Our aim in this study was to elucidate the
   effect of land-use systems on quasi-equilibrium values (QEV) of SOC. To
   determine the QEV of SOC, 4 representative pedons from Nagpur district,
   Maharashtra, under horticulture (orange), agriculture (cotton, cotton +
   pigeonpea), and forest (teak) with the time of cultivation ranging from
   20 years to centuries were selected. The study indicated that the QEV of
   SOC in the shrink-swell soils decreased when they were used for
   agricultural crop production. Since all these soils have similar
   substrate, the SOC equilibrium values obtained in soils of horticultural
   and forest ecosystems may also be attainable in the soils under
   agricultural system. In other words, addition of external sources of
   farmyard manure or other green manure may raise the QEV of SOC from
   0.44-0.51\% to 0.70-0.80\% in soils of agricultural system.}},

Abstract = {{Iron Cove catchment (similar to1500 ha) on the southern shores of Port
   Jackson ( Sydney) has been highly urbanised (>90\%) for a considerable
   time (1800s). A map of the area was divided into squares 200 by 200 m
   and a soil sample was taken randomly in each defined area from the
   dominant land use type in each square (n = 374). The objectives of the
   study were to determine the distribution and sources of heavy metals
   (Cu, Pb, Zn) in surface soils over the catchment and to assess soil
   quality in terms of guidelines and bioavailability of these metals.
   The concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn were determined for total soil and
   on a normalised basis. These metals are elevated across the whole
   catchment, with mean total concentrations for Cu, Pb, and Zn of 62, 410,
   and 343 mg/kg and 50 percentiles of 44, 203, and 224 mg/kg,
   respectively, whereas mean enrichment over background is 2, 5.5, and 4.6
   times, respectively. Such a wide, regional metal enrichment is probably
   related to atmospheric deposition from industry inside and beyond the
   catchment. The highest concentrations of most metals were in soils from
   the north-east part of the catchment in an area where dwellings and
   buildings are oldest and where major roads and railway lines converge.
   Normalise data suggest sources of these metals are roads, railway lines,
   and older lead-painted houses. Independent studies in the catchment
   support roads as being an important source of metals in the area. Total

Abstract = {{The study was conducted at Caffee Doonsa (08degrees88'N, 39degrees08'E;
   2400 m asl), a small watershed in the central highlands of Ethiopia, in
   order to identify farmers' goals of soil management and the indicators
   they use in selecting soils for a certain function, and to categorise
   the soils in different quality groups with respect to the major
   functions. Thirty-six male farmers of different age and wealth groups
   participated in a Participatory Rural Appraisal technique. They listed
   and prioritised 12 soil functions in the area and itemised the soil
   quality indicators (characteristics). Based on the indicators, the soils
   in the watershed were classified into 3 soil quality (SQ) groups
   (Abolse, Kooticha, and Carii). The SQ groups have been evaluated and
   ranked for the major soil functions. For crop production, Abolse was
   graded best, followed by Kooticha and Carii, respectively. The grain and
   straw yield data of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) taken from the SQ
   groups confirmed the farmers claim, in that Abolse gave the highest
   grain yield (4573 kg/ha), followed by 4411 and 3657 kg/ha for Kooticha
   and Carii, respectively. Local insights should be included in systematic
   soil quality assessment, and in planning and implementation of various
   soil management interventions.}},

Abstract = {{The calculation of parameters involved in the kinetics of the microbial
   soil reactions linked to the carbon cycle is strongly limited by the
   methodologies employed. Hence, a mathematical model is proposed to
   quantify easily the specific rate of catabolic activity A(c) by
   microcalorimetry based on Belaich's model. It permits to quantify A(c)
   from the plots of the heat flow rate vs. time recorded from soil samples
   amended with glucose. It was applied for several soil samples collected
   in the Amazon. The results obtained were compared, and statistical and
   graphical analyses were used to provide the biophysical significance of
   A(c) in soils. Results suggest that A(c) could be used as an empirical
   measure of stress. It correlates positively with the heat yield, Y-QIX,
   of the soil microbial growth reactions, indicating that higher specific
   rates of catabolic activity cause higher dissipation of energy per unit
   of cell, yielding less-efficient metabolic reactions, which could affect
   negatively the soil quality. It is strongly affected by the initial
   microbial population and by the percentage of nitrogen in the samples.
   The statistical analysis also demonstrated that A(c) is more sensitive
   to changing environmental conditions than Y-QIX, yielding more-accurate
   information about the soil metabolic processes.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic-induced soil compaction and tillage systems can impact the
   productivity and sustainability of agricultural soils. The objective of
   this study was to assess the response of soil microbial populations to
   wheel-traffic in two tillage systems on a Norfolk loamy sand (Typic
   Kandiudults; FAO classification Luxic Ferralsols). Experimental
   variables were with and without traffic under conventional tillage (disk
   harrow twice, chisel plow, field cultivator-planter) vs. no tillage
   employed in a split-plot design with four replications; main plots were
   traffic and subplots were tillage. Soil samples were collected from 0-2
   and 2-4-cm depths, sieved (2 mm), and used to assess soilwater content,
   microbial biomass nitrogen (N), dehydrogenase, and microbial
   characterization using phospholipid ester-linked fatty acid (PLFA)
   analysis. Traffic increased soil-water content, had little affect on
   microbial biomass N, and increased microbial activity (no-till plots
   only) likely due to increased amounts of residue. Soil-water content,
   microbial biomass N, PLFA estimates of microbial biomass, and microbial
   activity were all consistently higher in no-till compared to
   conventional tillage plots. Data from this study suggest that
   conventional tillage results in a lower, more static, possibly more
   mature community of microbes while the microbial community under no-till
   appears to be a younger, more viable growing population. Finally, these
   data suggest that overall soil quality, at least in the surface soil
   layer, is improved in agricultural systems employing no-till operations.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation and land-use mosaics of shrub land, grassland, farmland and
   reforested land are characteristic for residential areas of the Wolong
   nature reserve in Sichuan province, southwest China. The patterns
   represent a stage in long-term human disturbance and natural secondary
   succession since deforestation. The aim of this paper was to elucidate
   the soil-land cover types, soil-slope position relationships on a
   typical disturbed slope in the humid mountainous region. Soils were
   taken from four typical land cover types (shrub land, grassland,
   farmland and reforested land) under four slope positions (upper slope,
   middle slope, lower slope, foot slope) to study the distribution of soil
   nutrients and moisture on the transect scales of the slope. To elucidate
   the influence of land-use and slope position on soil quality, two
   integrated quantitative indexes were developed to compare soil quality
   under different land-use types (QI) and under different slope positions
   (PI). The results showed shrub land had the highest QI value, while the
   QI of reforested land and farmland had lower values. Foot slopes and
   upper slopes had higher soil quality levels compared to middle slopes
   and lower slopes. The results indicated that on the slope scale shrub
   land had high soil quality levels. The results also suggested that in
   the area of China where the climate favors secondary succession, `leave
   nature as it is' is a better choice than the policy `change farmland to
   forest land'.}},

Title = {{Soil parent material may control forest floor properties more than stand

Journal = {{ECOSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2004}},

Pages = {{228-237}},
Abstract = {{Soil quality in the boreal mixedwood forest depends to a certain extent
   on the chemical, biochemical, and microbial properties of the forest
   floor. Given that forest floors are composed mainly of decomposing plant
   detritus, forest composition (i.e., stand type) should play a key role
   in determining soil quality. Stand age is also expected to control
   certain forest floor properties, due to the balance in the amount and
   quality of substrates introduced into, and lost from, the forest floor
   during stand development. Finally, mineral parent material should also
   be related to some forest floor properties, by controlling site nutrient
   capital which may affect litter quality. In order to compare the
   relative effects of these three factors, forest floor material was
   collected in the Abitibi region of northwestern Quebec, from replicated
   (n = 3) treatment plots comprising a factorial array of three stand
   types (spruce/fir, aspen, and paper birch), three stand ages (57, 78-85,
   and 131 y-old), and two parent materials (clay and till). Forest floor
   samples were compared on the basis of 18 variables depicting i) chemical
   properties, ii) base cation status, in) nitrogen cycling, and iv)
   microbial properties. All three sampling factors exerted a significant
   effect on some of the measured forest floor properties, but parent
   material had a significant effect on twice the number of forest floor
   properties as did stand type or stand age. Besides exerting an effect on
   nutrient capital, we propose that parent material also affects cation
   exchange capacity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, which in turn
   influence litter quality and ecosystem productivity. Our results
   suggest, therefore, that a detailed classification of mineral parent
   materials might be a useful basis for interpreting and predicting soil
   quality in the mixedwood boreal forest.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of biomarkers to integrate effects of chemicals on biota has
   lead to increased calls for their application in assessing the status of
   polluted ecosystems. In tandem there has been an increase in our
   knowledge of the ecophysiological responses of keystone species to
   pollutants, which has allowed the development of a number of promising
   methods. In contrast to the number of biomarker development studies, the
   number of biomarker validation studies has remained limited. This paper
   redresses this imbalance by drawing together data from studies that have
   used the earthworm lysosomal membrane stability response (measured using
   the neutral red retention assay). This review first gives a short
   history of the biomarker's development. Second, it sets published
   applications of the technique against established criteria for a
   ``good{''} biomarker (i.e., dose-response relationship, sensitivity,
   ecological relevance, confounding factors, chemical specificity, species
   differences, time-response relationship, methodological concerns, and
   overall public/regulator confidence, and acceptance). Discussion of the
   biomarker's suitability to each criterion is followed by an overall
   evaluation of its workability for routine soil quality assessment and
   caveats for its use. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Prospective model-based approaches to desertification are hindered by a
   lack of unifying process specifications underlying the phenomenon, and
   by the difficulty of forecasting trends in its driving forces.
   Elementary concepts for a dynamic systems approach to desertification
   are discussed as a groundwork for the prospective task. Emphasis on the
   differentiation between `relict' and `current' desertification enables
   successful treatment programs to be planned. The prospective task
   focuses on the Southern European Union countries (Greece, Italy, France,
   Spain and Portugal), which share more than 95\% of the southern European
   Mediterranean climate area. The effort to control relict desertification
   has been evaluated using the evolution of forest-woodland and
   agricultural areas over a period of time, together with the total
   reforested area. Current risk of desertification was approached in three
   steps: (i) analysis of the temporal evolution of a driver-level
   indicator such as the per capita Net Internal Agricultural Produce
   (ANIP); (ii) examination of the associated changes in land-use systems
   indicators, and (iii) exploring the impact of these changes on natural
   resources. Results show that in Southern EU countries, the older
   traditional agriculture will continue to be transformed into that of an
   open market. This process involves the development of site-selective and
   technically sophisticated irrigated agriculture. The main consequence is
   a build-up of large water deficits, particularly if climate change
   scenarios are considered, with severe impact on: (i) water and soil
   quality and (ii) interregional conflicts triggered by, affecting large
   areas of irrigation water suppliers. Prospects for EU agricultural
   policies indicate a shift from supporting production to helping
   integrated development and sustainability. Within this scenario,
   desertification factors, such as overstocking rangelands and tree crops
   encroaching in marginal areas, are unlikely to persist while restoration
   of threats of relict desertification is expected to increase in the near
   future.}},

Title = {{Assessing the efficacy of dredged materials from lake Panasoffkee,
   Florida: Implication to environment and agriculture - Part 1: Soil and
   environmental quality aspect}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{321-326}},
Abstract = {{Background, Aims and Scope. Dredged materials because of its variable
   but unique physical and chemical properties are often viewed by society
   and regulators as pollutants, but many have used these materials in
   coastal nourishment, land or wetland creation, construction materials,
   and for soil improvement as a soil amendment. Environmental impact
   assessment is an important pre-requisite to many dredging initiatives.
   The ability to reuse lake-dredge materials (LDM) for agricultural
   purposes is important because it reduces the need for offshore disposal
   and provides an alternative to disposal of the materials in landfills.
   Additional research on disposal options of dredged materials are much
   needed to supply information on criteria testing and evaluation of the
   physical and chemical impacts of dredged materials at a disposal site,
   as well as information on many other aspects of dredging and dredged
   material disposal. While preliminary efforts are underway to provide
   information to establish criteria for land disposal, testing procedures
   for possible land disposal of contaminated sediments are still in their
   developing stage. The objective of this study (Part 1) was to quantify
   the effect of applied LDM from Lake Panasoffkee (LP), Florida on soil
   physico-chemical properties (soil quality) at the disposal site. This
   series of two papers aims at providing assessment of the efficacy of
   lake-dredged materials from LP especially its implication to environment
   (soil quality, Part 1) and agriculture (forage quality and pasture
   establishment, Part 2).
   Methods. The experimental treatments that were evaluated consisted of
   different ratios of natural soil (NS) to LDM: LDM0 (100\% NS:0\% LDM);
   LDM25 (75\% NS:25\% LDM); LDM50 (50\% NS:50\% LDM); LDM75 (25\% NS:75\%
   LDM); and LDM100 (0\% NS:100\% LDM). Field layout was based on the
   principle of a completely randomized block design with four
   replications. The Mehlich 1 method (0.05 (N) under bar HCl in 0.025 (N)
   under bar H2SO4) was used for chemical extraction of soil. Soil P and
   other exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Al, and Fe) were analyzed using
   an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Spectroscopy. The effects of dredged
   materials addition on soil quality and compaction were analyzed
   statistically following the PROC ANOVA procedures.
   Results and Discussion. Sediments that were dredged from LP have high
   CaCO3 content (82\%) and when these materials were incorporated into
   existing topsoil they would have the same favorable effects as liming
   the field. Thus, sediments with high CaCO3 may improve the physical and
   chemical conditions of subtropical sandy pastures. The heavy and trace
   metal contents of LDM were below the probable effect levels (PEL) and
   threshold effect levels (TEL). Average values for Pb, Zn, As, Cu, Hg,
   Se, Cd, and Ni of 5.2 +/- 1.3, 7.0 +/- 0.6, 4.4 +/- 0.1, 8.7 +/- 1.2,
   0.01 +/- 0.02, 0.02 +/- 0.02, 2.5 +/- 0.1, and 14.6 +/- 6.4 mg kg(-1),
   respectively, were below the TEL and the PEL. TEL represents the
   concentrations of sediment-associated contaminants that are considered
   to cause significant hazards to aquatic organisms, while, PEL represents
   the lower limit of the range of the contaminant concentrations that are
   usually or always associated with adverse biological effects. As such,
   the agricultural or livestock industry could utilize these LDM to
   produce forages. LDM should be regarded as a beneficial resource, as a
   part of the ecological system. Addition of LDM had significant (p less
   than or equal to 0.001) effects on soil physico-chemical properties and
   soil quality. Compared with the control plots, the soils in plots
   amended with LDM exhibited: (1) lower degree of soil compaction; (2) an
   increase in soil pH, Ca, and Mg; (3) decrease in the levels of soil Mn,
   Cu, Fe, Zn, and Si; and (4) no significant change in the level of Na in
   the soil. Results have shown the favorable influence that LDM had on
   soil compaction. The treatment x year interaction effect was not
   significant, but the average soil compaction varied widely (p: 0.001)
   with LDM application. In 2002 and 2003, soil compaction of plots was
   lowered significantly as a result of LDM additions. The least compacted
   soils in 2002 and 2003 were observed from plots with LDM75 with mean
   soil compaction of 300 x 10(3) and 350 x 10(3) Pa, respectively.
   Conclusion. Beneficial uses of dredged materials from LP, Florida are
   both economical and environmental. Often these materials can be obtained
   at little or no cost to the farmers or landowners in south Florida.
   Environmentally, dredging of sediments that are rich in CaCO3 should
   restore the 19.4-sq km LP by removing natural sediments from the lake
   bottom to improve the fishery, water quality, and navigation of the
   lake. The bottom sediment materials from lakes, river, and navigational
   channels usually are composed of upland soil enriched with nutrients and
   organic matter. These materials should be regarded as a beneficial
   resource to be used productively and not to be discarded as spoil
   materials.
   Recommendation and Outlook. Land application of LDM from LP may not only
   provide substantial benefits that will enhance the environment,
   community, and society in south Florida, but also in other parts of the
   world especially those areas having tropical and subtropical climate
   with forage-based beef cattle pastures. The heavy and trace metal
   contents of LDM from LP were below the PEL and TEL. As such, the
   agricultural or livestock industry could utilize these LDM to produce
   forages (Part 2 of this study). LDM should be regarded as a beneficial
   resource, as a part of the ecological system. Further studies are still
   needed to determine whether the environmental and ecological
   implications of LDM application are satisfied over the longer term.}},

Abstract = {{Background, Aims and Scope. Current dredged material disposal
   alternatives have several limitations. Options for dealing with dredged
   materials include leaving them alone, capping them with clean sediments,
   placing them in confined facilities, disposing of them at upland sites,
   treating them chemically, or using them for wetlands creation or other
   beneficial uses The ability to reuse lake-dredge materials (LDM) for
   agricultural purposes is important because it reduces the need for
   offshore disposal and provides an alternative to disposal of the
   materials in landfills. Often these materials can be obtained at little
   or no cost to the farmers or landowners. Thus, forage production offers
   an alternative to waste management since nutrients in the LDM are
   recycled into crops that are not directly consumed by humans. The
   objective of this study (Part 2) were to: (1) assess dredge materials
   from Lake Panasoffkee, Florida as a soil amendment to establish
   bahiagrass (BG) in a subtropical beef cattle pasture in Sumter County,
   Florida; and (2) determine the effect of LDM application on the crude
   protein (CP) and nutrient uptake of BG. This series of two papers aims
   at providing assessment of the efficacy of lake-dredged materials
   especially its implication to environment (soil quality, Part 1) and
   agriculture (forage quality and pasture establishment, Part 2).
   Methods. The experimental treatments that were evaluated consisted of
   different ratios of natural soil (NS) to LDM: LDM0 (100\% NS:0\% LDM);
   LDM25 (75\% NS:25\% LDM); LDM50 (50\% NS:50\% LDM); LDM75 (25\% NS:75\%
   LDM); and LDM100 (0\% NS:100\% LDM). Bahiagrass plots at its early
   establishment were cut to a 5-cm stubble height on Julian days 112 and
   harvested to the same stubble height on Julian days 238 and on Julian
   days 546 following the double-ring method. Field layout was based on the
   principle of a completely randomized block design with four
   replications. Plant samples harvested at 546 Julian days were ground to
   pass through a 1-mm mesh screen in a Wiley mill. Ground forage was
   analyzed for crude protein. Ground forage samples were also analyzed for
   tissue P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Cu, Fe, Al, and Mo concentrations using an ICP
   spectroscopy. The effects of dredged materials addition on forage yield
   and on crude protein and nutrient uptake that were taken at 546 Julian
   days were analyzed statistically following the PROC ANOVA procedures.
   Results and Discussion. Part 1 of this study demonstrated that the heavy
   and trace metal contents of LDM were below the probable effect levels
   and threshold effect levels. As such, the agricultural or livestock
   industry could utilize these LDM to produce forages. Results showed
   consistently and significantly (p less than or equal to 0.001) higher BG
   biomass production and CP from plots amended with LDM than those of BG
   planted on plots with 0\% LDM. Forage yield of BG during its
   establishment increased linearly (Forage Yield = 1724.3 + 25.64{*}LDM;
   R-2 = 0.83; p less than or equal to 0.0001) with increasing rates of LDM
   application. The CP of BG also varied significantly with varying levels
   of LDM applications. The tissues of BG with 100\% LDM had the greatest
   CP content while the lowest CP content was from the control plots
   (LDM0). The CP of BG increased linearly with increasing rates of LDM
   application. The crude protein response to BG application can be
   described by a linear equation: Crude Protein = 10.38 + 0.052{*}LDM; R-2
   = 0.85 p less than or equal to 0.0001. Addition of LDM had increased the
   levels of Ca by about 1811\% when compared with the level of soil Ca
   among plots with no LDM application. Liming the field could have some
   direct and indirect effects on the chemical status of the soils. The
   physiological functions performed by Ca in plants are not clearly
   defined, but it has been suggested that Ca favors the formation of and
   increases the protein content of mitochondria.
   Conclusions. Beneficial uses of dredged materials from LP, Florida are
   both economical and environmental. Often these materials can be obtained
   at little or no cost to the farmers or landowners. Results showed that
   dredged materials can be used as soil amendments (lime and fertilizer)
   for early establishment of BG in beef cattle pastures. Environmentally,
   dredging of sediments that are rich in CaCO3 should restore the 19.4-sq
   Ism LP by removing natural sediments from the lake bottom to improve the
   fishery, water quality, and navigation of the lake. The nutritional
   uptake of BG grown in unfertile sandy soils of Sumter County was
   enhanced significantly (p less than or equal to 0.001) by LDM addition.
   Uptake of TKN, TP, K, Ca, and Mg were remarkably increased as a result
   of LDM.
   Recommendation and Outlook. Land application of LDM from LP may not only
   provide substantial benefits that will enhance the environment,
   community, and society in south Florida, but also in other parts of the
   world especially those areas with forage-based beef cattle pastures and
   similar climatic conditions. The heavy and trace metal contents of these
   materials were below the PEL and TEL (see Part 1). As such, the
   agricultural or livestock industry could utilize these LDM to produce
   forages. LDM should be regarded as a beneficial resource, as a part of
   the ecological system. Although our results have demonstrated the
   favorable and beneficial effects of added LDM on the early establishment
   of BG in pasture fields., further studies are still needed not only in
   pastures of south Florida, but also in other areas with subtropical or
   tropical climatic conditions to determine whether the environmental and
   ecological implications of LDM application are satisfied over the longer
   term.}},

Abstract = {{We must understand the history of our environment. For example, what
   would happen today if we had a volcanic event like Krakatoa, 1883? This
   has been described in a recent book by Winchester {[}13]. Given a ``year
   without summer{''} how many people would die? One thing is certain: we
   must have a surplus of life support components.
   Our life support and health are related to many key components: We must
   have clean air to breathe and we would not be here without the green
   plants. We must have clean water to drink. We must have quality food and
   surplus food security depends on climate, water and soil quality. We
   must have biodiversity for security when climate fluctuations occur.
   Given our present population, we must develop adequate clean energy.
   This is possible, if we use the sun and the warm rocks under our feet,
   all natural nuclear energy. We must have an adequate supply of materials
   and we must develop new technologies as with mining. For many purposes
   we must have new construction and transport technologies which do not
   waste the planet's surface resources. There is huge potential for
   underground construction and the use of marine resources. We need new
   technologies to reduce waste and for recycling waste. Here Europe leads!
   World data are clear. Where there is a high quality of education for all
   people of all ages, male and female, population is decreasing and
   quality of life is excellent. In the development of needed new
   technologies, we require new teams from all the sciences, engineering,
   politics, and we need new economics which consider the needs of future
   generations. We live in the age of TV culture, but who controls the
   quality of TV information?
   We can save this world and people can have a high quality of life now
   and in the future. But all people must understand our life support
   systems. Yes, many nations must reduce populations for security. In
   solving almost all the world problems Europe leads.. Europe has the
   lowest birthrates in the world!}},

Abstract = {{When embankments are constructed over soft foundations, stability often
   becomes one of the controlling factors in design. Deep mixing methods
   have been commonly used as an alternative to improve soft soil to
   enhance the stability. Bishop's modified method is a commonly adopted
   approach for analyzing slope stability including embankments over deep
   mixed (DM) foundations. Bishop's modified method assumed failure along a
   circular slip surface and the soils along this slip surface provide
   shear resistance. However, experimental and numerical studies have
   showed that deep mixed columns under a combination of vertical and
   horizontal forces could fail due to shearing or bending. The bending
   failure cannot be analyzed by Bishop's method. A finite difference
   method was used in this study to evaluate the factors influencing the
   stability of embankments over deep mixed foundations, which include
   strength, spacing, and size of DM columns, undrained shear strength and
   thickness of soft soil, quality and height of embankment fill, and
   traffic loading. Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion was used for embankment
   fill, foundation soil, and deep mixed columns. In addition, the tensile
   strength of deep mixed columns was assumed to be 10\% of their undrained
   shear strength. A row of deep mixed columns was modeled as a wall in 2-D
   for simplicity of analysis. Deep mixed columns were embedded into a firm
   soil to create a possibility of bending failure. The numerical analysis
   indicated that the factors of safety of the embankments over DM
   foundations depend on these influence factors and the failure mode
   changes from deep-seated failure to slope failure within the embankment
   fill.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of various plant species, two leguminous trees (Andira
   inermes and Albizia procera), two leguminous covercrops (Arachis
   glabrata and Centrosema acutifolium), and two grasses (Brachiaria
   humidicola and Hemarthria altissima), on the soil microbial biomass and
   abiotic parameters, was evaluated in a highly eroded tropical soil of
   the Corozal series (clayey, mixed isohyperthermic Aquic Haplohumults).
   Soil samples were taken monthly at two depths (0- to 5- and 5- to 15-cm)
   from September 1999 to July 2000. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC),
   microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), potentially mineralizable N,
   extractable N, soil organic matter (SOM), and total organic nitrogen
   (TON) were significantly greater under grasses. Microbial pools and
   activities were generally higher at the 0- to 5-cm depth. Soil
   respiration was significantly affected by plant species and date of
   sampling; in general, soils under grasses had the highest values. The
   mean proportions of microbial biomass comprising total organic C and N
   were 2.8 and 1.4\%, respectively, in vegetated soils; higher values for
   C were observed in bare soil. There was a decrease in the mineralizable
   C proportion of MBC (respiratory quotient) with increasing MBC values.
   The lowest respiratory quotients were observed for soils under grasses.
   In this study, soil ecosystem health appears to benefit from vegetation,
   with soils under grasses exhibiting improved stability due to higher
   SOM, TON, biologically active C and N pools and lower relative C losses.}},

Abstract = {{The Agricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution Model (AGNPS) was applied to
   estimate the loads of nitrogen and phosphorus according to antecedent
   soil moisture conditions (AMC) using probable rainfall in a stream
   draining small agricultural watersheds. Calibration and verification of
   the model were performed using observed data collected from rainfall
   events in the Imgo watersheds during 1997-1998. Evaluation of model
   outputs was based on graphical displays contrasting observed and
   simulated values for each rainfall-runoff event, and standard statistics
   such as coefficient of efficiency. The coefficient of efficiency of peak
   flow, total N, and total P in the estimation were 0.97, 0.93, and 0.74,
   respectively. Probable rainfall of Imgo watersheds was computed for
   several return periods using the frequency analysis of Gumbel's extreme
   value distribution. As the probable flood increase, concentrations of
   total N and total P generally decrease. Loss of N and P was proportional
   to the preceding soil water content in the same probable rainfall. The
   excessive fertilization under AMC-III condition can cause relatively
   higher outflow of N and P from the soil. It can be concluded that
   surface runoff and sediment transport influence soil quality and the
   quality of water absorption and AGNPS can provide realistic estimates of
   nonpoint source nutrient yields.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the effect of organic
   farming, in field (OF) and in glass-house (OFG), on selected soil
   biochemical properties compared with conventional farming (CF) in a
   horticultural area characterized by the same climate, soil type and
   topography. Results show that all soil enzyme activities were generally
   higher in OFG compared with OF and CF systems. Because of the different
   conditions of temperature, OFG presented a major loss of organic matter
   too. Catalase activity, metabolic potential (NIP) and biological index
   of fertility (BIF) are suggested as the most suitable soil biological
   indicators for differentiating between organic (OF and OFG) and
   conventional (CF) farming systems. Organic farming systems, because of
   application of organic amendments and less deep tillage, showed a
   greater capacity to improve soil quality as compared with conventional
   production practices. (c) 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Organic rice farming utilized only 33\% (39 USD ha(-1)) of the cash
   capital required to grow a hectare of rice when compared with
   conventional farm which spent 118 USD ha(-1). This much reduced cash
   capital expense in organic rice farming relieved women from the burden
   of sourcing credit to finance crop establishment. Women are in-charge of
   family finances. Cooperation among members of the family (husband, wife,
   children) enabled them to cope with the increased labor requirement of
   organic farming-as in spreading rice straw, preparing and applying
   compost, hand weeding and picking-up golden snails. All organic rice
   farmers who participated in the study were members of farmers
   organization and/or cooperative while only few conventional farmers'
   were members of farmers' organization. Organic farming improved the soil
   quality. The paddy soil was loose and had deeper mud which was
   attributed to the higher soil organic matter (SOM) accumulating as a
   result of crop residue recycling at 3-4 t ha(-1) and animal manure 1-2 1
   ha(-1) crop(-1). Loose and deeper mud led to easier and faster land
   preparation (26 hrs in CF while 16 hrs in OF), and lesser weed growth
   which reduced the labor required in hand weeding and time to do rotary
   weeding. The net revenue in organic farm was higher (332 USD ha(-1))
   than in the conventional farm (290 USD ha(-1)) despite the slightly
   lower yields (3.25 t ha(-1)) in organic compared with the yields
   obtained ( 3.52 t ha(-1)) in the conventional farms. The higher cash
   cost in the conventional farms was due mainly to the agrochemical inputs
   which accounted for 83.2\% of the cash cost (fertilizer, 65\%;
   pesticides, 18.2\%). The fossil fuel based energy inputs (FFEI) in the
   organic farms was only 18.3\% (546.0 Mcal ha(-1)) of the conventional
   farms (2,977.21 Meal ha(-1)). For every 1 cal of fossil fuel energy used
   in the conventional farm, only 4 cal was produced while it was 19 cal in
   the organic farm. Organic farms were less energy consuming. One tonne of
   paddy rice utilized only 170 of FFEI while 844 Mcal in the conventional
   farms. The case Study had shown the socio-economic, energy-use and
   environmental benefits of organic farming over conventional farming.
   Thus, national research and extension program for its promotion and
   widespread adoption by rice farmers in the country should be
   facilitated.}},

Title = {{Economics of poultry manure utilization in land quality improvement
   among integrated poultry-maize-farmers in Southwestern Nigeria}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{21-37}},
Abstract = {{The rapid growth of Nigeria's poultry industry has made it more
   advantageous in terms of providing the essential raw material for
   alternative soil fertility and land quality enhancement than other
   livestock. This paper centres on the use and non-use of poultry manure
   as a land improvement technique for sustainable food production. This is
   achieved by comparing the economic benefits accruable to users and
   non-users of poultry manure among maize farmers in two agroccological
   zones (Guinea Savannah and Rain Forest) in Southwestern Nigeria.
   Data were collected using a structured questionnaire on a sample of 250
   randomly selected maize farmers in each of the agroecological zones.
   Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics and partial
   budget approach of costs and returns analysis.
   Results showed that farmers in the two ecological zones are
   smallholders, with land area grown to maize varying between 0.01 and
   3.00 hectares. Users of poultry manure are mainly integrated
   poultry-maize farm operators who applied poultry manure only on small
   portions (23\% and 27\%, respectively, in the Guinea savannah and rain
   forest zones) of the total cropped area of their farmlands. Respondents
   were fairly literate with a mean age of 43 years for the study area.
   Poultry manure material constituted about 91\% (90\% in the savannah and
   91\% in the forest zone) of the total variable cost of inputs in the
   study area. This is attributed to the bulkiness of manure and the
   distance travelled for its collection. Yield levels (kg/ha) and mean net
   income earnings (N/ha) per annum were significantly higher for users of
   poultry manure. Users recorded 1.35 times and 1.45 times, respectively,
   of non-users' earnings in the savannah and forest zones. Major
   constraints to poultry manure use include: odor, transportation,
   insufficient quantity (scarcity), wetness, bulkiness and not readily
   accessible (hence its search is time consuming), in descending order of
   importance. While odor and transportation were identified as common
   problems among poultry manure users in the guinea savannah and rain
   forest zones, bulkiness was an additional constraint for non-user
   respondents in both zones.
   These imply that use of poultry manure results in higher yield levels
   per unit of land, and is more profitable than its non-use. Poultry
   manure therefore constitutes an important land improvement technique
   capable of enhancing farm production and income levels as results
   generally show that higher profitability is associated with use of
   poultry manure, and this has implications for increased poultry
   production. Thus, farmers and farm operators in the study area should be
   encouraged to keep more birds as integrated enterprises to provide,
   apart from table eggs and chickens, sufficient quantity of poultry
   manure for soil quality improvement and for enhanced crop productivity.
   Technologies aimed at packaging poultry manure in such a way as to
   remove the associated social constraints to its use by farmers also need
   be put in place.}},

Abstract = {{The results of studies of the profitability of alternative cropping
   systems (Organic, Reduced Input, Ridge Till, and No-Till) relative to
   that of conventional systems are compared and analyzed across time,
   location, study type, and crop type. The information collected allowed
   673 separate production cost and profitability comparisons to be made;
   this included 206 direct comparisons of Organic to Conventional, 195
   comparisons of Reduced Input to Conventional, 74 comparisons of Ridge
   Till to Conventional, and 198 comparisons of No-Till to Conventional.
   Study type (farm vs. research experiment station) plays a major role in
   the economic comparison of all alternative cropping systems. Time period
   also seemed to play a role, as Reduced Input and Organic production
   systems compare less favorably with their Conventional counterparts in
   recent (1986-1999) studies relative to studies conducted prior to 1985.
   The largest determinant was found to be the crop type, as some crops,
   such as eggplant, seemed to do well only with Conventional production
   while others, such as citrus fruits, did much better organically.}},

   water and using this source for irrigation can be an important
   consideration when its disposal is being planned in and and semi-arid
   regions. On the other hand, usage of municipal wastewater for irrigation
   needs special management in order to avoid environmental and health
   hazards. With regards to health problems, it is very important to
   generate minimum contact between the effluent and people or the aerial
   parts of the plants. For this purpose, treated secondary municipal
   wastewater of Isfahan plant was used to five irrigation treatments.
   These treatments were:furrow irrigation with normal water (FN), drip
   irrigation with wastewater (DI), sub-surface drip irrigation in 15cm
   depth with wastewater (SDI15), sub-surface drip irrigation in 30cm depth
   with wastewater (SDI30), furrow irrigation with wastewater (FW). The
   results of this research show that the application of DI and SDI sand
   filters caused a decrease in wastewater index pollution: 50.1\% BOD5,
   98.92\% total count, 97.61\% total coliform, 93.24\% fecal coliform,
   57.14\% nematode, 81\% total nitrogen, 52\% N-NO3, 84\% N-NH4 and 44\%
   total suspended solid. In addition the application of SDI system caused
   a decrease in the. moisture of soil surface, so there was decreased
   total coliform and fecal coliforms in soil surface. The average values
   for these parameters showed no significant difference (5\% level)
   between SDI treatments and FN. The result of this research also showed
   that in the case of SDI due to minimal leaching, prevalence
   contamination (such as N-NO3) is minimized as a result of the usage of
   wastewater in depth and ground water. In addition, in SDI treatments,
   the maximum EC and SAR leaching were observed in 60cm depth whereas in
   the FW this leaching was observed deeper than 90cm.}},

Abstract = {{As the development of specialized production of vegetable in solar green
   house, the problem of continuous cropping obstacle has been occurre, for
   example, the degradation of soil environment, serious plant diseases and
   fall of yield, which intimidated facility vegetables sustainable
   production. In order to determine the soil degradation process, and make
   suggestion for soil rehabilitation in continuous cropping system on
   Loess Plateau in China. The field experiments were conducted in solar
   greenhouse during 2001 similar to 2003 in Yanan, North Shaanxi province
   in China (located in the typical hill - gullied region of the Loess
   Plateau, Longitude E109 degrees 19 ` 23 `', Latitude N36 degrees 51 ` 30
   `', with an elevation of 1010 similar to 1431m). Graft cucumbers, the
   squash root in stead of cucumber root, were planted on 6 of November
   2001, and 26 of October 2002. The soil moisture maintained as relative
   soil water content 80\% similar to 90\% with drip irrigation system. The
   results showed that as continuous cropping years increasing, the
   cucumber fruit productivity increased, but after 4 years continuous
   cropping, the productivity decreased obviously. The reason was soil
   quality degradation. The results indicated that as continuous cropping
   years increasing, the soil N: P: K ratio unreasonable, fungus and
   bacteria increased were main factors of soil degradation. Put forward
   that reasonable rotation is the best measure to rehabilitation soil
   quality, cucumber with corn for green manure, black - bean for green
   manure or planting cowpea, balance fertilization and increment of
   organic manure; soil sterilization.}},

Abstract = {{A coupled dynamic mathematical model has been established to predict
   transient flow and organic pollutant transport in unsaturated soil.
   Solutions to the coupled equations are accomplished by the
   characteristic finite difference method and implicit pressure explicit
   saturation method. The numerical model is used to predict the temporal
   and spatial distribution of contaminant concentrations. Numerical shows
   soil texture has a direct connection with soil leaching height, The
   maximum leaching depth is 60cm in clay soil, whereas for 35cm in sand
   soil. It is mainly because that petroleum pollutant leaching properties
   vary with soil texture which influences total porosity, soil
   permeability and water velocity. Moreover, under certain leakage
   conditions, the saturation caused by petroleum pollutant has a trend of
   increase with time. The leakage of petroleum pollutant to subsurface, it
   will have displacement vertically and horizontally under the pressure of
   weight and capillary pressure, but the direction of its transport and
   migration is vertical as a whole. As pollutant migrate the capillary
   zone, the capillary tension restrict the vertical movement. The
   pollutant must overcome the entrapment pressure of oil-water interface
   before it entering the capillary zone, and pollutant accumulates on the
   top of capillary zone to obtain pressure. The pore pressure of pollutant
   exceeds the entrapment pressure of oil-water interface, it enters
   capillary zone and forms a lens above the groundwater level. It provides
   theory evidence for studying distribution and inclination of organic
   pollutant transport in subsurface environment, and the science evidence

Abstract = {{Effects of changes in land-cover on soil quality parameters in an area
   in northern Ghana were studied. Land-cover changes were derived from
   maps of the study area for 1984, 1992 and 1999. There were no
   significant differences between properties of soils under natural
   vegetation and soils put under cultivation from 1992, but permanently
   cultivated soils (1984 4999) showed significantly lower physical and
   chemical soil properties. Soils recently opened up since 1992 for
   cultivation in the last seven years (i.e. 1992-1999) were found to
   manifest significantly higher contents of organic C, N, Ca, Mg and ECEC
   than those under permanent cultivation, suggesting that continuous
   cropping is responsible for deterioration in soil quality. Minimum
   organic C contents necessary to meet critical levels of selected soil
   quality parameters were estimated. The organic C content of recently
   cultivated soils would need to be increased by about 7 t ha(-1) to
   replenish soil nutrient capital. This calls for a strategy to
   synchronize organic matter management with inorganic fertilizer
   application. Further research is also needed to develop farming systems
   that conserve organic matter and also improve the quality of organic
   matter in the study area. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

   1971 to 2002 the subsided area had reached 6825 hm(2) With the maximum
   depth of 9 m, resulting in many problems such as ground failure, soil
   erosion, drop of soil quality of cultivated land, and deterioration of
   ecological environment. Other environmental problems are solid waste and
   mining drainage. Gangue piles have occupied cultivated land about 94 x
   10(4) m(2), which pollutes the air, soil, and water. A large amount of
   drainage (a total volume of which was 1971.85 x 10(4)t in 2002) led to a
   serious waste of water resource. In this paper the major environmental
   geologic problems such as mining subsidence, pollution by gangue piles

Abstract = {{Since farmers started to cultivate land and deliberately sow seed,
   selection has led to the development of domesticated crops suitable for
   a wide range of agro-ecological and socio-cultural conditions. Based on
   increasing understanding of genetics and genes, new prospects for
   molecular breeding have emerged. Both forward and reverse genetic
   approaches and techniques such as marker-assisted selection and
   introgression, mutation breeding and transformation are now available.
   Increased precision in genetic manipulation promotes the application of
   more targeted breeding strategies to a wider range of traits serving a
   broader range of objectives. These include enhanced prospects for
   multifunctional land-use with improvements in the efficient use of
   inputs such as nitrogen, phosphate and water; in soil quality and
   protection against erosion; in pest and disease resistance; in enhanced
   animal nutrition and improved livestock product quality; in reduced
   pollution risks and health problems; and in potential for alternative

Abstract = {{Sanborn Field, an agricultural demonstration field at the University of
   Missouri-Columbia, has over 100 years of cropping histories and
   management practices implemented at this site. We examined the effect of
   these cropping systems and management practices on earthworm populations
   and microbial activity. A field experiment was conducted to characterize
   and quantify earthworms and to determine the microbial activity in the
   same selected plots. We sampled 14 plots at the site, six of which were
   the original plots established in 1888 with the same cropping histories
   and management, and eight of which had been modified over the years to
   accommodate changing farmer needs and scientific questions. Earthworms
   and soil samples were collected in the spring and fall of 1999.
   Aporrectodea tropezoides, Aporrectodea caliginosa, and Lumbricus
   terrestris were the dominant species found in this field. Lumbricus
   terrestris was commonly associated with the no-tillage plot at Sanborn
   Field. Due partly to soil moisture conditions, most of the species were
   found and identified during the spring. Microbial activity, as expected,
   was greatest during the spring. Manure, no-tillage and crop rotations
   that include legumes had the greatest earthworm abundance and microbial
   activity. In general, where no fertility treatments were added to soil
   or where food sources were lacking, earthworm abundance decreased
   significantly. The abundance of earthworms found in this field reflected
   the cropping history and management practices used recently and within
   the last 100 years. In most cases, microbial activity showed similar
   trends as earthworm density. However, some dynamic microbial
   transformations, like nitrification, do not always follow the same trend
   as potential soil quality biotic indicators. Earthworms, along with
   microbial activity, may serve as useful soil quality indicators in
   sustained and short-term field trials. (C) 2003 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{Brown-coal opencast mining provides a virgin soil substratum at a scale
   of square kilometres that is open to primary succession. Focusing on
   this process, we investigated changes in collembolan species composition
   in a long-term study that lasted almost 40 years (1960-1998) at mine
   sites, afforested with deciduous trees. The geological overburden, which
   characterises the soil quality, consisted mainly of Pleistocene and
   Tertiary sands, interspersed with lignite and dark Tertiary loam and
   clay.
   According to their appearance during the primary succession, we
   established eight colonising groups, representing 90 of 113 species
   found. Results from soil samples as well as from pitfall traps were
   taken into account for the definition of the groups. Thus, edaphic and
   epedaphic life forms were equally regarded. Generally, ``initial{''},
   ``pioneer{''} and ``woodland{''} groups were discernible.
   Largest changes in species composition occurred during the first ten
   years, as indicated by decreasing species turnover rates and increasing
   alpha diversity. A comparison with other (essentially shorter) studies
   on Collembola of mine sites (12 in Europe, 3 in other parts of the
   world) showed that some pioneer species are cosmopolitan whilst others
   seem to be regionally specific. Important events in the ecosystem
   development of mine sites, as indicated by the collembolan community,
   are the first occurrence of other humiphagous soil animal groups,
   especially that of earthworms, followed by a disappearance of the
   ectohumus layer. The similarity between collembolan communities of mine
   sites and of adjacent native woodlands is greatest ten years after
   afforestation. Fifty years after afforestation, the collembolan
   community still differed markedly from that of native stands. Thus, a
   gradual development of the mine site collembolan communities to a
   comparable native woodland community is not evident from the data. (C)

Abstract = {{Based on a 20-year fertilization experiment with wheat-maize double
   cropping system, the effects of different long-term fertilization
   treatments on leaf photosynthetic characteristics and grain yield in
   different winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars were studied in
   the growing seasons of 2000-2001 and 2001-2002. A total of nine
   fertilization treatments were implemented, i.e. no fertilizer (CK), N
   fertilizer (N), N and P fertilizers (NP), N and K fertilizers (NK), N,
   P, and K fertilizers (NPK), only organic manure (M), organic manure and
   N fertilizer (MN), organic manure and N and P fertilizers (MNP), and
   organic manure and N, P, and K fertilizers (MNPK). With the treatments
   of combined organic manure and inorganic fertilizers (TMI), net
   photosynthetic rate (P-N), maximal activity of photosystem 2, PS2
   (F-v/F-m), and chlorophyll content (SPAD value) of flag leaves and leaf
   area index (LAI) were much higher at the mid grain filling stage (20 or
   23 d post anthesis, DPA), and exhibited slower declines at the late
   grain filling stage (30 DPA), compared with the treatments of only
   inorganic fertilizers (TI). The maximal canopy photosynthetic traits
   expressed as P-N x LAI and SPAD x LAI at the mid grain filling stage
   were also higher in TMI than those in TI, which resulted in different
   grain yields in TMI and TI. Among the treatments of TMI or among the
   treatments of TI, both flag leaf and canopy photosynthetic abilities and
   yield levels increased with the supplement of inorganic nutrients (N, P,
   and K fertilizers), except for the treatment of NK. Under NK, soil
   contents of N and K increased while that of P decreased. Hence the
   unbalanced nutrients in soil from the improper input of nutrients in NK
   treatment were probably responsible for the reduced flag leaf and canopy
   photosynthetic characteristics and LAI, and for the fast declining of
   flag leaf photosynthetic traits during grain filling, resulting in the
   reduced yield of NK similar to the level of CK.}},

Title = {{Intraspecific variation in growth, defense and herbivory in Dialium
   guianense (Caesalpiniaceae) mediated by edaphic heterogeneity}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Based on resource allocation theory, a negative correlation is predicted
   between resource availability and plant defense against herbivore
   attack. Plants growing in resource-limited environments should display
   lower growth and higher defense against herbivores than plants growing
   where resources are less limited. Interspecific comparisons generally
   support these predictions. We evaluated this hypothesis at the
   intraspecific level, for two sapling populations of the canopy tree
   Dialium guianense (Caesalpiniaceae) at the Lacandona rain forest in
   southeast Mexico. The two populations occur in nearby sites, adjacent to
   the Chajul Field Station, under the same climatic conditions and within
   the same vegetation type, but with considerable differences in soil
   quality. The Floodplain site, under the influence of the Lacantun River,
   has favorable conditions for plant growth, in terms of nutrient and
   water availability, whereas the Hills site, given its location and soil
   characteristics, provides more restricted conditions for plant growth.
   Plants in the Floodplain site had higher growth and lower concentration
   of phenolic compounds than plants in the Hills (a two-fold difference in
   leaf area production, 1.3 less total phenolics). These differences were
   correlated with differences in herbivore attack, as saplings from the
   Hills, with a higher defensive potential, had lower average levels of
   herbivory than Floodplain plants (3.86\% +/- 0.80 vs. 7.75\% +/- 1.43 of
   leaf area loss). The relationship between the concentration of phenolic
   compounds and leaf quality for herbivores was consistent with preference
   assays carried out under laboratory conditions using two species of
   generalist herbivores, the army worm Spodoptera fugiperda and the native
   katydid Orophus sp. In 63.8 and 81.3\% of the cases, third-instar larvae
   of S. fugiperda and adults of Orophus, respectively, preferred leaflets
   from the Floodplain plants population. Moreover, on average, the adults
   of Orophus consumed 2.9 times more leaf area from the Floodplain than
   from the Hills. In addition, a reciprocal transplant experiment
   indicated that phenotypic plasticity is likely to be the mechanism by
   which the plants expressed differential growth and traits affecting
   herbivory levels. In this experiment, growth and herbivory levels were
   1.6 and 1.7 times higher, respectively, in plants transplanted into a
   Floodplain experimental plot than those in a Hills plot. This work
   contributes to our understanding of how edaphic heterogeneity can
   determine intraspecific variation in the relationship of plants with
   their herbivores and evaluates the underlying mechanisms promoting such
   influence.}},

Abstract = {{As a potential means of monitoring functional properties of plantations
   of Pinus pinaster and Pinus radiata established as part of land
   rehabilitation in the wheatbelt of Western Australia, we examined
   aspects of the ecophysiology of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with
   tree roots. A single species of ectomycorrhizal fungi, Rhizopogon
   roseolus, dominated the mycorrhizal flora. Sporocarps of Rhizopogon
   roseolus appeared with the onset of winter rains in May, increased in
   number and total biomass to peak in September, and decreased to
   negligible levels at the beginning of the summer drought in December. A
   greater number of sporocarps, and consequently a greater biomass of
   sporocarp tissue, was associated with roots of P. radiata than P.
   pinaster. A similar seasonal pattern of rnycorrhizal root infection was
   determined by counts of individual ectomycorrhizal root tips from
   bimonthly collection of soil core samples. At the low rainfall (380 mm
   annually) site, greater numbers of live root tips were more strongly
   correlated with soil moisture than organic matter content of soil. In
   contrast, in wetter areas closer to Perth (800 mm annually), highest
   numbers of active root tips and greatest amounts of organic matter were
   both within 0-10 cm depths. Results suggest an overriding importance of
   soil moisture rather than nutrient status of the soil as the key
   determinant of spatial and temporal distribution of the fungus. Results
   from a range of assays determining enzyme activity of soil (protease,
   phosphomonoesterase, cellulase, L-asparaginase, L-glutaminase and
   beta-glucosidase) Surrounding mycorrhizal roots indicated seasonal
   patterns to be similar to those described for reproductive activity of
   mycorrhizal fungi. Factors responsible for patterns of seasonal activity
   and distribution of ectomycorrhizal roots are discussed in terms of
   managing systems in order to maximise tree growth and form while
   effectively restoring soil water balance.}},

Abstract = {{Soil chemistry, soil microbial biomass and mineralization rate of
   organic matter (OM) were estimated on plots, which were set up in Scots
   pine and Norway spruce forests in southern Poland. The aim of the study
   was to assess the relations between soil microbial biomass and chemical
   parameters associated with soil fertility. The size of microbial biomass
   was found to be significantly correlated with chemical parameters
   reflecting soil nutritional status (content of base cations cation
   exchange capacity, base saturation) and organic matter quality (Coo to
   macronutrients ratios). In addition, soil microbial biomass appeared to
   be strongly correlated with OM mineralization rate. These findings point
   out a distinct relationship between soil fertility and soil microbial
   biomass, suggesting that microbial biomass measurements provide a valid
   estimate of soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Within the framework of the development of an indicator for the
   ecological quality of soil, the composition of fauna in Dutch soils is
   being determined in relation to abiotic conditions and land use type.
   One of the species groups being investigated is that of the nematodes.
   This has resulted so far in a database with data derived from more than
   300 sites. In this contribution, the set-up of the indicator system and
   the monitoring activities are described, and some results of the survey
   are shown. It can be seen that there is enough discriminative power to
   use the composition of the communities within the indicator to
   discriminate between different combinations of land use and soil type.
   It is shown that an increase in agricultural intensity results in a
   decrease of species numbers and abundance of nematodes. Furthermore, the
   use of data derived for prognostic applications is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental sanitation comprises disposal and treatment of human
   excreta, solid waste and wastewater, control of disease vectors, and
   provision of washing facilities for personal and domestic hygiene. The
   conventional approach to environmental sanitation is characterised by a
   linear waste management system, where valuable plant nutrients are often
   not only wasted, but also create pollution problems in receiving waters.
   Closing the nutrient loop is one of the main objectives of a more
   ecological approach to environmental sanitation. Reuse of wastewater and
   organic waste in urban agriculture may contribute to closing this
   nutrient loop. In addition to food security and income generation, urban
   agricultural activities can thus help to improve public health and
   resource management. However, some urban agricultural processes, such as
   ``agricultural practices{''}, ``soil quality management{''} and
   ``irrigation{''}, still requires further research.}},

Abstract = {{For testing phytotoxicity many methods have been developed. In this
   experiment some methods are compared. Tests with development of cucumber
   cotyledons, luminescence of bacteria, growth of duckweed and root growth
   of germinating seeds of kohlrabi and garden cress are compared. All
   tests were suitable but the bioassay where development of cucumber
   cotyledons is determined and the luminescence of bacteria were the most
   practicable. The different bioassays give comparable results but they
   cannot always be converted directly. The different bioassays can be used
   when in a short time results are needed or when experience has learned
   that e.g. phytotoxic substances can be expected from a certain
   production process. For a more robust general bioassay an adapted
   version of ISO 11269-2 (1995) standard for testing the soil quality
   looks promising, although the adaptations still have to be tested.}},

Abstract = {{The Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) was initiated as a
   result of the large amount of funding (\$2 billion-U.S.) for
   conservation programs in the Food Security Act of 2002, also known as
   the 2002 Farm Bill. The U.S. public, the Congress, and many others are
   asking questions about the effectiveness of these conservation
   expenditures and their results in terms of environmental benefits and
   effects. The primary focal points are the quality of soil and water and
   the conservation of water, but additional studies are planned to
   determine effects of conservation practices on air quality,
   environmental habitat, carbon sequestration, and other effects and
   benefits. There are two major components to the project. The first is
   the National Assessment, which will provide estimates of conservation
   benefits at the national scale for annual reporting. The National
   Assessment will use new and existing National Resources Inventory data
   and field and watershed scale models to generate national reports about
   the numbers and kinds of practices installed, as well as their costs and
   environmental outcomes. The second major component of the project is the
   Watershed Assessment Studies, which will provide in selected watersheds
   more detailed assessments of environmental effects and benefits than are
   possible at the national scale, provide a framework for evaluating and
   improving the performance of the national assessment models, and provide
   additional research on conservation practices and their expected effects
   at the watershed scale. This paper describes the project and the two
   major components, with emphasis on the analytical tools being employed,
   and specific studies ongoing in research watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{There are more population but less cultivated land in Pearl River
   estuary region, South China. The commissariat provision isnit enough in
   the region for a long time. The distribution of acid sulphate soil (ASS)
   is in constant changing for the Pearl River delta expands seaward. It is
   important to research the ASS for land use planning and crop
   potentiality appraising in Pearl River estuary. As more than 20 years
   have passed since the soil type maps and reports of the 2nd national
   soil investigation were given, there appear some soil quality problems.
   The problems can be solved by the modem remote sensing and GIS
   techniques. The ASS units are updated by the analysis of the new remote
   sensing images and the application of digital elevation model (DEM). The
   change of ASS area is also produced by GIS. Finally, a practical
   distribution of ASS is presented in map. The authors find out that the
   result of remote sensing \& GIS methods is of high reliability and
   spatial conclusiveness by comparing the result data with the past
   investigation report of soil and some field exploration data.}},

Abstract = {{In soils with naturally favorable characteristics for cultivation,
   conventional tillage degrades the physical soil properties, since this
   management system causes the rupture of aggregates, soil compaction, and
   eliminates soil cover. No-tillage, on the other hand, maintains soil
   cover and improves physical properties, but consolidates the surface
   layer. Our study was conducted on a Haplumbrept soil, from May 1995 to
   April 2001. Five soil tillage treatments were used: conventional tillage
   crop rotation (CTR), conventional tillage crop succession (CTS),
   no-tillage crop rotation (NTR), no-tillage crop succession (NTS), and
   natural pasture (NP), in four replications each. The crop sequences were
   bean/fallow/maize /fallow/soybean/fallow in CTR,
   maize/fallow/maize/fallow/maize/fallow in CTS,
   bean/oat/maize/turnip/soybean/vetch in NTR and
   maize/vetch/maize/vetch/maize/ vetch in NTS. Soil density,
   macroporosity, microporosity, total porosity, organic carbon, and water
   aggregate stability (MWD) were evaluated in April 2001 for the soil
   layers 0-2.5, 2.5-5, 5-10,10-15,15-20, and 20-30 cm. In the 0-10 cm
   layer, soil density was higher in no-tillage than conventional tillage
   and natural pasture, while macroporosity, total porosity, and the
   macroporosity/total porosity relation was higher in conventional tillage
   in the mean for cropping systems in this layer. Organic carbon, MWD, and
   sensibility index for MWD means of layers and tillage systems were
   higher in no-tillage and natural pasture than in conventional tillage.}},

Abstract = {{The initial growth response of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) to
   competition control is well documented. However, the benefits of
   competing vegetation to soil quality have not been thoroughly
   investigated. A study was conducted: (i) to evaluate the effectiveness
   of bedding site preparation in recovering soil processes and
   productivity following disturbance; and (ii) to determine if different
   levels of vegetation control have differential effects on soil processes
   that aid in the recovery and maintenance of soil productivity. Study
   plots were established on a wet pine flat on South Carolina's Coastal
   Plain. Treatments included a range of three disturbance classes
   (undisturbed, compression tracked, and churned), two site preparation
   treatments (flat planted and bedded), and a gradient of vegetation
   control (no vegetation control, operational level weed control, and
   complete weed control). Compacted soils generally increased in bulk
   density (14\%) and decreased in macroporosity (25\%) and hydraulic
   conductivity (69\%) compared with undisturbed treatments. Churning had
   no significant net effect on the soil physical properties measured;
   however, it did increase net N mineralization by over 100\% on
   flat-planted treatment plots. Bedding fully ameliorated the effects of
   soil compaction based on the physical properties measured. Trends
   suggest some improvements in soil quality with increasing levels of
   non-crop vegetation biomass; however, during 2 yr of operational
   vegetation control, the beneficial effects of the non-crop vegetation
   were marginal.}},

Abstract = {{In the Amazon basin, tropical rainforest is being slashed and burned at
   accelerated rates for annual crops over a couple of years, followed by
   forage grasses. Because of poor management, the productivity of
   established pastures declines in a few years so that grazing plots are
   abandoned and new areas are deforested. Previous studies in the region
   report higher bulk density in soils under pasture than in similar soils
   under forest. The objective of this study was to detect changes in the
   physical quality of the topsoil of nutrient-poor Typic Paleudults in the
   colonisation area of Guaviare, Colombian Amazonia, and analyse the
   effect of soil deterioration on pasture performance. Temporal variation
   of soil compaction under pasture was analysed by comparing natural
   forest taken as control and pasture plots of Brachiaria decumbens
   (Stapf) grouped into three age ranges (<3, 3-9, >9 years). Evidence of
   soil compaction through cattle trampling, after clearing the primary
   forest, included the formation of an Ap horizon with platy structure and
   dominant greyish or olive colours, reflecting impaired surface drainage,
   the increase of bulk density and penetration resistance, and the
   decrease of porosity and infiltration rate. From primary forest to
   pastures older than 9 years, bulk density of the 5-10 cm layer increase
   was 42\% in fine-textured soils and 30\% in coarse-textured soils.
   Penetration resistance ranged from 0.45 MPa under forest to 4.25 MPa in
   old pastures, with maximum values occurring at 3-12 cm depth in pastures
   older than 9 years. Average total soil porosity was 58-62\% under forest
   and 46-49\% under pasture. Basic infiltration dropped from 15 cm h(-1)
   in the original forest conditions to less than 1 cm h(-1) in old
   pastures. Crude protein content and dry matter yield of the forage grass
   steadily decreased over time. No clear relationship between declining
   protein content as a function of pasture age and changes in chemical
   soil properties was found, but there was a high negative correlation (r
   = -0.81) between protein content and bulk density, reflecting the effect
   of soil compaction on pasture performance. After about 9-10 years of
   use, established grass did no longer compete successfully with invading
   weeds and grazing plots were abandoned. As land is not yet a scarcity in
   this colonisation area, degraded pastures are seldom rehabilitated. (C)

Abstract = {{Although it is widely recognized by researchers who study agricultural
   production systems that evaluating the sustainability of these systems
   is vital, few studies of this nature have been published. One difficulty
   may be in defining what constitutes sustainability and how it should be
   measured, while another may be in networking with the necessary
   multi-disciplinary research team to carry out this type of study.
   Nevertheless, the study of agricultural production systems is important
   to the sustainability of farms, rural communities, and society because
   these studies compare actual farming systems, revealing their strengths
   and weaknesses. Using the recent study on the sustainability of organic,
   integrated, and conventional apple production systems in Washington
   State, USA, as an example, we will address the following critical
   questions about evaluating sustainability and how research networking
   fits into this scientific approach: What constitutes a whole system's
   approach to studying sustainability in horticultural production systems?
   What are the characteristics of a successful study of horticultural
   production systems? Why aren't more studies of horticultural production
   systems performed or reported in the literature? What are the future
   directions of research on horticultural production systems?}},

Abstract = {{The carry-over effects from one year to the next of surface residue and
   tillage management decisions on runoff and erosion are not clear The
   dynamics of runoff and erosion processes during rainfall events are
   likely dependent on the tillage and residue management system. The
   objective of this study was to elucidate the effects of tillage
   practices and residue management, by removal of residue cover on the
   properties that describe the dynamics of the runoff and erosion
   processes. Six-row, 12.2 m long x 5.5 m wide, plots under conventional
   tillage (CT) or no tillage (NT) corn (Zea mays L.) for nine years were
   used in this study. Plots had an average slope of 5.7\% on a Grenada
   silt loam (Glossic Fragiudalf) soil. Rainfall simulations were conducted
   on a 10.7 m x 3.7 m area within each plot at a rate of 65 mm h(-1) for 1
   h under natural antecedent soil-water conditions (dry run),followed by a
   0.5 h simulation 4 h later (wet run), and another 0.5 h application 30
   min later (very wet run). The ten treatments consisted of an incomplete
   2 x 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of two tillage histories (CTh and NTh),
   two tillage levels (tilled and not tilled), and three residue management
   levels (residue left, residue removed just prior to simulated rainfall,
   and residue removed one year prior to simulated rainfall). The missing
   treatments were the NTh-tilled and CTh-not tilled with residue left. The
   time of runoff initiation, maximum runoff rate, flow velocity, and
   maximum sediment concentration were used to describe differences in
   runoff and erosion dynamics. Residue removal resulted in significantly
   sooner runoff with the NT system. There was a significant carry-over
   effect of residue removal with runoff initiated 35\% sooner the
   subsequent year of removal and sediment concentrations increasing by
   >100\%. Maximum sediment concentrations were lower for the CTh land that
   was not tilled than for the tilled despite the untilled land
   experiencing sooner runoff and higher runoff rates. Tilling NTh land
   resulted in significantly lower sediment concentrations than tilling CTh
   land, suggesting that the soil quality of NT was not immediately lost
   when tilled, but these beneficial properties were fully lost within one
   year of residue removal.}},

Abstract = {{Biological nitrogen fixation is a key process allowing the supply of
   this nutrient to many plants belonging to the family Leguminosae. One
   main example of an efficient symbiosis is that between the soybean and
   rhizobial strains belonging to the species of Bradyrhizobium japonicum
   and B. elkanii, that can supply up to 95\% of the crops needs for
   nitrogen. Rhizobial inoculants have been produced for more than 110
   years, and quality of the products commercialized in South America has
   considerably improved over the last decade. The success of the
   biological process with the soybean crop in South America results from
   breeding programs searching for both plant and Bradyrhizobium genotypes
   with higher capacity of N-2 fixation, such that today higher yields are
   obtained in the total absence of N fertilizers. The importance of this
   approach is shown when we consider that in both China, considered as the
   genetic center of soybean, and in USA, where the low cost of N
   fertilizers does not stimulate the search for efficient symbiotic
   partners, the rates of N 2 fixation are far below from those reported in
   South America. In South America increases in yield due to inoculation
   are verified even in soils with a high population of soybean
   bradyrhizobia, thus the commercialization of inoculants reaches about 25
   million doses per year in the main producing countries. The economy
   related to the biological process with soybean grown in Brazil is
   estimated at U\$ 2.87 billion per year, and similar results are reported
   for Argentina, therefore growers need both to maintain their focus on N
   2 fixation as an economic N source for this crop, and to ensure that
   land quality is maintained or improved by continued study of soil
   quality and the factors affecting it.}},

Abstract = {{Spotted knapweed is an invasive mycorrhizal weed prevalent in the
   Pacific Northwest of the United States. Little is known about the
   effects of spotted knapweed or its management methods on soil quality
   and soil structure. This study compared soils from spotted
   knapweed-infested areas with areas where spotted knapweed is being
   managed using several herbicides and mechanical treatments. We measured
   concentrations of glomalin, a glycoprotein produced by arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), that is correlated with soil aggregate
   stability, AMF hyphal length, and percent water-stable aggregates (WSA)
   in soils from managed and unmanaged areas. Areas with high knapweed
   density (unmanaged areas) generally had lower glomalin concentrations
   and AMF hyphal lengths compared with areas receiving chemical and
   combined mechanical-chemical management treatments. Total glomalin was
   significantly negatively correlated with percent knapweed cover.
   However, WSA was high (70 to 80\%) in soils from all management
   treatments and was not affected by knapweed cover. Our results suggest
   that spotted knapweed does not have negative effects on soil quality
   from our study site, likely because of the high aggregate stability of
   the soils in the area. However, Centaurea maculosa may have negative
   effects on soil quality in soils with lower aggregate stability.}},

Abstract = {{Soils in New Zealand, and elsewhere, often contain substantial zones of
   ferro-manganese concretions and pans (laterally continuous layers) that
   can affect soil quality and management. Soils containing concretions and
   pans from Southland, New Zealand, were investigated to determine links
   between microbial ecology and geochemistry. Three soil profiles were
   sampled at 100-mm intervals to a depth of 1 in and then assayed for nine
   different populations of bacteria using selective media. Geochemical
   analysis was performed on the soils at the same intervals, and on
   shallow groundwater from nearby wells. The largest concentrations of
   iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) coincide with concretions. Nitrogen (N) and
   carbon (C) are not correlated with Fe and Mn but may be depleted due to
   bacterial metabolism. Fe and Mn concentrations in groundwater are low,
   suggesting that the source of these elements in the concretions and pans
   is in situ weathering rather than groundwater. Numbers of iron oxidising
   organisms increase where concretions and pans are encountered, but
   manganese-oxidising organisms decrease. Heterotrophic,
   sulphur-oxidising, and anaerobic populations have relatively consistent
   numbers at all depths within the profiles. Fifty organisms were selected
   for phylogenetic characterisation, of which only Pseudomonas sp. is
   known to have significant interactions with Fe and Mn. These results
   suggest a link between concretion development and iron-oxidising
   microbial populations.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulation of heavy metals in agricultural soils may cause serious
   problems for soil quality, groundwater and food chains. Based on the
   databases of the Swiss agricultural statistics and on data from
   experimental farms, we modelled regional-scale mass balances of
   phosphorus (P), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) and their uncertainties for a
   large number of arable and dairy farms in the northwest of Switzerland
   using the model PROTERRA-S. Large differences in P fertilization
   characteristics between these farm types were found. Crop demand for P
   on arable farms were primarily met through additions of inorganic
   fertilizers and sewage sludge, while on dairy farms the largest P input
   was provided by animal manure. Average model calculations predicted an
   enrichment between 0.8 and 1.9 g ha(-1) per year for Cd and between 76
   and 525 g ha(-1) per year for Zn for soils of arable and dairy farms,
   respectively. Hence, according to our analyses, current agricultural
   land use is not sustainable in terms of soil quality standards.
   Predicted accumulation of Cd in soil was larger for arable crops than
   for grassland, while the opposite was true for Zn. Analyzing scenarios
   of changes in P fertilization management showed that Cd and Zn
   enrichment in soil was more sensitive to decreasing net P inputs to
   arable farms than to dairy farms. When uncertainty of input data was
   taken into account, large variances of the calculated accumulation rates
   were found. Coefficient of variation of the net fluxes ranged between 56
   and 162\% for Cd, and between 46 and 82\% for Zn, and distribution
   functions of the net fluxes indicated that in some soils, particularly
   under grassland, also a depletion of Zn and Cd may occur. Hypothetical
   steady-state soil concentrations of Cd were estimated to exceed average
   soil threshold concentration on arable farms, while steady-state Zn
   concentrations in soils of dairy farms were on average below the
   corresponding threshold value. However, if the uncertainty of these Zn
   estimates was considered, a significant part of the distribution
   exceeded the threshold value. The results of our study demonstrate that
   information on variation in element balances is beneficial. Average flux
   balances alone do not provide sufficient information for an adequate
   assessment of sustainable land use. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In volcanic regions, soils containing both noncrystalline materials and
   layer silicates are widespread. Although the respective contribution of
   these components to soil physical behaviours is difficult to quantify,
   it is an important issue in the Canary Islands, where Andisols and andic
   soils are transported to the low lands for cultivation
   ({''}sorriba{''}). In this new soil environment, salinisation and
   sodification processes, induced by irrigation and heavy fertilisation,
   are potential threats to soil degradation. The purpose of this work was
   to evaluate some relevant physical properties of the soniba-cultivated
   volcanic soils from Tenerife in order to relate them to salinity and
   sodicity soil conditions, amounts of layer silicates and remaining andic
   properties, characterised by: bulk density (rho(b)), Al and Fe extracted
   with ammonium oxalate (Al-o, Fe-o) and P retention. An Andisol under
   forest was included in the study as a representative natural reference.
   Clay dispersion, water release curves and saturated hydraulic
   conductivity, K-s, were the selected physical properties.
   Four distinctive types of water release curves were identified, showing
   sandy behaviour at low suctions while retaining large water holding
   capacity at large suctions. The van Genuchten parameters helped to
   differentiate these curves and identify the main pore-size ranges.
   Under certain combinations of exchangeable cations distribution,
   salinity and clay mineralogy, very low K, values were observed for Al-o
   contents lower than 3\%. The results suggest that the aggregating effect

Abstract = {{This case study examines the effects of 6 years of farm dairy effluent
   (FDE) irrigation on the upper 40 cm of a Greytown silt loam, Wairarapa,
   New Zealand. Physical and chemical soil properties were measured, i.e.,
   particle size distribution, porosity, dry bulk density, field-saturated
   hydraulic conductivity, total carbon, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, pH, total
   and Olsen phosphorus, cation exchange capacity, and concentrations of
   exchangeable cations (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+). While the concentrations of
   total carbon and total Kjeldahl nitrogen were generally low at all
   depths, the application of effluent has caused a significant increase in
   their concentrations in the upper 10 cm of the profile. The
   concentration of exchangeable cations has been similarly increased in
   the upper 10 cm of the profile. The soil has very low phosphorus
   retention, however effluent application has increased both total and
   Olsen phosphorus to 40 cm depth. Most of the changes in soil properties
   have led us to believe that current application rates and pasture
   production can be maintained and that FDE application has improved the
   soil's long-term fertility or ``soil quality{''}, especially in the
   upper 10 cm of the profile. However, there is no evidence to suggest
   that current application rates are sustainable in terms of other
   environmental effects (e.g., nitrate leaching).}},

Abstract = {{The rate of development of topsoil is an important characteristic for
   soil resilience and sustainable use. We located a chronosequence (1-59
   yr) of recovering landslip scars in erodible siltstone hill country
   under permanent pasture for sheep farming in New Zealand. We measured
   the rates of recovery in microbial C, respiration, catabolic diversity,
   phosphatase, sulphatase and invertase activities, pH, total C, total N,
   C/N ratio, potentially mineralizable N, total P, Olsen P,
   cation-exchange capacity, bulk density, particle density, porosity,
   available water and aggregate stability (0-10 cm depth). A subset of the
   same sites was sampled again after a 14-yr interval, enabling us to test
   whether rates of change estimated by resampling the same sites were the
   same as those estimated from a single time sample from the
   chronosequence (the space-for-time hypothesis).
   Most topsoil characteristics had recovered to 71-85\% of those in the
   non-slipped sites after 59 yr. Exceptions were soil respiration,
   invertase and sulphatase activities, and bulk density, which recovered
   to 94-110\% of the values of the non-slipped sites. There was little
   change in soil pH, total P, Olsen P, exchangeable cations and water
   storage along the chronosequence. An asymptote model fitted the patterns
   of recovery in biochemical characteristics, organic matter, bulk density
   and particle density. Recovery (to 90\% of the asymptote value) was most
   rapid for the C/N ratio (5 yr) and longest for particle density (79 yr);
   most other characteristics fell in an 18-50 yr range. Overall, a single
   sampling of a chronosequence of matched landslip scars was as reliable
   to estimate rates of recovery as was resampling individual sites through
   time. Total C and N were as effective as more complicated biochemical
   measures to monitor the recovery of topsoil. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Soil management practices affect soil microbial communities, which in
   turn influence soil ecosystem processes. In this study, the effects of
   conventional- (fall disking, chiseling and spring disking, field
   cultivation) and no-tillage practices on soil microbial communities were
   examined under long-term continuous cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)
   systems on a Decatur silt loam soil. Soil samples were taken in
   February, May, and October of 2000 at depths of 0-3, 3-6, 6-12, and
   12-24 cm. Compared to the conventional -till treatment, the no-till
   treatment increased soil organic carbon and total nitrogen contents in
   the surface layer by 130 and 70\%, respectively. Microbial biomass C
   content under no-till treatment was 60, 140, and 75\% greater than under
   conventional -till treatment in February, May, and October,
   respectively. Principal components analysis of phospholipid ester-linked
   fatty acid (PLFA) profile indicated soil microbial communities shifted
   over time and with soil depth. This change appeared to be driven
   primarily by soil bacterial populations as indicated by the major PLFA
   contributors (i.e. fatty acids 16:0, 10Me16:0, cy19:0, 16:1 20H, and
   i15:0) to the first two principal components. Tillage treatment
   differences were revealed by analysis of variance on the first principal
   components (PC 1), which accounted for 62\% of the total sample
   variance, and by the relative abundance of selected PLFAs and PLFA
   ratios. The impact of tillage practices was significant in February and
   May, but not in October. During the growing season, changes in the
   microbial community may be primarily determined by soil conditions
   responding to cotton growth and environmental variables such as moisture
   and temperature; during fallow or prior to cotton establishment,
   community changes associated with tillage practices become more
   pronounced. These findings have implications for understanding how
   conservation tillage practices improve soil quality and sustainability
   in a cotton cropping system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   sugar bect (SB) residue in the presence of rock phosphate and
   mycorrhizal inoculation of seedlings with Pisolithas tinctorius. The aim
   was to improve the physical, chemical, biochemical and biological
   properties of a degraded semiarid Mediterranean soil. Short-term effects
   of such improvements on the establishment of Cistus albidus L. seedlings
   were evaluated. Eight months after planting, macronutrients (NPK), total
   carbohydrates, water-soluble C, water-soluble carbohydrates, microbial
   biomass C and enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, urease, protease, acid
   phosphatase and P-glucosidase) measured in the rhizosphere soil of C.
   albidus were increased greatly by addition of fermented SB residue. Soil
   structural stability improved only with the fermented SB addition (about
   79\% higher in the amended soils than in the non-amended soils). The
   mycorrhizal inoculation was the most effective treatment in improving
   the growth of C. albidus plants, but only slightly improved soil
   quality. Growth of inoculated plants was about 33\% greater than plants
   grown in the amended soil and about 131\% greater than control plants.
   The combined benefit of mycorrhizal inoculation of seedlings and
   addition of fermented SB residue to soil on plant growth was similar to
   that of the treatments applied individually.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock, especially ruminant, production is an important component of
   farming systems in upland areas of the Philippines. Moreover, since
   upland agriculture is becoming unsustainable because of soil erosion and
   productivity of crops is limited by poor soils, livestock production is
   a particularly valuable source of income to complement crop production.
   Farmers rely heavily on livestock to provide a source of savings, cash
   income, draft power and nutritious food. Nevertheless, scarcity and poor
   quality of feed are major constraints to improved livestock productivity
   in upland areas. Introduction of planted forages in these systems has
   the potential to increase substantially the quality and quantity of
   available forages, thus providing fodder to supplement low-quality
   naturally occurring forages and crop residues; concurrently, forage
   plants promote sustainability by improving soil quality and reducing
   soil erosion.
   Adoption of forages by smallholder farmers in the rainfed upland areas
   of the Philippines is conditioned by the dual-purpose role of forage
   plants. A number of forage species have been used as contour hedgerow
   species for the reduction of soil erosion. These include Gliricidia
   sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Setaria spp., napier grass (Pennisetum
   purpureum) and vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides). These species were
   chosen as hedgerow species because of their value as fodder for
   livestock, in addition to their roles in reducing soil erosion,
   controlling weed growth, and improving and stabilising fallow areas.
   A number of constraints affect the widespread adoption of forages for
   use as hedgerow species by smallholder farmers in the Philippine
   uplands. These factors include: the limited availability of seed; high
   mortality amongst the forage species planted; a lack of collective
   action; and the high initial cost of investment. Insufficient attention
   has been given to policy and socio-economic factors affecting adoption
   of forages. For example, the effects of socio-economic factors such as
   human capital (education, age), income and access to institutions (e.g.
   credit and extension) have not been studied in association with the
   adoption of forage species. Therefore, policy and technology options to
   address these issues are warranted.
   This paper uses an econometric approach (i.e. probit) to identify the
   factors affecting adoption of forages by smallholder fanners in the
   upland areas of the Philippines, using data from a survey conducted in
   1996 by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The survey
   examined farmers who had adopted contour hedgerow technology at 2 upland
   sites, Cebu, Visayas and Claveria, Mindanao, the Philippines.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding of the characteristics of soil organic matter (SOM) and
   soil nutrients at the field and catchment scale is important for
   refining agricultural management practices and for improving sustainable
   land use. In order to analyze on SOM and nutrient differences among
   different land use types and their relationships between land use,
   landscape position and slope aspect, 94 sampling sites including 7 land
   uses were selected along 6 transects in the Danangou catchment with an
   area of 3.5 km(2) on the Loess Plateau of China. Significant differences
   in SOM, total N (TN), available N (AN) and available P (AP) among these
   land uses were found.. Higher values in SOM, TN and AN were measured in
   soils from woodland and grassland, but lower values in the soils from
   fallow land and cropland. Compare SOM and TN with cropland,
   intercropping land had high contents. The adjusted R-2 values of
   regression models for SOM and nutrients with land use, landscape
   position and slope aspect ranged from 0.501 (SOM) to 0.134 (AP). A
   comparison between average predicted and measured values for SOM and
   each soil nutrient revealed that the predicted values in TP and AN for
   each land use, in SOM and TN except for fallow land and in AP except for
   intercropping land, shrub land and woodland, fell with in a 95\%
   confidence interval about the measured values. The simplified predicted
   models of soil nutrients combined with the key value of SOM for soil
   quality can serve to improve agricultural practices and to provide
   useful information on sustainable land use. Improvement in SOM and
   nutrients would be expected from more C inputs including manure and crop
   residues and alternative cultivation practices such as developing
   intercropping system, building terrace for soil and water conservation,
   return the cropland with SOM content less than a key value of 0.44\% to
   the grassland and woodland on the hilly areas similar to the Loess
   Plateau of China. At the same time, it is recommended that nitrogen
   fertilization addition could be decreased in the foot slope and
   increased on the upper slope. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An appreciation of the dynamism of the links between soil resources and
   society provides a platform for examining food security over the next 50
   years. Interventions to reverse declining trends in food security must
   recognize the variable resilience and sensitivity of major tropical soil
   types. In most agroecosystems, declining crop yield is exponentially
   related to loss of soil quality. For the majority smallholder
   (subsistence) farmers, investments to reverse degradation are primarily
   driven by private benefit, socially or financially. ``Tragedy of the
   commons{''} scenarios can be averted by pragmatic local solutions that
   help farmers to help themselves.}},

   uses census-tract level data for the Brazilian Amazon to relate forest
   conversion and pasture productivity to precipitation, soil quality,

   protection status. The probability that land is used for agriculture or
   intensively stocked with cattle declines markedly with increasing

Abstract = {{The objective of our study was to assess the response of physical
   (aggregate stability and bulk density) and biological (enzyme activities
   and microbial biomass) soil quality indicators to the adoption of
   agroecological management practices, such as the planting of forage
   species (forage area) and the rotation of local crops (polycrop area),
   carried out in a representative tropical pasture on an integrated
   livestock-crop farm. The pasture system was used as control (pasture
   area). In all three areas, the values of water-soluble C were higher in
   the rainy season compared to the dry season. Pasture and forage areas
   had the highest percentage of stable aggregates in the rainy season,
   while polycrops developed soils with less stable aggregates. Soil bulk
   density was lower in the pasture and forage areas than in the polycrop
   area. In the pasture area, the microbial biomass C values,
   dehydrogenase, urease, protease-BAA, acid phosphatase, and
   beta-glucosidase activities were higher than in the forage and polycrop
   areas, particularly in the dry season. The highest increase in the
   microbial biomass C in the rainy season, with respect to the dry season,
   was recorded in the pasture area (about 1.2-fold). In conclusion, the
   planting of forage species can be considered an effective practice for
   carrying out sustainable, integrated livestock-crop systems, due to its
   general maintenance of soil quality, while the adoption of polycrop
   rotations appears to be less favorable because it decreases soil
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{No-till management is generally preferred over conventional tillage,
   especially in fine-textured soils where tillage can increase soil
   compaction, disrupt the natural structure formation process, and have
   long lasting effects on soil quality. The objective of this project was
   to quantify the interactive and residual effects of different tillage
   systems on the water transmission and structural properties of Kokomo
   silty clay loam (fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiaquoll). Soil
   physical properties were assessed at the Don Scott experimental farm of
   the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, 9 years after initiating the
   study and 20 months after the last tillage operation. Three tillage
   treatments were replicated four times: moldboard plow (MB), chisel plow
   (CP), and no-till (NT). Tillage operations took place during the fall of
   each year between 1993 and 2000, and soil samples for physical property
   assessment were obtained during summer 2002 for 0-10- and 10-20-cm
   depths. The water infiltration tests conducted on each of the 12
   experimental plot showed that the highest cumulative infiltration (1, 90
   cm) and steady state infiltration (i(c), 27 cm h(-1)) were for the NT
   treatment and varied in the order NT > CP similar to MB. Soil bulk
   density (rho(b)) varied in the order MB > NT similar to CP, available
   water capacity (AWC) and air filled porosity (f(a)) NT > MB similar to
   CP. The water stable aggregation (WSA) (943 g kg(-1)) and the volume of
   transmission (TrP) (0.10 cm(3)cm(- 3)) and storage pores (StP) (0.31
   cm(3)cm(-3)) were the highest for the NT plots for 0-10-cm depth. For
   the 10-20-cm depth, the WSA and MWD were in the order NT > MB similar to
   CP; AWC-NT (2.00 cm) similar to CP (1.71 cm) > MB (1.36 cm). Tillage
   effects on soil properties between MB and CP seemed to diminish at the
   end of the growing season, and the infiltration rate after 5 min, i(c),
   I, WSA; and soil rho(b) values were similar. Canonical correlation
   analysis indicated strong association between volumes of StP and I, i(c)
   and soil rho(b), and SOC and soil rho(b).}},

Abstract = {{The use of no-tillage has notably increased in the Pampas region of
   Argentina during the last 10 yr. Two tillage experiments with
   contrasting previous agricultural use, degraded and non-degraded soils,
   were evaluated in the southeast of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. The
   objectives were to: (i) quantify the effects of tillage and N
   fertilization on quantity and vertical distribution of C and N in the
   soil organic matter (SOM) and particulate organic matter (POM) fractions
   as well as potentially mineralizable N (PMN), and (ii) evaluate these
   fractions as indicators of soil quality. Tillage systems were
   conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT), and no-tillage (NT)
   (main plots), and N fertilization rates were 0, 120, and 150 kg ha(-1)
   (subplots). Total organic C (TOC), total N (TN), POM-C, POM-N, and PMN
   were measured at 0- to 7.5- and 7.5- to 15-cm soil depth. In Exp. I
   (degraded soil) TOC was greater under NT (27 g kg(-1)) than under CT (24
   g kg(-1)) in the 0-N treatments. No differences in TOC and TN were found
   in Exp. II at 0 to 7.5 cm (non-degraded soil). Carbon in POM and POM-N
   were greater under NT in the fractions of 2112 to 2000 and 53 to 212 mum
   at 0 to 7.5 cm, but they were similar or greater under CT at 7.5- to
   15-cm depth in Exp. I. Stratification of TOC, TN, and POM were observed
   under NT in Exp. I. Potentially mineralizable N was greater under NT (62
   mg kg(-1)) in Exp. I, however, no differences in PMN were observed in
   Exp. II. Carbon in POM 212 to 2000 mum and PMN were the more sensitive
   indicators of tillage effects, mainly in Exp. I.}},

Abstract = {{Land shortages are forcing smallholder farmers to cultivate steeplands.
   Resulting accelerated soil erosion is being addressed by the promotion
   of soil and water conservation (SWC) technologies, such as cross-slope
   barriers. These are designed to reduce soil and water loss and increase
   productivity. Farmer adoption rates, however, are low and many
   development organisations have reverted to using direct incentives, such
   as cash payments and food-for-work, to attract participating farmers.
   Research in Central America shows that whilst these incentives stimulate
   implementation of SWC technologies, many of the farmers abandon the
   technologies once the direct incentives are withdrawn.
   Field research from 1996 to 1998, involving farmed test plots on slopes
   greater than 33 sought to test a priori assumptions about the impact on
   soil loss and maize production following adoption of SWC technologies.
   Research demonstrates that at least one typical SWC technology-live
   barriers of Vetiveria zizanioides (vetiver grass)-has little or no
   impact on reducing soil loss or contributing to increased maize yields.
   This explains why, in the absence of direct incentives, few farmers
   adopt official recommendations: farmers see little benefit from their
   investment in the implementation and maintenance of SWC technologies.
   However, there are major off- and on-farm benefits to reduced soil loss
   and the research suggests that these benefits can be attained without
   the use of direct incentives, which are neither sustainable nor
   contribute to farmer empowerment. An alternative approach is to promote
   strategies that seek to combine farmers' concerns about productivity
   with conservationists' concerns about reducing soil erosion, often via
   soil cover management and an improvement in soil quality.
   The alternative approach poses a challenge to development practitioners,
   politicians, and society in general. Firstly, a new professionalism is
   needed in which the interests of farmers are put first and where
   farmers' active participation in decision-making is encouraged.
   Secondly, farmers are more likely to practice better land management if
   they have secure access to land and receive favourable prices for
   agricultural products. These so-called indirect incentives are only
   likely to come about in the context of an enabling policy environment,
   created, in turn, by pressure from public and private institutions. (C)

Abstract = {{Improvement of physical-chemical soil quality is a key step for carrying
   out revegetation programs of degraded lands in Mediterranean semiarid
   areas. Organic residue addition may restore the quality of these areas.
   A field experiment was conducted in a silt-loam soil (Typic Petrocalcid)
   from a degraded semiarid Mediterranean area to evaluate the effect of
   the addition of a composted urban residue on soil aggregate stability,
   bulk density and chemical properties and on the establishment of
   Pistacia lentiscus and Retama sphaerocarpa seedlings. The composted
   residue was applied at a rate of 6.7 kg m(-2) before planting. The
   nutrient content (NPK), total organic C and water soluble C were
   increased and bulk density was decreased, in the rhizosphere soil of
   both shrub species, by the composted residue. The addition of composted
   residue significantly increased the soil aggregate stability by about
   22\% for both shrub species. The beneficial effect of the composted
   residue on soil quality still persisted 18 months after addition.
   Eighteen months after planting, the addition of composted residue to
   soil had increased significantly the production of shoot biomass by P.
   lentiscus and R. sphaerocarpa, by about 160\% and 320\% respectively,
   compared to control values. Composted residue addition to soil can be
   considered an effective preparation method of a degraded area for
   carrying out successful revegetation programs with Mediterranean shrubs
   under semiarid conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   rotations: Effects on production, nitrogen economy, and water use in a
   Brown Chernozem. Can. J. Plant Sci. 83: 667-680. Producers in the
   semiarid Canadian prairies rely on frequent summerfallowing (F) to
   conserve water, control weed infestations, and maximize soil mineral N
   reserves, but this practice often results in soil degradation. A crop
   rotation experiment was initiated in 1987 on a medium-textured, Orthic
   Brown Chernozern at Swift Current, Saskatchewan, to determine the most
   ideal cropping frequency for wheat in this region and whether a fixed
   rotation such as fallow-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) - wheat (F-W-W) or
   F-W-W-W would be more effective than flexible rotations in which
   fallowing is decided each spring based on criteria such as available
   soil water (if water), or the need to control perennial weed
   infestations (if weeds). The study also compared the production of
   traditional Canada Western Red Spring (CWRS) wheat class with the newer
   higher-yielding (Hy), Canada Prairie Spring (CPS) wheat class. We
   analyzed results of six rotations over the first 12 yr of the study. The
   rotations included F-W-W, F-W-W-W, F-Hy-Hy, Continuous wheat (Cont W),
   Cont W (if weeds), and Cont W (if water). Reduced tillage management was
   used and stubble was cut tall to enhance snowtrap. Fertilizer N was
   applied based on soil tests and fertilizer P was applied based on the
   general recommendations for the region. Over the 1988-1999 period,
   weather conditions were generally favourable and yields were above
   average for this region. Canada Prairie Spring wheat outyielded CWRS by
   32\% when grown on fallow and by 17\% when grown on stubble; however,
   straw yields of the two wheat classes were similar on fallow and CPS was
   11\% less than CWRS on stubble. Harvest index (HI) averaged 44\% for CPS
   and 37\% for CWRS wheat. Water use efficiency for CWRS wheat grown on
   fallow averaged 7.2 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) and for CPS 9.4; when grown on
   stubble the respective values were 6.3 and 7.5 kg ha(-1) mm(-1). Grain N
   concentration for CWRS was slightly higher for wheat grown on fallow
   (25.7 g kg(-1)) than on stubble (24.5 g kg(-1)), but was similar for CPS
   wheat on grown on fallow and stubble (21.9 g kg(-1)). Straw N
   concentration averaged 3.8 g kg(-1) for CWRS and 4.4 g kg(-1) for CPS.
   Nitrogen yield for grain from CPS was 9\% greater than from CWRS when
   grown on fallow, but there was no effect of wheat class when grown on
   stubble. Nitrogen yield of CPS straw was 15\% greater than for CWRS when
   grown on fallow, but on stubble N yield was generally not affected by
   wheat class. Nitrogen harvest index (NHI) averaged about 80\% for both
   wheat classes, whether grown on fallow or stubble. On a rotation basis,
   grain produced with F-W-W was 1502 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). The F-W-W-W and
   Cont W (if weeds) rotations produced 9\% more grain than F-W-W, while
   Cont W (if water) produced 24\% more, F-Hy-Hy produced 26\% more, and
   Cont W produced 30\% more than F-W-W. Nitrogen production in the grain,
   straw and aboveground plant material was lowest in F-W-W, highest in
   Cont W, and intermediate for other rotations. Although the economic and
   soil quality assessments have yet to be completed, a preliminary
   conclusion based on crop production characteristics alone suggests that
   a flexible cropping system in which available soil water in spring is
   used as the determining criterion is superior to a fixed F-W-W or F-W-}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic-N dynamics, its controlling factors and its relationships
   with stand quality were studied in the 0-15 cm soil layer of 24
   pinewoods with contrasting age, productivity and parent material
   (granite; acid schists), searching for N variables useful to predict
   stand growth and site quality. No significant differences were found
   between young and old stands for any of the N variables considered, nor
   two-or three-order interactions among stand age, site quality and parent
   material. The soil total-N content, which was correlated positively with
   the Al oxides content (a soil organic matter (SOM) stabilizing agent),
   did not vary significantly according to parent material, but it was
   lower (P less than or equal to 0.02) in stands with high than with low
   site index (2.68 +/- 1.11 and 3.97 +/- 1.13 g N kg(-1) soil,
   respectively). The soil delta(15)N ranged from +3.5 to +6.5 delta,
   without significant differences among stand groups, and it was
   negatively correlated with water holding capacity, exchangeable bases,
   Al oxides and N content, suggesting that: (i) N losses by NO3 leaching
   are the most important controlling factor of delta(15)N in these
   temperate humid region soils; and (ii) soil N richness is related with
   limited N losses, which discriminate against 15 N. At any incubation
   time, no significant differences were found in soil inorganic-N content
   among stand groups (7.78 +/- 4.57, 39.33 +/- 16.20 and 67.80 +/- 26.50
   mg N kg(-1) soil at 0, 42 and 84 d, respectively). During the
   incubation, the relative importance of ammonification decreased and that
   of the nitrification increased. The net N mineralization rate (NNMR, in
   percentage of organic N) was significantly higher in granite than in
   schists soils at both 42 d (1.24 +/- 0.34 and 0.75 +/- 0.37\%,
   respectively) and 84 d (2.18 +/- 0.56 and 1.53 +/- 0.66\%,
   respectively). In high quality pinewoods, the NNMR at 42 and 84 d (1.16
   +/- 0.45 and 2.12 +/- 0.79\%, respectively) were significantly higher
   than in low quality stands (0.83 +/- 0.35 and 1.59 +/- 0.45\%,
   respectively). This result, together with those on soil total-N and
   inorganic-N supply, suggests that soil N dynamics in low and high
   quality stands are different: in the former there is a bigger N pool
   with a slower turnover, whereas in the latter there is a smaller N pool
   with a faster turnover, both factors being nearly compensated, making
   the soil available N supply in both types of stand similar. After 42 and
   84 d of incubation, the NNMR and the nitrification rates were higher in
   the coarse textured soils, likely due to the low physical and chemical
   protection of their SOM; both rates were positively correlated with
   available P, exchangeable K+ and CEC base saturation, suggesting strong
   relationships among the availabilities of the main plant nutrients, and
   they increased with SOM quality (low C-to-N ratio). The strong negative
   correlation of site index with soil total-N (r = -0.707; P less than or
   equal to 0.005), and its positive correlations with NNMR after 42 and 84
   d of incubation, suggested that site quality and potential productivity
   are closely related to soil organic-N dynamics. Half of the site index
   variation in the stands studied could be predicted with a cheap and easy
   analysis of soil N content, the prediction being slightly improved if
   soil 815 N is included and, more significantly, by including N
   mineralization measurements. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil respiration (CO2 evolution and O-2 uptake), alkaline phosphatase
   activity, resin-extractable phosphate, and dissolved organic C dynamics
   were compared during a 36-day incubation of soil collected from within
   crop rows of conservation tillage (CT) (CT = no-till and ridge-till) and
   moldboard plow/disc tillage (PT) plots in a high-temperature, semiarid
   climate after 9 years.
   Significantly (P <0.05) greater total soil organic C, N, and extractable
   P were found in CT soils. Organic C was 14.2,13.4, and 10.3 g kg(-1) in
   the no-till, ridge-till, and PT treatments, respectively. Organic N was
   1.41 1.26, and 0.95 g kg(-1), whereas resin-extractable P was 11.4, 9.3,
   and 6.4 mg kg(-1) for the same treatments.
   CO2 production in CT treatments was 916\% and 758\% greater,
   respectively, for the no-till and ridge-till treatments than for the PT
   treatment. Highest O-2 uptake occurred in the CT (NT and RT) treatments,
   which were 435\% and 359\% higher, respectively, than uptake in PT.
   Respiratory quotients (RQs) were similar among the CT treatments, but
   they were significantly (P <0.05) higher than those in PT. This suggests
   that there may be a difference in substrate composition caused by
   tillage, and consequent differences in microbial respiratory activity
   indicate that biological controls of phosphorus mineralization are
   becoming better established, although absolute changes in soil organic C
   and N concentrations were modest. Dissolved organic C ranged from a high
   of \&GT;50 \&mu;g C g(-1) soil in CT to \&LT;20 \&mu;g C g(-1) soil in
   PT.
   Significant correlations between soluble P and biological activity
   indices (respiration, RQ, and phosphatase activity) indicate that even
   modest improvements in soil organic matter can have measurable impacts
   on P mineralization.
   These results suggest there may be differences in soil substrate quality
   that result from conservation tillage and which lead to differences in
   microbial activities, as well as to improvements in P cycling and soil
   quality, from even modest gains in soil C in high-temperature
   subtropical soils.}},

Abstract = {{The papers in this special issue present results of the European Union
   (EU) concerted action ``Experiences with the impact of subsoil
   compaction on soil crop growth and environment and ways to prevent
   subsoil compaction{''}. The results and conclusions of earlier research
   on subsoil compaction are memorized and it is emphasized that the
   conclusions are still sound: high axle load traffic on soils of high
   moisture content causes deep and persistent subsoil compaction. The
   concerted action on subsoil compaction in the EU and an almost identical
   concerted action on subsoil compaction in central and eastern Europe are
   briefly introduced. This special issue presents a selection of papers of
   the concluding workshop of the concerted action on subsoil compaction in
   the EU. It includes three papers on modeling the impact of subsoil
   compaction on crop growth, water availability to plants and
   environmental aspects; three papers on modeling of subsoil compaction by
   heavy machinery; four papers on measurement of soil mechanical and
   physical proper-ties in relation to subsoil compaction and four papers
   on methods to determine the risk of subsoil compaction and to identify
   prevention strategies. The trends in agriculture in relation to subsoil
   compaction are discussed. A positive trend is that policy makers in the
   EU and worldwide recognize soil as a vital and largely non-renewable
   resource increasingly under pressure. A negative trend is that wheel
   loads in agriculture are still increasing causing severe damage to
   subsoils. The conclusion is that European subsoils are more threatened
   than ever in history. Manufactures, agricultural engineers and soil
   scientists should collaborate and research should be initiated to solve
   this problem and find solutions. Subsoil compaction should be made
   recognized by all people involved from farmer to policy maker. Therefore
   an assessment of the existence and seriousness of subsoil compaction
   throughout Europe should be initiated. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To develop a solid scientific basis for maintaining soil quality and
   formulating effective remediation strategies, it is critical to
   determine bow environmentally-important trace metals are sequestered in
   soils at the molecular scale. The speciation of Mn, Fe and Cu in soil
   organic matter has been determined by synchrotron-based techniques:
   extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption
   near edge structure (XANES). We show the structural similarity between
   the surface complexes of Mn-II, Fe-III and Cu-II. These cations are
   bound to the surface through oxygen atoms. Each one presents a more or
   less tetragonal-distorted octahedral geometry. The use of X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy provides a relevant method for determining
   trace-metal speciation in both natural and contaminated environmental
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to make a comprehensive comparative study of
   plant species behaviour in the Vosges Mountains of Western Europe and
   the Western Carpathians of Central Europe. We will then look at the
   consequences-of the differences observed on the calibration of
   environmental variables using the bioindicator values of the plant
   species.
   The variables altitude correlated to rainfall and temperature and pH of
   the A horizon of the soil are used to compare species behaviour. A
   response curve was established using a logistic model for each species
   according to these two variables. The response curve is used to
   determine the indicator values.
   Most of the species in the two regions react in a significant fashion to
   one or both of the variables. pH has a more marked effect than altitude
   in the Vosges Mountains (it affects 69\% of species). The reverse is
   true in the Western Carpathians (pH affects only 28\% of the species in
   this area).
   Species behaviour varies widely from one region to the other, both for
   pH and for altitude. The proportion of neutrophilous or subalpine
   species common to both areas is roughly twice as large in the Vosges
   Mountains as in the Western Carpathians. These differences in behaviour
   can be explained by the ecological contexts of each region.
   The high proportion of neutrophilous and subalpine species in Vosges
   Mountains is responsible for a shift of predictions of variables with
   vegetation towards large values of pH and altitude in this land. pH
   values are better predicted in the Vosges Mountains than in the Western
   Carpathians. Despite a smaller number of species sensitive to altitude
   in the Western Carpathians, this variable is better predicted in this
   land than in the Vosges Mountains. These results show that importance of
   a variable for vegetation has an influence on the quality of
   predictions.
   The wide difference in ecological behaviour of species from one region
   to the other and the very variable quality of predictions would suggest
   caution in the use of indicator values and their extrapolation to other
   regions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understory vegetation in aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands
   produces up to 50\% of all forage on Crown land for domestic livestock
   grazing in the Peace River area of British Columbia (BC), Canada. The
   objective of this study was to determine the effects of clearcut
   harvesting and long-term cattle grazing on plant species diversity and
   soil quality in aspen cutblocks located about 5 km south of Dawson Creek
   in the Peace River region of BC. The site was winter harvested from
   November 1988 to March 1989. Cattle grazing was done for one month per
   year (early June to early July) to achieve 75\% utilization of forage
   vegetation. The experiment was laid out as a split-plot randomized
   complete block design with three replications and four transects per
   plot. Sample collection and vegetation assessments were completed during
   the summer 2001. Timber harvesting of these aspen stands increased the
   cover of plant species such as bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis
   canadensis), northern bedstraw (Galium boreale), tall bluebells
   (Mertensia paniculata), and sweet coltsfoot (Petasites frigidus)
   probably as a result of greater light transmission. The cover of young
   aspen was increased by timber harvesting by over 15 times, while the
   cover of young balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) increased by over 200
   times. Ten years of cattle grazing did not significantly affect the
   canopy cover of aspen, but increased the total number of plant species
   relative to the ungrazed treatments because of enhanced colonization of
   endemic species. The measured soil properties were not significantly
   affected by either the timber harvest or the long-term cattle grazing.
   Soil penetration resistance showed that harvesting and cattle grazing
   did not result in soil compaction. Results showed that with appropriate
   management the timber and ranching industries are compatible on
   regenerating aspen stands in the Peace River region. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Interactions between the diversity of primary producers (plants) and of
   decomposers (microbes and mesofaunal communities), the two key
   functional groups that form the basis of all ecosystems have major
   consequences on the functioning of agricultural ecosystems. Soil
   microorganisms control the transformation and mineralization of natural
   compounds and xenobiotics. The soil microbiota, existing in extremely
   high density and diversity, rapidly modify the energetic performance and
   activity rates to changing environmental conditions. Thus, the microbial
   consortium possesses the ability to accommodate environmental
   constraints by adjusting (i) activity rates, (ii) biomass, and (iii)
   community structure. These parameters are particularly important to take
   into consideration when evaluating soil quality. The present paper gives
   an overview about the possibilities to use bacterial and fungal
   populations as an indicator for soil quality. Furthermore also the
   applicability of nematodes for the determination of soil health will be
   discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The protection of soils as habitat for soil organisms which is
   ascertained in the German soil protection act calls for the development
   of a broad, holistic approach with biological objectives. As a first
   step towards establishing a system that meets these criteria, two pilot
   studies have been conducted. The scope of these studies was to
   investigate whether there were characteristic soil fauna communities for
   specific sites or for pedologically defined groups of sites. We sampled
   the macrofauna groups earthworms, chilopods, diplopods, and isopods and
   the mesofauna groups enchytraeids, predatory mites (Gamasina), and moss
   mites (Oribatida). We could show that there were typical soil fauna
   communities that belong to specific site groups, e.g. acid forests or
   agricultural sites. The recorded patterns were more distinct the more
   taxa were incorporated in the analyses. The macrofauna alone gave good
   results but did not differentiate within the main site groups.
   Earthworms separated the open sites from the forests, whereas the
   arthropods differentiated within the forest sites. Mesofauna taxa added
   valuable information to the macrofauna results. We concluded that macro-
   and mesofauna together form site specific species assemblages that may
   be used for defining typical soil fauna communities for specific soils.
   This site specific soil fauna community can be used as a reference for
   assessing biological soil quality. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The demand for quick and reproducible soil quality indicators in order
   to detect soil quality changes have increased over the last decade.
   Since soil functioning and sustaining soil fertility is governed largely
   by the decomposition activity of the microflora, there is particularly a
   need for microbial-based indicators. This short overview presents
   concepts and recent discussions found in the pertaining literature about
   the ``microbial biodiversity{''} aspect of taxonomic species diversity
   in relation to environmental impact and taxonomic species diversity in
   relation to soil functioning, both of which seem at present inadequate
   for use as indicators. It also introduces the potential of ecological
   theory at the microbial community level and its use for indicator
   development. Here, own experiences on eco-physiological indicators are
   presented and their possible use for establishing eco-physiological
   profiles of soil sites are proposed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper the effects of precision farming were compared to
   conventional agricultural management estimating bacterial and fungal
   diversity and also microbial processes in the nitrogen cycle during the
   vegetation period of maize. The aim was to find parameters which can be
   used as indicators for sustainable soil quality. Two plots, a high yield
   and a low yield site, were selected in the two systems. It could be
   demonstrated that the microbial biomass and community structure of
   bacteria and fungi in the top soils were not influenced by precision
   farming. Microbial biomass was reduced during the summer month, due to
   the dryness and hot temperatures. The microbial community structure
   changed in late spring time probably due to the application of
   fertilizers and high amounts of root exudates in the rhizosphere.
   The measured enzymatic activities however did not show only a seasonal
   variation with the highest measured values in spring and early summer,
   but also clear effects based on the investigated plot (high yield or low
   yield) and the used farming management system (conventional or
   precision). Proteolytic activity was significantly higher on the high
   yield plots at all measured times. Mainly on the low yield sites
   precision farming caused a higher proteolytic activity compared to the
   conventional management. Nitrification and denitrification activities
   were mainly effected after the application of N-fertilizer. Significant
   higher values were found on the low yield plots, where conventional
   farming was applied. The results indicate that the effectiveness of
   nitrogen turnover might be a good indicator for sustainable agriculture
   and soil quality. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Existing strategies for pesticide use reduction in the northern Great
   Plains have suffered from limited adoption. A novel approach, Pesticide
   Free Production (PFP), was recently developed in Manitoba, Canada. A
   participatory, on-farm study was conducted to assess the potential of
   PFP to be implemented on typical farms and the level of success farmers
   experienced with PFP. Pesticide Free Production prohibits the use of
   in-crop pesticide and seed treatments during one crop year as well as
   prior use of residual pesticides. Synthetic fertilizer use is permitted,
   as are pre-emergent applications of nonresidual pesticides. A total of
   71 farmers, representing 120 fields and 11 crops, participated in the
   study. Fields and farmers were grouped based on whether or not fields
   (i) achieved PFP certification and (ii) were in transition to organic
   production. Certification was achieved for 83\% of the participating
   area. Spring cereals were the most likely crops to achieve PFP
   certification. Yields in all groups were slightly lower than
   conventional averages in Manitoba but were not significantly different
   among groups. Weed densities were higher (P = 0.065) in noncertifiable
   fields than in certifiable fields. Most farmers reported manageable weed
   densities in the year following PFP. Soil conservation practices were
   used on a high proportion of PFP fields. Management practices associated
   with PFP included the use of delayed seeding, forages in rotation, and
   increased seeding rates. Agronomic and demographic characteristics of
   participating fields and farmers were typical for Manitoba. Pesticide
   Free Production demonstrates considerable potential to be successfully
   adopted by mainstream farmers.}},

Abstract = {{Transformation in Polish agriculture initiated by political changes in
   the 1990s brought about essential variations in the structure of
   agricultural land use. The share of cereals in cropping patterns
   increased, while fodder plants decreased. In addition, the level of
   mineral fertilization was reduced. In livestock production animal stock
   showed a sharp fall, which led to a decreased load of organic
   fertilization. The changes in cropping pattern and lower fertilization
   rates resulted in a decrease in the organic matter level in soils, which
   may impair soil quality status. These phenomena were strongly manifested
   in the Wielkopolska Region mainly because of the prevalence of light
   soils in this area, from which nutrients are readily washed out to
   groundwaters. It was found that many of the negative aspects of these
   changes in the agricultural landscape can be mitigated by establishing
   shelterbelts. We conclude that shelterbeds are especially effective in
   the control of nutrient output from a watershed.}},

Abstract = {{The 1999 severe crop season drought in the northeastern US was followed
   by hurricane-driven torrential rains in September, offering a unique
   opportunity to observe how managed and natural systems respond to
   climate-related stress. The Rodale Institute Farming Systems Trial has
   been operating since 1981 and consists of three replicated cropping
   systems, one organic manure based (MNR), one organic legume based (LEG)
   and a conventional system (CNV). The MNR system consists of a 5-year
   maize-soybean-wheat-clover/hay rotation, the LEG of a 3-year
   maize-soybean-wheat-green manure, and the CNV of a 5-year maize-soybean
   rotation. Subsoil lysimeters allowed quantification of percolated water
   in each system. Average maize and soybean yields were similar in all
   three systems over the post-transition years (1985-1998). Five drought
   years occurred between 1984 and 1998 and in four of them the organic
   maize outyielded the CNV by significant margins. In 1999 all crop
   systems suffered severe yield depressions; however, there were
   substantial yield differences between systems. Organic maize yielded
   38\% and 137\% relative to CNV in the LEG and MNR treatments,
   respectively, and 196\% and 152\% relative to CNV in the soybean plots.
   The primary mechanism of the higher yield of the MNR and LEG is proposed
   to be the higher water-holding capacity of the soils in those
   treatments, while the lower yield of the LEG maize was due to weed
   competition in that particular year and treatment. Soils in the organic
   plots captured more water and retained more of it in the crop root zone
   than in the CNV treatment. Water capture in the organic plots was
   approximately 100\% higher than in CNV plots during September's
   torrential rains.}},

Abstract = {{Cropping systems influence the ecology of agricultural soils. The
   effects of crop rotation and N fertilization on the activities of four
   amidohydrolases (amidase, L-asparaginase, L-aspartase, and
   L-glutaminase) were studied in soils of two long-term cropping systems
   in Iowa: the Northeast Research Center (NERC) and the Clarion-Webster
   Research Center (CWRC) that were initiated in 1979 and 1954,
   respectively, and sampled in 1996 and 1997. Multicropping systems,
   especially meadow-oat-based systems, enhanced the activities of the
   amidohydrolases; monocropping systems, involving corn or soybean,
   reduced the activities of the four enzymes. Analysis of variance
   indicated that activities of the amidohydrolases were significantly
   affected by cropping systems at the NERC site in both years; but only
   amidase activity was significantly affected by N fertilization. With the
   exception of amidase, the activities of the other three enzymes were not
   affected by cropping systems and N fertilization in the soils at the
   CWRC site. The activities of the four amidohydrolases were significantly
   correlated with soil microbial carbon (C(mic)) (r > 0.447 and r > 0.398,
   P < 0.01), soil microbial nitrogen (N(mic)) (r > 0.445, P < 0.01 and r >
   0.596, P < 0.001), and the amount of N mineralized in 24 weeks of
   incubation at 30degreesC (r > 0.427 and r > 0.467, P < 0.05) in soils of
   the CWRC and NERC sites, respectively. The specific activities of the
   four enzymes in soils under multicropping systems were greater than
   those under monocropping systems. The results suggest that the
   mineralization of organic N in the soil is mediated by microbial biomass
   through the action of these enzymes, and that the activities of the
   amidohydrolases can be used to predict N mineralization and monitor soil
   health and quality. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of air-drying on dehydrogenase, invertase, P-glucosidase,
   urease, phosphatase, arylsulphatase and phenoloxidase activities was
   measured in three soils affected by anthropogenic activities and in
   control soils sampled from neighbouring areas. The air-drying changed
   enzyme activity, but the behaviour was neither site-specific nor
   enzyme-sensitive. Canonical discriminant analysis of enzymatic
   activities of both moist fresh and air-dried samples was able to
   discriminate between altered and unaltered soils irrespective of the
   site. Numerical alteration indices were developed as a linear function
   of the seven enzyme activities and the one obtained from fresh sample
   data was more successful. Air-drying, apparently alters in unpredictable
   ways enzyme activities of soils, which could lead to misinterpretation
   of results.}},

Abstract = {{Reports about the relationship between soil water retention and organic
   carbon content are contradictory. We hypothesized that this relationship
   is affected by both proportions of textural components and amount of
   organic carbon. To test the hypothesis, we used the U.S. National Soil
   Characterization database and the database from pilot studies on soil
   quality as affected by long-term management. Regression trees and group
   method of data handling (GMDH) revealed a complex joint effect of
   texture and taxonomic order on water retention at -33 kPa. Adding
   information on taxonomic order and on taxonomic order and organic carbon
   content to the textural class brought 10\% and 20\% improvement in water
   retention estimation, respectively, as compared with estimation from the
   textural class alone. Using total clay, sand and silt along with organic
   carbon content and taxonomic order resulted in 25\% improvement in
   accuracy over using textural classes. Similar but lower trends in
   accuracy were found for water retention at -1500 kPa and the slope of
   the water retention curve. At low organic carbon contents, the
   sensitivity of the water retention to changes in organic matter content
   was highest in sandy soils. Increase in organic matter content led to
   increase of water retention in sandy soils, and to a decrease in
   fine-textured soils. At high organic carbon values, all soils showed an
   increase in water retention. The largest increase was in sandy and silty
   soils. Results are expressed as equations that can be used to evaluate
   effect of the carbon sequestration and management practices on soil
   hydraulic properties. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Non-selective grazing (NSG) is a relatively novel way of farming
   livestock in the Nama Karoo of South Africa. Our key question was how
   heavy grazing under this high-intensity, low-frequency grazing system
   would impact on certain soil properties. The study was designed to
   compare the impacts of NSG (treatment) with no grazing (control) in
   terms of: (1) amount of soil organic carbon (OC); (2) soil microbial
   respiration rates; (3) soil stability and infiltration properties. The
   treatment significantly lowered the amount of OC in the topsoil.
   Microbial respiration rates corresponded with the fertile patch matrix
   in both treatment and control with significantly higher respiration
   rates measured under plants compared to open, unvegetated areas.
   Respiration rates in treatment open areas were significantly higher than
   in control open areas. There was a trend (P < 0.1) for higher aggregate
   stability, final infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration for
   treatment open soils compared to controls during an initial rain event
   of 44 mm hour(-1) in a rainfall simulator. During a second rain event on
   sealed soils only aggregate stability was significantly higher for
   treatment compared to control soils. We conclude that the
   short-duration, low-frequency, intensive herbivory by livestock under
   the non-selective grazing system resulted in a more active microbial
   community, which turned over organic matter more rapidly and led to
   higher soil stability and infiltration capacity of open, unvegetated
   soils. We present this as an example of conditions where herding by high
   densities of large herbivores can have positive impacts on soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of dairy cattle slurry management on soil biota, soil
   respiration and nitrogen (N) mineralization were evaluated in a farm
   trial across 12 farms and a field experiment on 2 farms located in a
   dairy farming area in the north of the Netherlands. The slurry
   management consisted of slit injection or surface application of slurry;
   the use or no use of additives {[}Euromestmix((R)) (MX) and Effective
   Microbe((R)) (EM)] and the type and level of inorganic N fertilization.
   Slit injection negatively affected epigeic earthworms whereas its effect
   on anecic and endogeic earthworms was absent or even positive.
   Enchytraeids were not affected in a consistent way, whereas numbers of
   nematodes indicative of nutrient-enriched conditions increased.
   Inorganic N fertilizer had similar effects. Bacterial diversity was not
   different among the treatments. Nitrifier diversity, however, was high
   at one of the farms in the field experiment, and was negatively affected
   by inorganic N fertilizer. The use of MX was usually associated with
   higher numbers of earthworms. EM affected numbers of earthworms and
   numbers of bacterial and plant-feeding nematodes, but only in specific
   combinations of field history, slurry type and slurry application
   method. We found no effects of EM on the composition of the microbial
   community. Soil respiration was increased when slurry was
   surface-applied. The calculated N mineralization by earthworms was in
   the order of 70-20 kg N ha(-1)year(-1). It was highest under
   farm-characteristic surface application of slurry with MX and lowest
   under farm-characteristic slit injection of slurry without additives.
   Compared with the N mineralization by earthworms, that by enchytraeids
   and nematodes was quantitatively insignificant. Negative treatment
   effects on earthworms led to corresponding reductions in calculated N
   mineralization.}},

   compounds, tannins were believed to function primarily as herbivore
   deterrents. However, recent evidence casts doubts on their universal
   effectiveness against herbivory. Alternatively, tannins may play an
   important role in plant - plant and plant - litter - soil interactions.
   The convergent evolution of tannin-rich plant communities on highly
   acidic and infertile soils throughout the world, and the intraspecific
   variation in tannin concentrations along edaphic gradients suggests that
   tannins can affect nutrient cycles. This paper reviews nutrient dynamics
   in forest ecosystems in relation to tannins. Tannins comprise a complex
   class of organic compounds whose concentration and chemistry differ
   greatly both among and within plant species. Because the function and
   reactivity of tannins are strongly controlled by their chemical
   structure, the effects of tannins on forest ecosystem processes are
   expected to vary widely. Tannins can affect nutrient cycling by
   hindering decomposition rates, complexing proteins, inducing toxicity to
   microbial populations and inhibiting enzyme activities. As a result,
   tannins may reduce nutrient losses in infertile ecosystems and may alter
   N cycling to enhance the level of organic versus mineral N forms. The
   ecological consequences of elevated tannin levels may include
   allelopathic responses, changes in soil quality and reduced ecosystem
   productivity. These effects may alter or control successional pathways.
   While a great deal of research has addressed tannins and their role in
   nutrient dynamics, there are many facets of tannin biogeochemistry that
   are not known. This lack of information hinders a complete synthesis of
   tannin effects on forest ecosystem processes and nutrient cycling. Areas
   of study that would help clarify the role of tannins in forest
   ecosystems include improved characterization and quantification
   techniques, enhanced understanding of structure-activity relationships,
   investigation of the fate of tannins in soil, further determination of
   the influence of environmental factors on plant tannin production and
   decomposition, and additional information on the effects of tannins on
   soil organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter and its different pools have key importance in
   nutrient availability, soil aggregation, and in the greenhouse gas
   fluxes between the earth surface and the atmosphere. The objectives of
   this study were: a) to evaluate the effect of maize production systems
   under organic and mineral fertilization on total organic carbon (TOC)
   and total nitrogen (TN) stocks and on organic carbon pools (C) in an
   Acrisol; and b) to estimate the contribution of these systems in the
   atmospheric CO2 sequestration or emission. The production systems
   included two levels of organic compost: level 0 (control) and level 1
   (40 m(3) ha(-1)); and three levels of mineral fertilizer (0, 1 and 2),
   which correspond to 0,250 (AM1), and 500 kg ha(-1) (AM2) of the 4-14-8
   formula. Organic and mineral fertilizer were combined and applied during
   16 years. As a reference of the steady state, soil samples were
   collected from an adjacent area of the same soil type, under secondary
   Atlantic Forest (AF). Where organic compost was added, the production
   systems presented higher organic C and N soil storage, light fraction
   carbon (C-LF) and labile carbon (C-L) than production systems without
   fertilization or with mineral fertilizer only. This confirms the
   importance of organic fertilizer utilization as a management strategy to
   improve soil quality. However, the soil under AF showed higher values of
   organic C and N storage and carbon pools,than soils under production
   systems. Due to their higher sensitivity, the stocks of the C-LF and C-L
   were more severely decreased than the TOC stocks and thus, may be used
   as indicators of-the anthropogenic impact or the influence of management
   alterations on the soil organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrates have long been known to promote seed germination in many
   species, and various proposals have been made regarding the role of
   nitrates in this process. One hypothesis suggests a possible ecological
   role for nitrate, providing the seeds with a report of soil nitrogen
   status and the proximity of already established plants. However,
   nitrogen oxides (NO, NO2), which are present in the soil, also may be
   information carriers that indicate not only soil nitrate content, but
   also microbial activity and, therefore, soil quality. Because of annual
   variation of soil trace gas fluxes, seeds could be provided with
   information on seasonal and climate changes in their surroundings. Thus,
   nitrogen oxides would be the outer information carriers providing the

Abstract = {{Using pre-established trial sites on allophanic soils, we investigated
   the impacts of long to medium-term pastoral management practices, such
   as fertilisation and grazing intensity, on a range of soil biological
   and biochemical properties; hot water-extractable C (HWC), water-soluble
   C (WSC), hot-water extractable total carbohydrates, microbial biomass-C
   and N and mineralisable N. These properties were examined for their
   usefulness as soil quality indicators responding to changes in the
   rhizosphere caused by management practices. Adjacent cropping, market
   garden and native bush sites located on similar soil types were included
   to determine the changes in soil biological and biochemical properties
   resulting from changes in land use. The seasonal variability of HWC and
   its relationship with other labile fractions of soil organic matter was
   also examined.
   Microbial biomass-C, mineralisable N and extractable total carbohydrates
   showed promise in differentiating treatment and land use effects.
   However, HWC was one of the most sensitive and consistent indicators
   examined at 52 different sites. The impact of different land uses on the
   amounts of HWC in the same soil type was far greater than that was
   observed for the soil organic carbon. The average values of HWC for soil
   under different land use were: native (4000 mug C g(-1) soil),
   sheep/beef pastures (3400), dairy pastures (3000), cropping (1000) and
   market gardening soils (850). HWC was also sensitive to differences
   within an ecosystem, e.g. effects of grazing intensities and effects of
   N or P fertilisers on pastures. The sheep and beef/cattle grazed
   pastures always had higher amounts of HWC than the intensively grazed
   dairy pastures. Nitrogen fertiliser application (200 and 400 kg N ha(-1)
   yr(-1)) over the previous 5 yr had significant (P < 0.001) negative
   impacts on HWC and other soil microbial properties. In contrast,
   long-term application of P fertilisers had a significant (P < 0.001)
   positive effect on the HWC levels in pastoral soils. In the case of
   long-term P trials, HWC increased even though no increase in the total
   soil carbon pool was detected.
   HWC was positively correlated with soil microbial biomass-C (R(2) =
   0.84), microbial nitrogen (R(2) = 0.72), mineralisable N (R(2) = 0.86),
   and total carbohydrates (R(2) = 0.88). All these correlations were
   significant at P < 0.001 level of significance. The HWC was also
   positively correlated with WSC and total organic C. However, these
   correlations were poorer than those found for other soil parameters.
   Most of these measurements have been actively promoted as key indicators
   of soil quality. Given the strong correlations between HWC and other
   biochemical measurements, HWC could be used as an integrated measure of
   soil quality. When HWC is extracted, other pools of labile nutrients are
   also extracted along with C. Therefore it is suggested that decline in
   HWC would also indicate a decline in other labile organic pools of
   nutrients such as nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus. About 40-50\% of the
   C in the HWC extract was present as carbohydrates. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that particulate organic matter (POM) and
   aggregate dry mean weight diameter (DMWD) are related to fertilizer-use
   efficiency (FUE) and leaching susceptibility. Soil cores (15 cm diam. by
   50 cm depth) were collected from 12 farm fields representing three
   cropping systems: conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) management of
   corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotations, and CT
   applied to more diversified corn-soybean-based rotations (R-CT). Three
   of the four R-CT farms were organically managed. In a 95-d greenhouse
   trial, cores were seeded with corn, amended with N-15-labeled urea
   applied at four rates (0, 75, 150, 225 kg N ha(-1)), and subjected to a
   stressful moisture regime. Aggregate DMWD, which serves as a rough index
   of pore-size distribution, was greater in NT cores. Although total
   leached N was similar in all cropping systems, increased macropore flow
   in NT cores led to greater leaching of fertilizer N and less leaching of
   soil-derived N, as well as greater moisture stress and decreased plant N
   uptake. The R-CT cores had more POM and organic C in the top 30 cm of
   soil and higher crop biomass and biomass-N content. However, FUE in R-CT
   cores was relatively low since FUE does not account for contributions of
   indigenous N. For the same reason, FUE remained relatively high in CT
   systems despite less labile organic matter. Both FUE and SOM
   conservation declined with increasing N application rates. Increasing
   labile sources of N, reflected in POM pools, through crop
   diversification can substitute for incremental increases in fertilizer N
   and improve long-term productivity on Illinois Mollisols.}},

Abstract = {{This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that an improved system
   of catchment management in combination with appropriate cropping
   practices can sustain increased crop production and improve soil quality
   of Vertisols, compared with prevailing traditional farming practices.
   Initiated in 1976, the improved system consisted of integrated land
   management to conserve soil and water, with excess rainwater being
   removed in a controlled manner. This was combined with improved crop
   rotation (legume based) and integrated nutrient management. In the
   traditional system, sorghum or chickpea was grown in the postrainy
   season with organic fertilizers, and in the rainy season the field was
   maintained as a cultivated fallow. The average grain yield of the
   improved system over 24 years was 4.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1), nearly a
   five-fold increase over the traditional system (about 1 t ha(-1)
   yr(-1)). There was also evidence of increased organic C, total N and P,
   available N, P and K, microbial biomass C and N in the soil of the
   improved system. A positive relationship between soil available P and
   soil organic C suggested that application of P to Vertisols increased
   carbon sequestration by 7.4 t C ha(-1) and, in turn, the productivity of
   the legume-based system, thus ultimately enhancing soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Soil conservation in South Africa has historically focused on preventing
   soil erosion. Effective maintenance of the soil requires, in addition to
   erosion control, an understanding of how land-use practices affect more
   subtle indicators of soil quality. This review outlines how land use in
   South Africa can rapidly result in a marked reduction in soil organic
   matter (SOM) content and increased tendency of soils to crust. Removal
   of a cover of vegetation, whether by ploughing, grazing or burning,
   tends to reduce SOM due to reduced inputs of organic matter and enhanced
   activity of soil microbes. Loss of SOM, particularly from the top few
   centimetres of soil (named here the pedoderm), has a disproportionately
   large effect on soil infiltrability and nutrient supply. The mineralogy
   of the clay fraction also has great bearing on the response of soil to
   land-use effects. The unexpected role of quartz in soil dispersion and
   crusting in South Africa has only recently been revealed. Apart from SOM
   effects, land use can lead to subtle changes in soil chemistry.
   Plantation forestry has resulted in an increase in soil nitrate in many
   areas, possibly due to greater mineralization under forests than
   grasslands. Annual burning in the Kruger National Park bushveld has been
   shown to increase clay dispersibility and crusting of the pedoderm,
   which was ascribed to a reduction in electrical conductivity and SOM as
   well as to an increase in the exchangeable sodium percentage. Soil
   quality is a multifaceted concept. One aspect stands out, however, as
   critical and that is the conservation and replenishment of nitrogen,
   which is all-important for retaining humus and maintaining soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury (Hg) is a persistent soil pollutant that affects soil microbial
   activity. We monitored the changes in soil microbial biomass and
   activity of enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase, arylsulfatase,
   fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolytic activity, and o-diphenol oxidase
   (o-DPO) in three soils contaminated with different concentrations of Hg.
   Increasing levels of Hg, from 0.5 to 10 mumol/g of dried soil, generally
   depressed microbial activity; however, the effects of Hg on soil
   microbial activity depended on soil type and composition, particularly
   organic matter content. o-DPO was less affected by Hg than the other
   three enzymes tested. Our results indicate that the analysis of
   microbial biomass content and soil-enzyme activities may be used to
   predict the soil quality contaminated with Hg.}},

Abstract = {{The reclamation success of abandoned wellsites in agricultural areas
   depends on their capacity to sustain levels of biomass production
   similar to those which existed prior to soil disturbance. We examined
   the effect of four (0, 50, 100 and 150\%) topsoil replacement depths
   (TRD) and five amendment treatments {[}compost, manure, alfalfa
   (Medicago sativa L.) hay, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw, check] in
   the reclamation of three wellsites in south-central Alberta. The largest
   incremental effect of TRD on spring wheat response in the 4 yr
   (1997-2000) study occurred between the 0 and 50\% treatments. Increasing
   TRD from 100 to 150\% had little impact on crop response. Of the 20
   treatments (four TRD x five amendments), the reclamation capacity of the
   100\% TRD-compost treatment ranked highest, being 19\% higher than the
   baseline treatment (100\% TRD-check). The lowest-ranking treatment
   overall, was the 0\% TRD-straw treatment, which yielded 64\% of the
   baseline treatment. Crop yield responses to organic amendments were
   larger when the recipient soil was lower in organic matter. Positive
   responses to one-time applications of organic amendments in the
   short-term (4 yr), advocate their use in soil reclamation of abandoned
   wellsites, despite a lingering question about the longevity of their
   beneficial effects.}},

Abstract = {{The equilibrium partitioning method (EqP-method) can be used to
   calculate soil quality standards (expressed in mg/kg) from aquatic
   quality standards (expressed in mug/l) using a partitioning coefficient.
   The validity of this application of the EqP-method was studied comparing
   aquatic with terrestrial toxicity data. The data set collected for
   deriving environmental quality standards in the Netherlands, was used
   for this study. For 10 organic substances (chlorpyrifos, atrazine,
   carbofuran, pentachlorophenol, chlordane, aldrin, trichlorobenzene,
   heptachlor, trichlorophenol and trichloroethene) and for 8 metals,
   sufficient data were available. The aquatic toxicity data were
   multiplied by the partitioning coefficient in order to obtain aquatic
   data expressed in mg/kg. For some compounds the terrestrial toxicity
   data were significantly higher than the aquatic data but for other
   compounds it was the other way around. These differences indicate that
   the EqP-method can give significant over-or underestimations, due to
   inaccurate partitioning coefficients or differences in species
   sensitivities.
   These over- or underestimations can have an impact on the setting of
   environmental quality standards which are based on the hazardous
   concentration 5\% (HC5) values. The uncertainty in the calculation of
   HC5 values attributed to the use of the EqP-method, was quantified. The
   HC5 values derived using the EqP-method were in 5\% of the cases more
   than 20 times higher than the corresponding HC5 values that were derived
   directly from soil toxicity tests. Despite of this uncertainty the use
   of the EqP-method can still be advocated for setting soil quality
   guidelines when only a very limited number of terrestrial toxicity data
   are available. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic, process-based model of surface water acidification, MAGIC7.
   has been applied to four representative alpine lakes in the Tatra
   Mountains, (Slovakia and Poland). The model was calibrated for a set of
   12 to 22-year experimental records of lake water composition. Surface
   water and soil chemistry were reconstructed front 1860 to 2002 and
   forecast to 2 050 based on the reduction in sulphur and nitrogen
   emissions presupposed by the Gothenburg Protocol. Relatively small
   changes in the soil C:N ratios were not sufficient to simulate observed
   changes in NO3- concentrations, so an alternative empirical approach of
   changes in terrestrial N uptake was applied. Measured sulphate sorption
   isotherms did not allow calibration of the pattern of sulphate response
   in the lakes, indicating that other mechanisms of S release were also
   important. The lake water chemistry exhibited significant changes during
   both the acidification advance (1860 to 1980s) and retreat (1980s to
   2010). An increase in lake water concentrations of strong acid anions
   (SAA: 104-149 mueq l(-1)) was balanced by a decline in HCO3- (13-62 mueq
   l(-1)) and an increase in base cations (BC; 42-72 mueq l(-1)), H+ (0-18
   mueq l(-1)) and Al-i(n+) (0-26 mueq l(-1)). The carbonate buffering
   system was depleted in three lakes. In contrast, lake water
   concentrations of SAA, BC, H+ and Al-i(n+) decreased by 57-82, 28-42.
   0-11, and 0-22 mueq l(-1), respectively, the carbonate buffering system
   was re-established, and HCO3- increased by 1-21 mueq l(-1) during the
   chemical reversal from atmospheric acidification (by 2000). The MAGIC7
   model forecasts a slight continuation in this reversal for the next
   decade and new steady-state conditions thereafter. Gran alkalinity
   should come back to 1950s levels (0-71 mueq l(-1)) in all lakes after
   2010. Partial recovery of the soil pool of exchangeable base cations can
   be expected in one catchment, while only conservation of the current
   conditions is predicted for three lakes. Even though the pre-industrial
   alkalinity values of 16-80 mueq l(-1) will not be reached due to the
   insufficient recovery of soil quality, the ongoing chemical improvement
   of water should be sufficient for biological recovery of most alpine
   takes in the Tatra Mountains.}},

Abstract = {{A study was carried out during June 2002 to examine the impact of zero
   tillage in terms of changes in the cost structure, returns and
   resource-use efficiency in foothills region of Uttaranchal state of
   India, one of the major rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat(Triticum aestivum
   L. emend. Fiori \& Paol.) pockets of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The
   parameters such as yield increase, reduction in cost of production and
   technical and economic efficiency were used to assess the economic
   benefits. Determinants of technical efficiency in terms of the adoption
   of zero-tillage technology and producer characteristics were also
   examined. Impressive cost savings (28\%) was observed under zero tillage
   in wheat. The technology had positive and significant impact on
   environment and sustainability of the system through improved soil
   quality and reduction in use of inputs like chemical fertilizers,
   irrigation water, and energy. The results showed that education of
   farmer was the most important factor in achieving resource-use
   efficiency, while size of holding was the most important influencing
   factor in adoption of zero-tillage technology. The gains from the
   adoption of zero-tillage technology could further be improved with
   enhanced efficiency in resource use and a wider adoption of the
   technology through appropriate extension programmes.}},

Abstract = {{The current industrial pig production model is in crisis, due to its
   association with environmental pollution, doubtful product quality and
   lack of animal well-being. In Bretagne (France), a region of intensive
   pig production, a survey of seven stakeholder groups concerned with pig
   production was conducted, as part of a research programme dedicated to
   the assessment of the environmental impact of different modes of pig
   production. A very large majority of pig. producers (93\%) and their
   suppliers (100\%) considers pig farms as an asset for the region,
   whereas a majority of scientists (58\%), activists (78\%) and consumers
   (54\%) sees it as a handicap. Differences among stakeholder groups are
   minor with respect to the perceived importance of environmental and
   social issues. Stakeholders agree on the relative level of
   responsibility of pig farms with respect to specific problems. For all
   groups unpleasant odours and water quality come first with respect to
   responsibility, for most groups soil quality comes second, followed by
   product safety and air quality. For a future improved mode of pig
   production, 76\% of pig producers and their suppliers prefer to adapt
   the current model, for all other groups the majority prefers an
   alternative model. While pig producers and their suppliers prefer a
   slurry-based housing system, all other groups prefer a straw-based
   system. Pig producers see the slurry-based system as technically
   superior and associate the straw-based system with poor working
   conditions, whereas consumers associate the slurry-based system in the
   first place with poor water quality and associate the straw-based system
   with less pollution. These results will be of use in the research
   programme on the environmental impact of modes of pig production, as
   they indicate the environmental impacts to be considered and their
   relative importance. The results will also help in deciding which
   options should be assessed. It is concluded that the poor image of the
   current pig production model and its production practices with consumers
   does not seem compatible with a sustainable demand for pork products.

Abstract = {{Agriculture provides a major share of national income and export
   earnings in many developing countries while ensuring food security,
   income and employment to a large proportion of the population. Many
   people in developing countries rely on the land to sustain their
   livelihoods. Land may also inspire cultural and spiritual values, and
   more generally strengthen a sense of belonging. Fertile, good quality
   soils are an essential component for farming. Soil is a living system of
   organisms reacting with organic and inorganic matter. The soil quality
   comprises a range of chemical, physical and biological factors, which
   together affect the productive potential of the land. For our purposes,
   soil degradation can be defined as a permanent decline in the rate at
   which land yields products that are useful for sustaining livelihoods.
   Examples of soil degradation processes include erosion, declining soil
   organic matter, soil nutrient depletion, compaction, acidification,
   salinisation and soil pollution. In this research note, I examine the
   response by smallholder farmers in Eastern Africa to soil nutrient
   depletion using locally available resources.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality is defined as ``The capacity of a specific kind of soil to
   function within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain
   biological productivity, maintain environmental quality, and promote
   plant and animal health{''}. It is increasingly proposed as an
   integrative indicator of environmental quality, food security and
   economic viability. However, there are a number of constraints to
   adoption so that indices of soil quality can provide decision tools for
   policy-makers and help identify the most sustainable management
   practices for farmers and other land managers. The present research
   intends to develop a strategy for selecting minimum data set for soil
   quality indicators in the case area: the Loess Plateau of China, and to
   develop a conceptual framework for monitoring and modeling the dynamics
   of soil quality, and finally setup a Web-GIS-based information system to
   collect the data of soil quality change and predict its in response to
   potential disturbances.}},

   quality and fertility at seven established field experimental sites
   where biosolids have been applied for at least four years. These
   additions influenced several physical properties of the soil, increasing
   topsoil water-infiltration rates, plant-available water supply on a
   light sandy soil, soil porosity and bearing strength. There were also
   increases in the level of plant-available sulphur, magnesium, copper and
   boron. Liquid digested biosolids applications also increased the

   (MSWI) ashes on recipient experimental grasslands. Leachates from
   MSWI-bottom ashes (BA) and MSWI-solidified air pollution control
   residues (SAPCr) contained a large content of salts and may be a source
   of an important disturbance of biological functioning of soils or
   grassland in the neighbourhood of systems containing such residues.
   Leachates obtained from solid waste were spread on field experimental
   plots with indigenous grasses (herbaceous fallow) or with introduced
   vegetation (seedlings of an indigenous colonial bentgrass: Agrostis
   tenuis). After the spreading of leachates, some effects on vegetation
   (at day 180 and day 480) and on bacteria communities of soil (at day 90
   and at day 480) were assessed. On soil, a significant increasing of Na+
   percentage of the exchange complex (ESP) was observed. The colonial
   bentgrass was found to be more sensitive to BA phytotoxicity than
   indigenous grasses, with a decrease of root (43\%) and aerial (29\%)
   biomass 180 days following the contamination. Conversely, a positive
   effect on the biomass was observed following the addition of SAPCr
   leachate. The use of a molecular tool to assess the effects on soil
   eubacteria community (A-RISA) showed a significant large modification of
   the community structure with SAPCr leachate, when a low effect was
   observed with BA. Grass cover and root influence on the behaviour of the
   bacterial communities with respect to the leachates were shown.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in soil caused by drought and wildfire in a Dipterocarp
   rainforest in Sabah, Malaysia were assessed by phosphorus fractionation,
   extractable nitrogen and nutrient limited respiration kinetics (after
   addition of glucose + N or P). Fire increased the concentration of total
   phosphorus (P) in the litter layer (per ha and per dry soil) by raising
   the 0.2 M NaOH extractable-P. In the soil organic layer, membrane
   exchangeable P was reduced by fire while 1.0 M HCl extractable-P, and
   0.5 M NaHCO3 extractable-P increased. Microbially available P increased
   after the fire and was most closely related to NaOH extractable-P that
   has been considered available to plants only over long timescales. Total
   nitrogen (N) increased in the litter layer (per ha and per dry soil) due
   to post-fire litter fall, while the NO3- increased up to 10-fold down to
   the 10 cm mineral soil. In contrast, the microbially available N
   decreased by 50\%. Basal respiration and substrate-induced respiration
   increased in the litter layer and decreased in the organic horizon (per
   dry soil and per organic matter). P limited microbial growth resulted in
   a slow and non-exponential increase in respiration, presumably
   reflecting the P-fixing nature of the soils, while N limitation resulted
   in a fast exponential increase. However, higher respiration rates were
   eventually achieved under P limitation than under N limitation. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{By virtue of their physiological adaptability and metabolic versatility,
   bacteria in plant root zones are a key agent of change in soil
   agroecosystems. Interactions between plant root systems and
   rhizobacteria have a profound effect on crop health, yield, and soil
   quality. Through the selective release of exudates and leachates plants
   activate and sustain specific rhizobacterial communities in the root
   zone. In turn, root zone bacteria are able to generate a wide array of
   secondary metabolites which can have a positive influence on plant
   growth; enhancing the availability of minerals and nutrients, improving
   nitrogen fixation ability, decreasing susceptibility to frost damage,
   improving plant health through the biocontrol of phytopathogens,
   inducing systemic plant disease resistance, and facilitating plant
   establishment, growth and development. The benefits from root zone
   bacterial biodiversity are moot in managed agroecosystems, where
   community complexity is minimized, and ecosystem stability is often
   disrupted for the purpose of disease control and yield maximization. The
   complexity of plant-soil-microbial interactions are so varied, that a
   complete understanding of all the relationships involved is unlikely to
   be achieved, even in a production monoculture. Nevertheless, the
   consequences of beneficial biological interactions that stimulate crop
   yields and improve plant health can be evaluated relatively simply and a
   number of general management strategies can be devised accordinaly. (C)

Abstract = {{Manipulating soil microbial communities using soil and crop management
   practices is a basic strategy in developing sustainable agricultural
   systems. Sustainable farming is based, in part, on the efficient
   management of soil microorganisms to improve soil quality. However, the
   identification of biological indicators of soil quality that can be used
   to predict weed suppression in soils has received little attention. We
   investigated differences in soil microbial activity among various crop
   and soil management systems to assess: (i) the microbiological
   characteristics of these soils; (ii) determine whether any relationships
   existed that might be used in the development of weed suppression. Soil
   enzyme activity, water-stable aggregates, and the proportions of
   weed-suppressive bacteria were compared among seven cropping systems and
   one native-prairie ecosystem in mid-Missouri, USA. Assays of soil
   enzymes (fluorescein diacetate hydrolase, dehydrogenase, phosphatase)
   revealed that organic and integrated cropping systems, and the
   native-prairie ecosystem had the highest levels of soil activity. Weed
   rhizospheres from these same ecosystems also had greater proportions of
   bacterial isolates characterized as ``growth suppressive{''} to green
   foxtail (Setaria viridis {[}L.] Beauv.) and field bindweed (Convolvulus
   arvensis L.): 15 and 10\%, respectively. The proportion of water-stable
   soil aggregates was the greatest in soils with the highest organic
   matter and was found to be related to higher enzyme and weed-suppressive
   activity. Selected biological indicators of soil quality were associated
   with potential weed-suppressive activity in soil when that soil was
   managed for high organic matter content under reduced tillage systems.
   This research study provides further evidence that soil quality and
   sustainable agricultural practices may be linked to integrated weed
   management systems for the biological suppression of weeds. Published by

Abstract = {{This study investigated the influence of harvest residue management
   practices on soil, organic matter (SOM) composition and quality from two
   second-rotation Eucalyptus globulus plantations in southwestern
   Australia, using solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   spectroscopy with cross-polarisation and magic-angle-spinning (CPMAS).
   Soil samples (0-5 cm) were collected every 12 months for 5 years from
   two sites that had. contrasting soil types and fertility. Harvest
   residue management treatments established at both sites were (a) no
   harvest residues; and (b) double harvest residues. The use of C-13 CPMAS
   and DD NMR spectroscopy enabled the successful non-destructive detection
   of SOM quality changes in the two E. globulus plantations. Relative
   intensities of C-13 CPMAS NMR spectral regions were similar at both
   sites, and for both harvest residue treatments, indicating that SOM
   composition was also similar.. Dipolar. dephasing (DD) NMR. spectra
   revealed resonances in SOM assigned to lignin and tannin structures,
   with larger resonances in the carbonyl and alkyl C regions that were
   indicative of cuticular material, enabling detection of changes in SOM
   quality. Retention of double harvest residues on the soil surface
   increased the soil quality compared with removal of all harvest residues
   at both sites as indicated by the NMR aromaticities, but this was most
   noticeable at Manjimup, which had greater initial soil fertility. (C)

Abstract = {{Nitrification potential is the maximum capacity of a soil's population
   of nitrifying bacteria to transform NH4+-N to NO3--N. Time of season and
   the effect of several management practices on nitrification potentials
   were measured via an amended slurry method, shaken for 24 h at 25
   degreesC. Management strategies that reduce potential nitrification
   rates without limiting plant N uptake may increase the ratio of plant
   biomass to plant N content (PB:N), the aboveground net primary
   production (ANPP) per unit of N in ANPP, and decrease the amount of NO3-
   available for leaching, and/or conversion to N2O. Sites were located in
   Hickory Corners, MI, USA, on Haplic Luvisols. Management practices
   included: substitution of compost for N fertilizer, use of a rotation in
   place of continuous maize and the addition of cover crops. A previously
   tilled, successional grassland was used as a contrast to agricultural
   managements. Where N fertilizer was applied, nitrification potential
   increased in late May and again in late August-October. The seasonal
   pattern was similar but less pronounced where compost was applied.
   Nitrification rates were 4.2 times greater than that of the successional
   site when N fertilizer was applied. Use of N fertilizer increased
   nitrification potentials 1.5 times above treatments where compost was
   applied during 1998 and 1999 in the 6th and 7th years of the rotation.
   In some instances, nitrification potentials could be correlated with in
   situ NO3--N measurements. Average PB:Ns in the fertilizer management
   were greater or equivalent to the successional grassland site. Compost
   increased PB:N above that of N fertilizer. Utilization of compost
   decreased nitrification potentials, maintained yields, and increased
   PB:N. The crop N content was lower when compost was applied. Thus, grain
   and stover quality may be lowered and need to be monitored. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{This paper describes a dynamic simulation model that integrates
   environmental and economic components of agricultural crop production
   systems to predict changes in soil quality and the concomitant impact on
   economic returns. The model is used to simulate crop yield, soil quality
   and economic performance of a conventional crop rotation and several
   alternative crop rotations in two contrasting environments in western
   Canada over a 50-year period. This information is used to quantify the
   impact of the crop rotations on soil organic carbon (SOC) and the
   economic value of on-site SOC changes. The estimated value of these
   impacts range from \$0.20/t to \$2.10/t of SOC/ha/yr.}},

Abstract = {{Compost has been shown to have a range of positive impacts on soil
   quality and can provide an important source of nutrients for plants.
   While these benefits have been. documented for many finished composts,
   there is presently little understanding of the impact of composting
   process conditions-and the extent of compost decomposition on soil C and
   N mineralization after compost incorporation. This study evaluated the
   impact of composting process conditions and the extent of compost
   decomposition on soil C and N mineralization after compost
   incorporation. Dried, ground composts were blended with equal parts of
   quartz sand and soil and incubated aerobically for 28 d at 30 degreesC.
   Cumulative respired CO2-C and net mineralized N were quantified. Results
   indicate that (1) organic substrates that did not degrade due to
   sub-optimal conditions during the composting process can readily
   mineralize after incorporation in soil; (2) C and N cycling dynamics in
   soil after compost incorporation can be affected by compost feedstock,
   processing conditions, and time; and (3) denitrification after compost
   incorporation in soil can limit N availability from compost. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Studies on the effect of land use alteration on the spatial variability
   of soil properties are limited. This study addressed the spatial and
   temporal variability of soil properties and changes of soil quality in a
   hill region of subtropical China using geostatistical methods. Soil
   samples from 0- to 15-cm depth were collected within 105 locations, on a
   100 x 100 m grid basis over a 112-ha field, in 1985 and 1997,
   respectively. Soil properties showed large variability, with the highest
   coefficient of variation being observed for available P, the lowest for
   soil pH. Over the 12-year period, a significant decrease of soil organic
   matter appeared with original land use patterns of wasteland and paddy
   field, whereas other properties showed no significant changes. In
   addition to the alteration of wasteland, fertilization in upland
   increased available P and K, whereas the opposite appeared in forest
   restoration system. Changing wasteland into paddy field was found to
   increase soil fertility. A geostatistical analysis showed that all the
   soil properties (pH, organic mater, available P and K) and their changes
   between 1985 and 1997 were spatially structured. The nugget-to-sill
   ratio indicates a strong spatial dependence for soil pH, and a moderate
   spatial dependence for other properties. The ranges for soil properties
   in 1985 were equal to or larger than the diameter of the hills. Changing
   the land use patterns decreased the ranges for soil chemical properties.
   The ranges for soil pH and available K were similar to the radius of
   hills. Interpolation using kriging showed a spatial similarity among the
   soil properties. Soil properties decreased in the southeast quadrant of
   the research area where the land use was paddy field, while they
   increased around the center where arable upland was initially from
   wasteland. Thus, we propose a process to evaluate soil quality using the
   geostatistical methods as a potential analysis tool for monitoring
   changes at a farm scale. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Alternative land use systems, and especially agroforestry, are currently
   being promoted in the Three Gorges area to enhance soil retention and
   improve soil quality. The soil microbial biomass (C-mic) is intimately
   associated with the build up of organic matter (C,,). Different land
   uses including mixed cropping systems were compared with respect to
   their soil microbial biomass, basal respiration (R), the C-mic/C-org
   ratio and metabolic quotient. Microbial biomass C of citrus/wheat soils
   ranged widely from 54 to 194 mug g(-1) soil and formed 0.48-2.11\% of
   the total organic C. For forests, citrus/wheat (wheat area) and tea
   bush, microbial biomass C as a percent of soil organic C were roughly
   four times that for citrus and citrus/wheat (citrus area). There were no
   significant differences between tea bush and forest in microbial biomass
   C, respiration rate and metabolic quotient. Significant relationships
   between microbial biomass C, C-mic/C-org ratio and readily available N
   were found for all samples except citrus/wheat (wheat area) and forest
   soils. Terraced systems and especially terraced agroforestry promoted
   the retention of organic matter and this was reflected in the microbial
   indicators. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil microbial properties were studied from localities on a transect
   along the Yenisei River, Central Siberia. The 1000 km-long transect,
   from 56degreesN to 68degreesN, passed through tundra, taiga and pine
   forest characteristic of Northern Russia. Soil microbial properties were
   characterized by dehydrogenase activity, microbial biomass, composition
   of microbial community (PLFAs), respiration rates, denitrification and N
   mineralization rates. Relationships between vegetation, latitude, soil
   quality (pH, texture), soil organic carbon (SOC) and the microbial
   properties were examined using multivariate analysis. In addition, the
   temperature responses of microbial growth (net growth rate) and activity
   (soil respiration rate) were tested by laboratory experiments. The major
   conclusions of the study are as follows:
   1. Multivariate analysis of the data revealed significant differences in
   microbial activity. SOC clay content was positively related to clay
   content. Soil texture and SOC exhibited the dominant effect on soil
   microbial parameters, while the vegetation and climatic effects
   (expressed as a function of latitude) were weaker but still significant.
   The effect of vegetation cover is linked to SOC quality, which can
   control soil microbial activity.
   2. When compared to fine-textured soils, coarse-textured soils have (i)
   proportionally more SOC bound in microbial biomass, which might result
   in higher susceptibility of SOC transformation to fluctuation of
   environmental factors, and (ii) low mineralization potential, but with a
   substantial part of the consumed C being transformed to microbial
   products.
   3. The soil microbial community from the northernmost study region
   located within the permafrost zone appears to be adapted to cold
   conditions. As a result, microbial net growth rate became negative when
   temperature rose above 5 degreesC and C mineralization then exceeded C
   accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy metal pollution of soil has been recognized as a major factor
   impeding soil microbial processes. From this perspective, we studied
   responses of the soil biological activities to metal stress simulated by
   soil amendment with Zn, Pb, and Cd chlorides. The amounts of heavy metal
   salts added to five metal-polluted soils and four nonpolluted soils were
   selected to match the total metal concentrations typically found in
   polluted soils of the Silesia region of Poland. From the perspective of
   soil quality, metal mobility in amended soils could not be described by
   simple functions of pH or organic matter. Reaction of Pb with the soil
   caused strong immobilization with less than 1\% of the Pb amendment
   recovered by 0-01 M CaCl2 extractions. Immobilization of Cd was also
   significant, whereas immobilization of the Zn amendment was much weaker
   than that of Cd or Pb. The Zn amendment had substantial inhibitory
   effect on soil dehydrogenase, acid and alkaline phosphatase,
   arylsulfatase, urease, and nitrification potential. Generally, Cd and Pb
   had limited or stimulatory effect on most of these biological
   activities, with an exception of Pb strongly inhibiting soil urease. The
   effect of the metal amendments on biological activities could not be
   satisfactorily accounted for by metal toxicity because no strong
   relationship was observed between extractable metal content and the
   degree of inhibition. The Zn amendment had a significant effect on soil
   pH, resulting in confounding effects of pH and Zn toxicity on
   activities. Metal amendment experiments seem to be of limited utility
   for meaningful assessment of metal contamination effects on soil
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade, soil quality research and education programs
   have increased exponentially throughout the world. Educational and
   assessment approaches, ranging from simple scorecard and test-kit
   monitoring to comprehensive quantitative assessments and indexing using
   soils databases, have been pursued. The programs have emphasized that
   soil quality is not ``an end in itself{''} but rather a tool for
   evaluating and understanding the effects of soil management on a
   specific soil resource. The approaches have stressed that to determine
   how well a soil is functioning, inherent and dynamic soil properties and
   processes must be evaluated using biological, chemical, and physical
   indicators. No soil quality researcher has ever envisioned the concept
   would replace modern soil survey programs or diminish the importance of
   scientifically based soil management strategies. Herein, we present the
   scientific merits of soil quality research.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality is a concept that has deeply divided the soil science
   community. It has been institutionalized and advocated without full
   consideration of concept weaknesses and contradictions. Our paper
   highlights its disfunctional definition, flawed approach to
   quantification, and failure to integrate simultaneous functions, which
   often require contradictory soil properties and/or management. While the
   concept arose from a call to protect the environment and sustain the
   soil resource, soil quality indexing as implemented may actually impair
   some soil functions, environmental quality, or other societal
   priorities. We offer the alternative view that emphasis on known
   principles of soil management is a better expenditure of limited
   resources for soil stewardship than developing and deploying subjective
   indices which fait to integrate across the necessary spectrum of
   management outcomes. If the soil quality concept is retained, we suggest
   precisely specifying soil use, not function or capacity, as the criteria
   for attribute evaluation. Emphasis should be directed toward using
   available technical information to motivate and educate farmers on
   management practices that optimize the combined goals of high crop
   production, low environmental degradation, and a sustained resource.}},

   determining biodegradability and material disintegration are established

   routine use. In the past, biotests have been developed and optimised
   solely for investigations of single chemicals. Such tests are applicable
   even if they are not validated for the detection of undesired
   ecotoxicological effects deriving from biodegradation of polymers in
   soil. Since the biodegradation process does have an influence on the

   biotests and chemical analysis are required in many cases. Theory,

   mineralization of N and C, and microbial activity. We studied the
   short-term effects of two types of tillage (conventional plough- and a
   non-inverting-tillage) on mineralization and microbial N and C pools in
   a sandy loam under organic plough-tillage management. The release of
   active and protected (inactive) N by tillage was further studied in the
   laboratory by Use Of N-15 labelling of the active pool of soil N
   followed by simulation of tillage by sieving through a 2 mm sieve.
   Results showed that the two types of tillage as well as the simulation
   of tillage had very few effects on mineralization and microbial pools.
   The simulation of tillage caused, however, a small release of N from a
   pool which was otherwise protected against microbial degradation. The
   use of soil crushing for disruption of larger macroaggregates (> 425
   mum) and chloroform fumigation for perturbation of the microbial biomass
   increased the release from both active and protected N pools. The
   relative contribution from the protected N pool was, however, similar in
   the three treatments (22-27\%), thus the pools subjected to
   mineralization were characterised by similar degree of protection. On
   the basis of isotopic composition the pools of N mineralised were
   indistinguishable. This suggests that the released N originated from the
   same pool, that is the soil microbial biomass. The study points to the
   microbial pool as the main source of labile N which may be released by
   tillage, and thus to its importance for sustained soil fertility in
   agricultural systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Due to severe land degradation problems, soil conservation is a matter
   of major concern in the Ecuadorian Andes. Slow-forming terraces, a
   variation of hedgerow agro-forestry systems composed by contour grass
   barrier strips, can be considered as the most frequently used technique
   in Andean rural communities of Ecuador. However, due to shallow soils,
   terrace development often has the disadvantage causing gradients in soil
   properties from the upper to the lower elevations within the terrace.
   The main objectives of this study were to assess (i) spatial variability
   in soil properties on slow-forming terraces in the Andes and (ii)
   implications of variability for the management of this soil conservation
   technique. In order to measure spatial variability, soil sampling (0-15
   cm) was carried out in bands following the contour, which were located
   every I m beginning at the highest point of elevation and including the
   lowest point on the terrace. Soil properties, such as pH(H2O), pH(NaF),
   organic carbon, total nitrogen, NO3-, P, K, exchangeable aluminium, P
   fixation, exchangeable bases, cationic exchange capacity, base
   saturation and texture, were monitored on eight terraces, having slopes
   from 15 to 30\%, a length of 4-8 m and soils ranging from Cambisols to
   Phaeozems, in the Ecuadorian Andes (Gima, Azuay). Terraces, which were
   2-4 years, were managed in a traditional or more intensified way (i.e.
   without or with the application of organic manure). Bufferstrips were
   composed by (i) Pennisetum clandestinum and Lolium multiflorum or (ii)
   Phalaris tuberosa. Spatial variability was analysed by stepwise multiple
   regression analysis, where position on the terrace was the independent
   variable and soil property was the dependent variable. Factor analysis
   was carried out in order to compare spatial variability patterns of the
   terraces and formulate management strategies. High spatial variability
   in soil properties was found. Although spatial variation was site
   dependent, it was clear that soil fertility increased from the upper to
   the lower part of the terraces. The present study shows that management
   strategy could influence the pattern and magnitude of spatial variation.
   Site-specific soil fertility improvement is suggested as means to combat
   variation caused by tillage erosion in slow-forming terraces. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Intensive maize (Zea mays L.) cropping based on conventional tillage
   practices has resulted in soil quality degradation in the Patzcuaro
   Watershed in central Mexico. A field experiment with seven soil
   management treatments was implemented on a sandy loam Andisol to
   evaluate the impact on soil quality of maize cropping with conventional
   tillage, no-tillage with varying percentages of surface residue coverage
   (0, 33, 66 and 100\%), and no-tillage with 33\% residue coverage
   together with cover crops of either Vicia sp. or Phaseolus vulgaris L.
   The treatments of no-tillage under crop residue coverage were
   established in 1995 and the leguminous species were planted in 1998. By
   2000, the alternative management treatments had increased soil enzymes,
   soil organic C, biodegradable C fractions such as water soluble C, water
   soluble carbohydrates, and microbial biomass C, and soil wet aggregate
   stability, compared to the CT treatment. Wet aggregate stability was
   increased by adopting no-tillage and even further by additional residue.
   Most soil quality characteristics improved in direct proportion to
   residue inputs. The use of no-tillage management together with a
   moderate amount of crop residue (33\%) and planted to leguminous species
   rapidly improved some soil quality characteristics. We conclude that
   conservation tillage practices can provide an alternative technology
   contributing to sustainable agriculture in the Patzcuaro watershed of
   Mexico, which can be extrapolated to similar areas elsewhere in Latin
   America. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable agriculture requires an adequate analysis framework. Fuzzy
   logic-based and field scale indicators were developed to evaluate the
   effects of pesticides and tillage on agroecosystems. All the assumptions
   and rules for making inferences reflect the current knowledge and the
   expert perception and judgment about the potential environmental impact
   of pesticides and tillage. The proposed indicators require four input
   variables: (1) number and type of applied pesticides, (2) rate of
   applied pesticides, (3) number and type of tillage tools, and (4) land
   capability class of each field. In regards to pesticide impact, the
   indicators consider the toxicity effects on: (1) mammals and (2)
   insects, while the tillage impact is evaluated taking into account the
   effects of different tillage operations on: (1) the retention of crop
   stubble on the soil surface, and (2) the stability of soil aggregates.
   Two overall outputs were obtained: (1) pesticide index and (2) tillage
   index. The developed indicators were used to compare the potential
   environmental effect of current practices carried out in Inland Pampa
   (Argentina). Concerning pesticide use, cropping winter wheat did less
   harm to the agroecosystem than cropping maize and sunflower. The overall
   values of tillage index were similar within crops. However, large
   differences in pesticide and tillage effects were found among tillage
   systems. Soybean showed the highest variability in both indexes. The
   type of analysis carried out in this study using farm-level variables
   may help find more sustainable ways to manage agricultural inputs. (C)

Abstract = {{This laboratory incubation study was conducted to evaluate the effect of
   municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) as a soil amendment on soil quality
   indicators, such as microbial biomass, and their activities. The MSWC
   was compared against cow dung manure (CDM), a traditional organic
   supplement. The comparative study was carried out in water regimes of
   60\% water holding capacity (WH) of soil and under waterlogged (WL)
   condition. MSWC was applied to an alluvial soil (Typic Fluvaquent) at
   the rates of 0, 2.5, 10, 20 and 40 and CDM at 0, 20 and 40 t/ha.
   Microbial biomass-C (MBC), glucose induced soil respiration (SR), urease
   and acid phosphatase activities in soil were analyzed following 15, 30,
   45, 60, 90 and 120 days of incubation. The parameters studied were
   significantly higher in CDM-treated than in MSWC-treated soils. Increase
   in graded doses of MSWC from 2.5 to 40 t/ha substantially increased the
   MBC, SR, urease and phosphatase activities in the soil. In 60\% WH
   regime, MBC and SR increased for the first 30 days of incubation and
   then declined. Under the WL regime, the MBC declined while SR increased
   from 15 days till 120 days of incubation. Urease and phosphatase
   activities of soil increased for up to 60 days during incubation in 60\%
   WH regime and then decreased. Activities of both the enzymes under WL
   regime decreased progressively during incubation. There were no negative
   impacts on the soil quality indicators from high application rates of
   MSWC.}},

Abstract = {{Laundry effluent has the potentials to affect soil physicochemical

   topsoil from twelve sites in Edo State were treated with composite
   mixtures of liquid effluents obtained from six laundry industries and

   topsoil with laundry effluent resulted in significant increase (P=0.05)
   in pH, available phosphorus, exchangeable sodium, potassium,
   exchangeable sodium percentage, percentage base saturation, soil
   buffering capacity and a significant decrease (P=0.05) in calcium,
   hydrogen and cation exchange capacity. There was no significant
   difference between the untreated and treated soils with respect to the
   organic carbon, nitrogen, magnesium and the distribution of clay, silt
   and sand. Thus, the treatment with laundry effluent showed a tendency to
   reduce soil quality with respect to sodium, exchangeable sodium

Abstract = {{Hardwood rangelands in California, which are commonly used for cattle
   production, are characterized by an oak overstory and annual grass
   understory. Our goal was to evaluate how canopies influence
   nitrogen-cycling processes and how tree removal affected these
   processes. We measured standing ammonium and nitrate pools, gross
   production and consumption of NH4 and NO3, nitrification potentials, and
   NOx, and N2O emissions in soils under oak canopies and in open grassy
   areas over a two-year period in areas within the same watershed that
   were grazed by cattle or fenced to exclude cattle. We also performed a
   subset of these measurements in open areas and in plots near stumps of
   oaks in areas that had been clear-cut seven and nine years earlier.
   Nitrogen turnover was generally higher in canopy area soils than in open
   area soils, and higher in the grazed area than in the fenced area.
   Ammonium production was slow following first autumn wet-up, but achieved
   higher rates during the growing season. By contrast, NO, production
   showed no discernible seasonal pattern. Inorganic N consumption
   generally balanced production, such that inorganic N only accumulated
   over summer. N gas emissions were generally <1 ng N(.)cm(-2.)h(-)1,
   except for one measurement period during an autumn rain, when total NOx
   plus N2O flux was 13 ng N(.)cm(-2.)h(-1). In the clear-cut areas,
   properties of canopy-removed soils were converging with open area soil
   properties, with declining N capitals and nitrification potentials. The
   results demonstrate active N turnover in soils associated with oak
   trees, with tree removal appearing to reduce both the soil nitrogen
   capital and N-cycling rates.}},

Abstract = {{The soil quality concept evolved throughout the 1990s in response to
   increased global emphasis on sustainable land use and with a holistic
   focus emphasizing that sustainable soil management requires more than
   soil erosion control. The concept includes two areas of
   emphasis-education and assessment-both based soundly on principles of
   soil science. Soil quality test kits, farmer-based scorecards, visual
   assessment procedures, fact sheets, and video presentations were
   developed as educational materials because many people have no basis to
   recognize, understand or appreciate the complexity of soil resources.
   Assessment tools for indexing soil quality at various scales were
   pursued to show the multiple functions (e.g. nutrient and water cycling,
   filtering and buffering of contaminants, decomposition of crop residues
   and other organic matter sources, and recycling of essential plant
   nutrients) that soils provide as the foundation for sustainable land
   management. Worldwide research and technology transfer efforts have
   increased awareness that soil resources have both inherent
   characteristics determined by their basic soil formation factors and
   dynamic characteristics influenced by human decisions and management
   practices. Soil quality assessment and education are intended to provide
   a better understanding and awareness that soil resources are truly
   living bodies with biological, chemical, and physical properties and
   processes performing essential ecosystem services. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The soil quality paradigm was originally developed in the temperate
   region with the overarching objective of approaching air quality and
   water quality standards. Although holistic and systems-oriented, soil
   quality focused principally on issues arising from large nutrient and
   energy inputs to agricultural lands. Soil quality in the tropics,
   however, focuses on three overarching concerns: food insecurity, rural
   poverty and ecosystem degradation. Soil science in the tropics relies
   heavily on quantitative attributes of soils that can be measured. The
   emotional, value-laden and ``measure everything{''} approach proposed by
   some proponents of the soil quality paradigm has no place in the
   tropics. Soil quality in the tropics must be considered a component of
   an integrated natural resource management framework (INRM). Based on
   quantitative topsoil attributes and soil taxonomy, the fertility
   capability soil classification (FCC) system is probably a good starting
   point to approach soil quality for the tropics and is widely used. FCC
   does not deal with soil attributes that can change in less than 1 year,
   but those that are either dynamic at time scales of years or decades
   with management, as well as inherent ones that do not change in less
   than a century. FCC attributes can be positive or negative depending on
   the land use as well as the temporal and spatial scales in question.
   Version 4 is introduced in this paper. The main changes are to include
   the former h condition modifier (acid, but not Al-toxic) with ``no major
   chemical limitations{''} because field experience has shown little
   difference between the two and to introduce a new condition modifier m
   that denotes organic carbon saturation deficit. Additional modifiers are
   needed for nutrient depletion, compaction, surface sealing and other
   soil biological attributes, but there is no sufficient evidence to
   propose robust, quantitative threshold values at this time. The authors
   call on those actively involved in linking these attributes with plant
   growth and ecosystem functions to provide additional suggestions that
   would enhance FCC. The use of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS)
   shows great potential on a wide range of tropical soils. The evolution
   of soil science from a qualitative art into a}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality (SQ) assessment tools may facilitate adaptive management
   decisions that promote sustainable agricultural practices. However,
   without input from the target audience, these decision tools' potential
   for adoption remains unknown. In an effort to consider the end-user in
   SQ index development, we examined fanner reactions to index outcomes and
   uses for soil quality information. We calculated SQ indices for
   side-by-side comparisons of alternative (organic amendment) and
   conventional practices in the San Joaquin Valley, CA. The indices
   integrated chemical, biological, and physical data collected over 3
   years in a participatory, on-farm demonstration project. In a focus
   group format, we asked the participating farmers about their perceptions
   of SQ in the study fields. We then asked the farmers to compare their
   perceptions with the calculated SQ indices by rating the amount of
   agreement between the two on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being
   excellent agreement. The survey results showed a mean of 8 and standard
   deviation = 1 (N = 12). When we presented all participants with a
   variety of output options for soil quality indicator information, they
   were asked to rate each for usefulness and understandability. The
   apparent disparity among their preferences (high ratings for the most
   and the least integrated data) was explained by the suggestion of
   several farmers that it would be most useful to have access to several
   forms of the information. Participants also discussed how they would
   most likely use the tools and what information would be needed for them
   to change a management practice. A demonstrated link between soil
   quality and economics was the most discussed need. In response to the
   farmers' emphasis on economic outcomes, we compared our SQ index with
   yield results (as one component of net revenue) for participating
   fields. Pearson correlation coefficients showed statistically
   significant correlations between yield and SQ index outcomes.
   Correlations were stronger within subsets of the data grouped by crop or
   soil suborder.}},

Abstract = {{How has soil quality changed in California over the past 60 years? Using
   the known locations of archived samples collected by the soil survey
   staff in the 1940s and 1950s, we resampled 125 locations in California
   from the Imperial Valley in the south to Tehama county in the north and
   analyzed samples for properties important to plant production. We
   collected three samples from the 0- to 25-cm depth at each location and
   air-dried them for analysis. For each 1945 and 2001 sample pH,
   electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, total carbon, plant available
   phosphorus, texture and color was measured. We compared the data across
   the entire state as well as by current land-use, and geographic region.
   Across the state, plant-available phosphorus, total carbon, pH, and
   percent clay increased significantly (95\% confidence level) as did
   percent silt and total nitrogen (90\% confidence). In contrast,
   electrical conductivity, and percent sand decreased significantly (95\%
   confidence). Chroma also decreased significantly statewide (90\%
   confidence level). The degree of change varied according to land-use and
   geographic region. Based on this sample, California's soil quality has
   not significantly decreased over the past 60 years. These results also
   suggest that defining and evaluating soil quality is difficult due to
   conflicting trends and interpretations of soil quality indices. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Salt-affected soils could produce useful forages when, irrigated with
   saline drainage water. To assess the productive potential and
   sustainability of using drainage water for forage production, a
   saline-sodic site (32.4 ha) in California's San Joaquin Valley was
   characterized for soil quality. The objectives were (1) to spatially
   characterize initial soil physicochemical properties relevant to
   maintaining soil quality on an and zone soil and (2) to characterize
   soil quality relationships and spatial variability.
   An initial mobile electromagnetic (EM) induction survey was conducted in
   1999, with bulk soil electrical conductivity (ECa) readings taken at 384
   geo-referenced locations, followed by an intensive mobile fixed-array
   survey with a total of 7288 geo-referenced ECa readings. Using the EM
   data and a spatial statistics program (ESAP v2.0), 40 sites were
   selected that reflected the spatial heterogeneity of the ECa
   measurements for the study area. At these sites, soil-core samples were
   taken at 0.3-m intervals to a depth of 1.2 m. Duplicate samples were
   taken at eight sites to study the local-scale variability of soil
   properties. Soil-core samples were analyzed for a variety of physical
   and chemical properties related to the soil quality of and zone soils.
   Soils were found to be highly spatially heterogeneous. For composite
   soil-core samples taken to a depth of 1.2 m, ECe (electrical
   conductivity of the saturation extract) varied from 12.8 to 36.6 dS
   m(-1), SAR from 28.8 to 88.8, and clay content from 2.5\% to 48.3\%. B
   and Mo concentrations varied from 11.5 to 32.2 mg l(-1) and 476.8 to
   1959.6 mug l(-1), respectively. CaCO3, NO3- in the saturation extract,
   exchangeable Ca2+, Se, and As consistently had the highest coefficients
   of variation (CV) while pH(e), Pb, and Ca2+ in the saturation extract
   consistently had the lowest CVs at all depths. A one-way analysis of
   variance (ANOVA) was used to spatially partition the local- and
   global-scale variability. Local-scale variability was greatest for pH,.
   Laboratory measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) were
   very low (0.0000846-0.0456 cm h(-1)), whereas field measurements were
   considerably higher (0.49-1.79 cm h(-1)). Based on the Cl- data, the
   leaching fraction (LF) for the entire study area was estimated to be
   17\%.
   Soil quality was reflected in yield and chemical analysis of forage.
   Forage Mo contents determined from newly established Bermuda grass
   varied from 1 to 5 mg kg(-1) on a dry matter basis, and Cu/Mo ratios
   averaged 3.3, while forage yield in the establishment year declined with
   ECe, and failed to grow above ECe levels of approximately 22 dS m(-1).
   The initial soil quality assessment of the research site indicated that
   the sustainability of drainage water reuse at this location would depend
   upon maintaining, a sufficient LF with careful consideration and
   management of salinity, boron, molybdenum, and sodium levels. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The properties of soils may be characterized by many attributes.
   However, there is not a systematic procedure to objectively select the
   measurement parameters that may be used to assess soil quality.
   Following the data collection, it is often a dilemma to decide how many
   and which of the measured parameters should be included in the
   assessment as the outcomes may be influenced by the parameters included.
   In this study, 29 physical, chemical, and biological attributes of soils
   at a long-term reclaimed wastewater-irrigated field in Bakersfield, CA
   and its adjacent non-wastewater-irrigated control were determined with
   samples collected along a 100-m transect at 1-m interval. The fields
   have been cultivated with varieties of field crops over the past 70
   years. The spatial variability of the data was evaluated. The principal
   component method was employed to identify the soil attributes that were
   most significant in describing variances of the fields. Soil quality of
   the treated and control fields were compared using the principal
   components identified in this process. Results indicated that the soil
   quality might be evaluated by comparing the total porosity (or drainable
   porosity), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus
   (P), and zinc (Zn) of soils in the control and the treated fields.
   Except for the total porosity and Mg, the other soil parameters of the
   control and treated fields were not significantly different. While the
   soils of both fields support successful crop production, the reclaimed
   wastewater irrigation appeared to slightly increase the soil compaction
   and reduce the soil's capacity of holding nutrient elements, such as Mg.

Abstract = {{Rapid methods for characterizing soil microbial communities are
   essential to assess responses to perturbations and to improved
   management practices. This study compared the composition of microbial
   communities in 47 agricultural soil and adjacent land use samples
   collected in the San Joaquin Valley, CA. Microbial communities were
   characterized by DNA fingerprinting of the Intergenic Transcribed Spacer
   (ITS) region, using primers universal for bacteria or eucarya. Bacterial
   DNA fingerprints were more complex (containing 25-30 bands) than were
   eucaryotic fingerprints (8-15 bands). Field replicates from within an
   agricultural field were more similar to one another than samples
   collected in different fields under the same crop type or in close
   proximity to one another. Microbial communities in almond, grape, and
   tomato soils across different locations were more similar to one another
   than communities in cotton and safflower soils. Bacterial DNA
   fingerprints were significantly correlated with soil electrical
   conductivity, soil texture, inorganic carbon, and nitrogen content but
   not with pH and organic carbon content. The grouping of soil samples
   based on their soil reflectance properties was similar to the grouping
   based on the bacterial ITS analysis. Despite similarities among
   communities under some crops and at some locations, there is tremendous
   unexplained diversity within agricultural soil microbial communities.
   More extensive sampling is needed to better understand the driving
   forces underlying microbial community composition. (C) 2003 Published by

Abstract = {{The short-term responses of soil microbial processes and community
   structure to perturbation constitute one aspect of soil quality. Such
   responses are often associated with an increase in the emissions of
   greenhouse gases (i.e., CO2, NO, or N2O) and the accumulation and
   potential loss of nitrate by leaching. Here we describe our recent work
   on responses of soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics, microbial biomass,
   and microbial community structure to a tillage event in intensively
   managed vegetable crop systems in California. Our results indicate that
   CO2 emission is high for the first day after tillage, but respiration
   declines or remains constant, suggesting that physical processes are
   responsible for the high flux from the soil surface. Net mineralization
   and nitrate accumulation increase for several days after tillage, and
   this can be accompanied by higher denitrification rates. Tillage causes
   immediate changes in microbial community structure, based on
   phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, but little concomitant change
   in total microbial biomass. Tillage events contribute to decreased soil
   quality by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases, and increasing the
   potential for nitrate leaching to groundwater, and these negative
   aspects must be weighed against the benefits of tillage for increasing
   the health and productivity of some crops. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Redox status is one of the more difficult soil quality criteria to
   characterize especially in paddy soils. The soil system chosen in this
   study was an ongoing paddy field trial on alternative practices of
   incorporating rice straw instead of traditional burning of straw. Upon
   flooding, rapid changes in redox potential (Eh) occur in paddy soil due
   to the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), including rice straw.
   This investigation evaluated three methods of characterizing redox
   status: (i) Eh, a conventional method using Pt black electrode; (ii)
   terminal electron-accepting processes (TEAPs), a method of diagnosing
   microbially mediated electron acceptor (oxidized species) consumption,
   intermediate product concentration of H-2 and accumulation of final
   products (reduced species); and (iii) oxidative capacity (OXC), a
   comprehensive analysis of the algebraic sum of oxidized and reduced
   species into a single descriptive parameter. There was a need to develop
   a sampling technique for anaerobic soil pore water in rice paddy
   (without exposure to the atmosphere) to measure all the redox parameters
   required by these methods. The setup comprised of a capped piezometer
   (sampling well) back-filled with sand and sealed with bentonite, and
   vacuum extraction of pore water containing dissolved constituents. The
   pore water containing dissolved gases was collected into previously
   evacuated 400-ml two-port PVC bags from which gaseous phase subsamples
   were withdrawn with a syringe into 10-ml vacutainers previously flushed
   with N-2 gas for H2 and CH4 determinations in the laboratory. Unstable
   water quality parameters such as DO, Eh, pH and S2- were measured on
   site using fresh samples, while other parameters such as NO3-, SO2-, EC,
   Fe(II) and Fe(III), and Mn(II) were analyzed in the laboratory.
   The above three methods of evaluating redox status were applied to
   monitoring the paddy pore water over 3 years of field observations
   (1997-1999). Eh is a simple measure, but it gives at best only
   qualitative assessment of redox status because this electrode may not
   respond to many of the important redox couples. The adaptation of TEAPs
   to assess non-equilibrium redox conditions in flow pathways in
   large-scale ground water systems to small-scale rice rootzone was not
   entirely successful because of differences in the two systems and the
   significant overlapping among electron acceptors in paddy soils. OXC, a
   non-equilibrium capacity-type redox parameter, clearly identified
   geochemical redox classes of oxic, post-oxic, sulfidic and methanic
   conditions in the paddy pore waters during the course of the
   rice-growing season. Based on data observed for 3 years, it is concluded
   that straw incorporation does enhance more reducing conditions
   development compared to that without straw incorporation. We conclude
   that OXC provides a better characterization of redox status in paddy
   soils. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil acidification and accelerated mineral weathering as a result of N
   fertilization may result in a soil solution silica Activity that favors
   the formation of short-range-order aluminosilicates, thereby
   sequestering Al. Furthermore, soils formed in alluviums of differing
   lithology may partition Al-3(+) into different pools. We hypothesized
   that parent material silica content controls solution silica
   concentrations and short-range-order aluminosilicate formation, thereby
   controlling solution Al3+ activity. As a result, we expected mineralogy
   to follow alteration pathways toward the minerals found in weathered
   naturally acidic (acidic) soils. To test this hypothesis, we compared
   the mineral assemblages in nonacidified (NA), agriculturally acidified
   (AA) and acidic soils formed in sialic, mafic, and mixed alluvium. X-ray
   diffraction analysis revealed that the clay fraction bulk mineralogy of
   AA soils is similar to their NA counterparts, but in every case, clay
   activity, as measured by CEC/clay, was reduced by the acidification
   process, a trend consistent with mineral alteration trajectories toward
   the acidic, weathered soils. A combination of selective dissolution and
   CEC measurements suggested that precipitation of short-range-order
   hydroxy-Al and aluminosilicates were the dominant mechanisms that
   control solution Al. In the AA soil derived from sialic parent material,
   hydroxy-Al was the largest Al pool. In the agriculturally acidified soil
   derived from mafic parent materials, the short-range-order
   aluminosilicate fraction was the dominant Al pool. Aluminum sinks in AA
   soils with mixed lithology were dominated by hydroxy-Al and exchangeable
   Al. We speculate that ``free{''} (noninterlayer) hydroxy-Al may be a
   significant Al sink in the AA soils. Our results suggest that
   short-range-order aluminosilicates play some role in controlling soil
   solution Al activity, but the higher silica content of the parent
   material did not correlate directly with increased abundance of
   short-range-order alurninosilicate compounds in acidified soils. This
   research on soil acidification provides new information on how ammonium
   fertilization affects the chemical aspects of soil quality, in
   particular, the partitioning of Al to solid phases that may not be in
   equilibrium with the bulk clay mineralogy. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{One measure of forest soil quality is the ability of the soil to support
   tree growth. In mediterranean-type ecosystems, such as most of
   California's forests, there is virtually no rainfall during the summer
   growing season, so trees must rely on water stored within the substrate.
   Water is the primary limitation to productivity in these forests. Many
   forest soils in California are relatively thin, but are underlain by
   thick zones of weathered bedrock. Weathered granitic bedrock, the most
   prevalent lithology, has available water capacities (0.12-cm water/cm
   rock) that approach those of soils (0.2-cm water/cm soil) and, because
   the weathered rock zone is usually so much thicker (several meters) than
   the soil (< 1 m), it almost always constitutes the larger storage
   reservoir for plant-available water. The weathered bedrock retains the
   original rock fabric and is friable and easily excavated, but the
   primary minerals are not thoroughly altered to clay minerals, so it is
   not considered saprolite. Roots of ponderosa pine (Pinusponderosa)
   seedlings penetrate through the soil and encounter weathered bedrock
   within the first 2 years on many sites. Thus, the influence of the
   weathered bedrock zone on plant growth begins early. Root access to the
   weathered bedrock is restricted to fractures, which are often spaced
   about 50 cm apart. Water is extracted from the intervening rock matrix
   through unsaturated flow toward the root mat in the fractures and by
   mycorrhizal fungal hyphae that penetrate the rock matrix. At one site in
   the Sierra Nevada, 30-year-old Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi) depleted the
   soil-held water by mid-June and relied on water stored in the weathered
   bedrock until the rainy season began in October. In this case, the
   weathered bedrock supplied at least 70\% of the water used by the trees
   during the growing season. In the same area, we found that thin soils
   are not a detriment to pine productivity when they are underlain by a
   thick zone of weathered bedrock. In mediterranean-type ecosystems, the
   weathered bedrock zone is an essential component of the plant water
   supply system and is thus an important contributor to forest soil
   quality. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the role that land quality and imperfect markets
   play in generating the inverse productivity relationship in the
   International Crop Research Institute for the Semi Arid Tropics
   (ICRISAT) data. Differences in land quality largely explain the
   ``Inverse Productivity{''} (IP) relationship in the random effects
   profit regression, but not in labor demand regressions. Controlling for
   labor and land market failures and differences in soil quality
   eliminates the IP relationship for male labor, but not female labor in
   the random effects estimates. The inverse relationship is much stronger
   in fixed effects than random effects estimates, suggesting that the farm
   size variable may be subject to measurement error, a view supported by
   the results of instrumental variables estimation. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The results from 14 field trials comparing the long-term ( 20 to 120
   years) effects of fertilisers and manures ( farmyard manure, slurry, and
   green manure) on crop production and soil properties are reviewed. In
   total there were 24 paired comparisons of the effects of manure and
   fertiliser. Some of the trials also contained a control ( no nutrient
   inputs) treatment. The input of nutrients as either fertilisers or
   manures had very large effects (150-1000\%) on soil productivity as
   measured by crop yields. Manured soils had higher contents of organic
   matter and numbers of microfauna than fertilised soils, and were more
   enriched in P, K, Ca and Mg in topsoils and nitrate N, Ca and Mg in
   subsoils. Manured soils also had lower bulk density and higher porosity,
   hydraulic conductivity and aggregate stability, relative to fertilised
   soils. However, there was no significant difference (P < 0.05) between
   fertilisers and manures in their long-term effects on crop production.
   In the context of this set of international trials, the recent evidence
   from the Rothamsted classical long-term trials appears to be
   exceptional, due to the larger inputs of manures and larger accumulation
   of soil OM in these trials. It is suggested therefore that manures may
   only have a benefit on soil productivity, over and above their nutrient
   content, when large inputs are applied over many years. The evidence
   from these trials also shows that, because the ratio of nutrients in
   manures is different from the ratio of nutrients removed by common
   crops, excessive accumulation of some nutrients, and particularly P and
   N, can arise from the long-term use of manures, relative to the use of
   fertilisers. Under these conditions greater runoff of P, and leaching of
   N may result, and for soils with low P retention and/or in situations
   where organic P is leached, greater P leaching losses may occur. The use
   of manures, relative to fertilisers, may also contribute to poor water
   quality by increasing its chemical oxygen demand. It is concluded
   therefore that it cannot generally be assumed that the long-term use of
   manures will enhance soil quality - defined in terms of productivity and
   potential to adversely affect water quality - in the long term, relative
   to applying the same amounts of nutrients as fertiliser.}},

Abstract = {{A no-tillage (NT) system was developed in semiarid Morocco to improve
   the soil fertility and stabilize yield through conservation of water.
   Results in two long-term trials (4 and 11 years) were able to show the
   effects of a no-tillage system in increasing total soil organic matter
   and total nitrogen. Over time, the quality of the NT soil surface was
   improved compared with that under conventional tillage (CT) with disc
   harrows. This effect was the result of an increase in soil organic
   carbon (SOC) and a slight decline in pH. However, over time, nitrogen
   decreased in both tillage practices, especially in the 0-25 mm layer
   (from 0.59 to 0.57 t ha(-1) and from 0.44 to 0.42 t ha(-1) under NT and
   CT, respectively). After 4 years of NT an extra 5.62 t ha(-1) of SOC was
   sequestered in the 0-25 mm layer, and after 11 years the SOC increased
   further to 7.21 t ha(-1).}},

Abstract = {{The Nagaon Pulp and Paper Mill (Assam, India) produces 100,000 tonnes of
   paper annually from bamboo. The mill is surrounded by a vast spread of
   agricultural land on all sides excepting the southern side, which is
   covered with hills and deep forests. The present study was undertaken
   with a view to assess the impact of the paper mill operations on the
   quality of the surrounding soil. Surface soil samples (0-15 cm depth)
   were collected in both dry and wet seasons over a four-year period from
   19 points at different distances from the mill. The soil quality was
   determined with respect to a large number of representative
   physico-chemical properties. Estimation of the major oxides, e. g.,
   SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, MnO, and TiO2 showed a preferential accumulation of
   Al2O3, Fe2O3, and MnO in soil near the mill due to the dumping of fly
   ash and other solid wastes in the surrounding low lying land. Definite
   directional trends were observed not only with respect to these oxides,
   but also with the metals Ca, Mg, Na, and Pb, which decreased away from
   the mill. The soil pH had a tendency to turn alkaline near the mill
   owing to the discharge of highly alkaline effluent by the mill. The
   physical characteristics of the soil, viz., water holding capacity and
   bulk density increased with distance from the mill while the hydraulic
   conductivity had an opposite trend. N, P, K, B, Cl-, and organic C
   contents of the soil had shown a rapid decreasing trend away from the
   mill indicating that the dumping of solid waste and discharge of
   nutrient-rich treated effluent had contributed to raised levels of these
   constituents near the mill.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of Parthenium hysterophorus , native to the tropical
   Americas and invasive to several countries, was evaluated for response
   to soil quality. Phenological (six stages) and quantitative growth
   variables {[}relative growth rates in height (R-h) and diameter (R-d)]
   were measured every fortnight. Based on harvest data, the variables,
   root:shoot (R:S) ratio, specific leaf area (SLA), relative growth rate
   in biomass (R-w), net assimilation rate (NAR) and dry matter allocation
   to plant components, were determined. High clay content in soils
   prolonged the rosette stage, enhanced R-h and R-d and hampered root
   growth, but promoted biomass allocation to shoots. The extreme degree of
   plant mortality was observed, with only 33.3\% individuals surviving to
   reproduce in the soils with highest clay contents. This appears to be
   one of the most important findings that certainly has a major bearing on
   the range of adaptation of the weed. Seed mass declined whereas seed
   production increased in relatively coarser soils with the exception of
   nearly pure sand. In soils rich in clay, plants produced a smaller
   number of larger seeds. These data suggest that variation in fundamental
   functional traits would enable P. hysterophorus to adjust to a variety
   of habitat conditions.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] Loess deposits are widespread, covering about 10 percent of the
   Earth's land surface. Magnetic susceptibility (MS), an important
   parameter in loess deposits, is a function of the concentration of
   magnetic minerals, which exhibit diagnostic features in their visible
   and near-infrared (NIR) spectra. Therefore, MS should correlate with
   spectral reflectance. To determine if a relationship exists between MS
   and reflectance spectra we analyzed NIR spectra and MS of over 550
   samples from seven loess-paleosol sequences on Loess Plateau of Central
   China. NIR reflectance data were first converted into eight spectral
   bands and then a step-wise multiple linear regression was applied to a
   calibration dataset to establish a model to predict MS values. Test
   datasets indicate our model is very successful, all produced an r(2) >
   0.9. By applying this new method for estimating MS to hyperspectral
   remote sensing data we anticipate mapping soil quality and MS on the
   Loess Plateau.}},

Abstract = {{The Serra de Rodes catchment (NE Spain), enclosed in the Natural Park of
   Cap de Creus, represents a typical Mediterranean ecosystem. This
   semiarid environment, with hot summers and mild winters, has been
   progressively abandoned by farmers during the last century. Nowadays,
   most of hillside soils are abandoned and only small patches of vineyards
   and olive trees are cultivated with very low management and incomes. In
   this study, we have assessed the effects of land use and land use change
   on the main soil quality parameters. Along two altitudinal gradients, we
   selected 11 random environments representative of the current land uses,
   in sequence from cultivated to early abandonment. The different
   vegetation stages were grouped in four main land use types according to
   the age of abandonment: cultivated fields (vineyard and olive trees, 0
   years), recent abandonment (dense and cleared shrubs, 5 years),
   mid-abandonment (cleared cork trees and dense olive trees, 25 years) and
   early abandonment (dense cork trees and pine trees reforestation, 50
   years). Erosion plots were installed in the previously selected
   environments for soil physicochemical characterisation, throughout
   1-year observation, monitoring nutrient losses, runoff volume and
   sediment yield data. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates significant
   differences in the main soil quality parameters such as soil organic
   matter (SOM), total nitrogen (N), water holding capacity (VMC) and pH,
   among the selected environments under different land use conditions.
   Factor analysis of the principal components (PCA) enabled the
   identification of three soil quality indices: index of soil erosion and
   nutrient losses (SENL), index of soil quality and fertility (SQF) and
   index of vegetation cover and soil protection (VCP). Soil organic
   matter, nutrient supply, soil vegetation cover and soil compaction. are
   critical for soil degradation in these environments and they must be
   managed appropriately in order to ensure continuous soil rehabilitation.
   Furthermore, the main conclusion that may be drawn from this study is
   the significant influence of land use on the main soil quality
   parameters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, farmers claim that management practices can significantly
   influence soil quality. For instance, it is common practice for dairy
   farms in their rotation cycle to harvest grain and then leave stubble
   and weeds over winter on the soil surface before ploughing in spring
   ahead of planting crops. Corn stubble and weeds protect soil in winter,
   decompose through the seasons, and release nutrients that are utilized
   by crops and microorganisms. Also, plant residues may harbor increased
   soil decomposing organisms that feed up on them. Both conventional and
   organic farmers tend to follow these practices with the major difference
   that in the conventional systems, inorganic fertilizers and pesticides
   are applied. Organic matter breakdown in soils under different
   management (organic versus conventional as in this case) may be
   different because some inorganic chemicals are known to affect soil
   decomposers and also these might be less abundant in soils with less
   food resources, since the organic farmers rely totally on soil fertility
   derived from organic source. This hypothesis was tested in an on-farm
   decomposition study conducted in an organic and a conventional farm that
   grew corn (Zea mays L.) for dairy cattle feed, in Wayne County, OH. Mesh
   bags containing crop and weed residues were laid on the soil surface at
   the onset of winter and sampled thereafter to determine decomposition.
   Mass loss was significantly different among substrates, with crop
   residues decomposing faster than weeds. Mass and nitrogen (N) loss
   varied among substrates and variations were greater in summer. Between
   farms mass and N loss were significantly higher in the organic farm in
   summer. Earthworm population density was significantly higher in the
   organic farm; In summary, corn residues decomposed faster than weed
   residues, and differences in decomposition among substrates increased in
   summer. Decomposition was faster in summer at both farms, however, it
   was higher at the organic one, where more soil decomposers were found.
   The higher metabolic activity in the soil of the organic farm in warmer
   weather suggests a more active soil biota, which may be crucial for
   farms whose main or sole source of nutrients derives from organic matter
   decomposition. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic C (SOC) directly affects soil quality by influencing
   aeration and water retention and serving as a major repository and
   reserve source of plant nutrients. Limited information is available
   concerning the long-term SOC changes in turfgrass systems. The CENTURY
   simulation model offers an opportunity to predict long-term SOC trends
   based on mathematical representations of C-cycling processes in the
   soil-plant systems. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate
   the ability and effectiveness of the CENTURY model to simulate the
   long-term SOC dynamics in highly managed turfgrass ecosystems and (ii)
   simulate long-term SOC changes for golf course fairway and putting green
   scenarios with the CENTURY model. The CENTURY model simulations near
   Denver and Fort Collins, CO, indicate that turfgrass systems can serve
   as a C sink following establishment. Model estimates are that 23 to 32
   Mg ha(-1) SOC were sequestered in the 0 to 20 cm below the soil surface
   after about 30 yr. Historic soil-testing data from parts of 16 golf
   courses with age ranging from 1 to 45 yr were used to compare with the
   simulated results. Model predictions of organic C accumulation compared
   reasonably well with observed SOC, with regression coefficients of 0.67
   for fairways and 0.83 for putting greens. Our results suggest that the
   CENTURY model can be used to simulate SOC changes in turfgrass systems
   and has the potential to compare C sequestration under various turf
   management conditions. Simulation results also suggest that warming
   temperatures have greater degree of influence on SOC in turf systems
   compared with native grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Cover crops and N fertilization rates may influence soil aggregation and

   productivity. We compared the effects of legume {[}hairy vetch (Vicia
   villosa Roth) and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.)] and
   nonlegume {[}rye (Secale cereale L.)] cover crops and N fertilization
   rates \{half N rate {[}HN: 90 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for 3 yr of tomato
   (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) followed by 80 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for
   eggplant (Solanum melogena L.)]\} and full N rate {[}FN: 180 kg N ha(-1)
   yr(-1) for 3 yr of tomato followed by 160 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for
   eggplant]\} on soil aggregation and C and N pools in whole-soil and
   aggregates. The pools were organic C, total N, potential C
   mineralization and potential N mineralization (PCM and PNM), microbial
   biomass C and microbial biomass N (MBC and MBN), and particulate organic
   C and particulate organic N (POC and PON). Field experiment was
   conducted in a Greenville fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, kaolinitic,
   thermic, Rhodic Kandiudults) from 1995 to 2000 in Fort Valley, Georgia,
   USA. While the amount of soil present in aggregates decreased with
   decreasing size class, the amount was greater with nonlegume and FN than
   with HN and legume cover crops in the 2.00- to 0.85-mm size class.
   Organic C, PCM, and MBC contents in whole-soil were greater with
   nonlegume, but MBN and PON were greater with legumes than in the control
   with no cover crop or N fertilization. Organic C and total N
   concentrations in aggregates were greater in 2.00- to 0.50-mm than in
   4.75- to 2.00-mm, <0.25-mm, or <4.75-mm (whole-soil) size classes, but
   PNM and MBN were greater in <0.50- or <4.75-mm than in 4.75- to 2.00-mm
   size classes. As POC and PON decreased with decreasing aggregate-size
   class, POC in the <0.85-mm size class was greater with nonlegume and PON
   in the 2.00- to 0.85-mm size classes was greater with legumes than with
   the control and N rates. Nonlegume may increase soil aggregation,
   microbial activities, and C sequestration, but legumes may increase N
   mineralization in the soil compared with no cover crop. Nitrogen
   fertilization also may improve soil aggregation. Nitrogen mineralization
   and C and N sequestration may be greater in aggregates <2.00 mm
   diameter. Cover crops and N fertilization may improve soil quality and
   productivity, particularly in intermediate and small size (<2.00 mm)
   aggregates.}},

Abstract = {{Development of remediative techniques for PAH-contaminated soils and
   evaluation of residual toxicity after remediation are important issues
   in the assessment of soil quality. To investigate the efficiency of soil
   remediation technology using biomonitoring assay, soil flushing
   experiments with surfactant and ecotoxicity tests with Eisenia fetida
   were carried out for artificially phenanthrene-contaminated soils.
   Mortality and growth of the earthworms were significantly influenced by
   phenanthrene concentration and exposure time to the contaminant.
   Sublethal toxicity effects such as weight variation of the organisms
   appeared to be more reliable factors than acute effects (e.g.,
   mortality) to represent soil toxicity when compared with chemical
   determination of remaining phenanthrene. The contaminated soils
   remediated with more than 15 pore volumes of the surfactant were not
   significantly toxic to the earthworms with respect to average weight
   development, which was clearly confirmed by the results of chemical
   assessment for remaining phenanthrene in the soils. According to this,
   optimum amount of surfactant solution for effective remediation was
   estimated as 15 pore volumes. These results showed that the improvement
   of PAH remediation technology can be complemented by employing
   ecotoxicological assessment of remediated soils.}},

Abstract = {{Because of long-term chemical processes, metal bioavailability in field
   soils decreases with time. Metal toxicity may, therefore, be
   overestimated if toxicity data with freshly spiked soils are used to
   derive soil quality criteria, a current practice. In the present study,
   effects of the long-term processes, called aging, on copper partitioning
   and ecotoxicity are investigated. Twenty-five field soils contaminated
   by copper runoff from bronze statues and 25 uncontaminated control soils
   sampled at 5-m distance from these statues were collected in Flanders
   (Belgium). The soils were selected so that parameters affecting copper
   bioavailability (pH, cation-exchange capacity, organic matter content,
   etc.) varied considerably. To assess the effect of aging on copper
   toxicity, control soils were spiked at total copper concentrations
   comparable to those of historically contaminated soils. Pore-water
   copper concentrations and 0.01 M CaCl2-extracted copper concentrations
   were significantly higher in freshly spiked soils compared to
   contaminated field soils. However, this could be a pH effect, because pH
   decreased after spiking. Acute toxicity to Enchytraeus albidus (14 d) as
   well as chronic toxicity to Folsomia candida (28-d reproduction) and
   Trifolium pratense (14-d growth) indicated a dose-response relationship
   between copper toxicity and pore-water copper concentration or the
   CaCl2-extracted copper fraction.}},

Abstract = {{Transformation of organic amendments in soil greatly affects its
   physical, chemical, and biological properties. The aim of this study was
   to investigate changes of soil quality attributes in field plots after
   3-5 years of annual paddy-upland crop rotation with various
   fertilizations since 1995. Other than the amendments of green manure,
   compost, and peat, chemical fertilizer N in the amounts of 33\% and 67\%
   of established N rate were complemented. Spring rice (Oryza sativa L.)
   and autumn maize (Zea mays L.) were planted each year. After the
   harvests of three to five maize and rice crops from 1998 through 2000,
   surface soil samples were collected from the plots of each treatment.
   Applications of organic materials to the plots prevented soil pH from
   decreasing, and increased the amounts of soluble salts. After rice
   harvest, the soil water contents at 0.033 MPa tension were significantly
   greater in soils amended with peat and/or compost than that with
   chemical fertilizer and the check. The bulk density of surface soils of
   the field plots amended with organic materials was significantly lower
   than that of the check. After maize harvest, the differences in bulk
   density of the surface soils among the seven treatments were not
   significant. The percentages of water stable aggregate in 1-2 and 0.5-1
   mm. particle size fractions of the soils, amended with peat and compost,
   were significantly higher than those amended with chemical fertilizer
   and the check. Although chemical fertilizer played a significant role in
   governing the maize and rice yields, it did not significantly contribute
   to the improvement of some soil quality attributes. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Soil organic C is often suggested as an indicator of soil quality, but
   desirable targets are rarely specified. We tested three approaches to
   define maximum and lowest desirable soil C contents for four New Zealand
   soil orders. Approach I used the New Zealand National Soils Database
   (NSD). The maximum C content was defined as the median value of
   long-term pastures, and the lower quartile defined the lowest desirable
   soil C content. Approach 2 used the CENTURY model to predict maximum C
   contents of long-term pasture. Lowest desirable content was defined by
   the level that still allowed recovery to 80\% of the maximum C content
   over 25 yr. Approach 3 used an expert panel to define desirable C
   contents based on production and environmental criteria. Median C
   contents (0-20 cm) for the Recent, Granular, Melanic, and Allophanic
   orders were 72,88,98,132 Mg ha(-1), and similar to contents predicted by
   the CENTURY model (78, 93, 102, and 134 Mg ha(-1), respectively). Lower
   quartile values (54, 78, 73, and 103 Mg ha(-1), respectively) were
   similar to the lowest desirable C contents calculated by CENTURY
   (55,54,67, and 104 Mg ha(-1), respectively). Expert opinion was that C
   contents could be depleted below these values with tolerable effects on
   production but less so for the environment. The CENTURY model is our
   preferred approach for setting soil organic C targets, but the model
   needs calibrating for other soils and land uses. The statistical and
   expert opinion approaches are less defensible in setting lower limits
   for desirable C contents.}},

Abstract = {{A confirmatory structural equation model was built in order to test the
   generality of Grace and Pugesek's model of species richness. A main
   feature of their model was that light reaching the soil surface had the
   strongest effects on species richness, and that disturbance and biomass
   effects were largely indirect via effects on light. Their model was not
   confirmed for the understory vegetation of floodplain oak savannas and a
   new model had numerous fundamental differences. Disturbance history had
   the strongest direct effects on richness and these were independent of
   biomass effects. Richness was maximal at intermediate disturbance and
   biomass. Bivariate relationships between soil quality and species
   density were very weak because soil quality simultaneously had negative
   direct effects and positive indirect effects (through biomass), such
   that the total effect of soil was negligible. This provides an example
   of how structural modeling can provide insights that are not possible
   with other numerical methods. The complex effects of soils support
   recent findings that some soil components tend to increase richness via
   a species pool effect while other components tend to reduce richness via
   biotic interactions. The effects of light were not significant, but
   canopy trees had weak, positive effects, and this contradicts other
   structural models which have generally shown that shading reduces
   species richness. Here, species richness increases with shade presumably
   because of species pool effects, whereby the species pool increases by
   including prairie, savanna, and some woodland species and indirectly by
   reducing dominance by warm-season grasses. The results have implications
   for management because of the overall importance of disturbance history,
   however the majority of the variation in richness was left unexplained
   and this suggests other factors such as dispersal limitation, soil
   fungi, and historical effects may be of overriding importance in these
   oak savannas.}},

Abstract = {{Human activity and urbanization result in urban-rural environmental
   gradients. Understanding effect of the gradients on soil properties is
   necessary for management of the soils around urban areas. In this study,
   soil quality of some vegetable fields was characterized along an
   urban-rural gradient in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province. Fifteen soil
   physical and chemical properties were evaluated by using principal
   component analysis. Results showed that there was a great variation in
   the soil quality along the gradient. From rural to urban zones, soil
   organic matter, water-stable aggregates, cation exchangeable capacity
   (CEC), total N and P, and available K increased, whereas soil pH value
   decreased. In addition, Pb, Cu, Ni, Co, Zn and Cr in the soils tended to
   be accumulated toward the urban zone. Sequential chemical extraction
   showed that mobility of all the heavy metals in the soils tended to
   increase from the rural to the urban zones. The variation of soil
   properties accounted for by the first principal component was
   significantly explained by the difference in application rates of
   municipal wastes.}},

Abstract = {{Soil management affects the soil physical quality, but the magnitude of
   the changes is dependent of use time and regional edaphoclimatic
   conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term
   (21 yr) effect of conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems
   on some physical properties in the 0.2 m top layer of an Oxisol from
   Parana, southern Brazil. In comparison with an adjacent forest soil used
   as reference, the use of CT system increased the soil bulk density,
   penetrometer resistance and soil temperature; and decreased the mean
   geometric diameter of soil aggregates The main changes in soil
   attributes by using NT in comparison with CT were: decrease in soil bulk
   density in subsurface layer (0.1 - 0.2 m) from 1.08 to 0.99 Mg m(-3);
   decrease in maximum soil temperature in the 0-0.05 m layer from 27.9 to
   24.7 degreesC, increase in mean geometric diameter of soil aggregates
   from 1.6 to 3.7 mm at 0-0.05 m layer, and increase in volumetric soil
   water content in the 0-0.1 m layer from 0.38 to 0.48 m(3) m(-3).
   However, there were no differences between effects of tillage systems on
   soil porosity (total, macro and microporosity), saturated hydraulic
   conductivity, penetrometer resistance, and clay flocculation degree. The
   amelioration of physical properties in no-tilled soil may be related to
   increases of 42\% in soybean and 22\% in corn yields in this
   conservation tillage system, in comparison with CT system.}},

Abstract = {{The less oxidative environment in soils of no-tillage systems decreases
   the humification degree of organic matter. To test this hypothesis, the
   concentration of semiquinone free radicals (SFR) of organic matter from
   the surface layer (0 to 25 mm) of a Humic Cambisol (Lages, Santa
   Catarina State) was evaluated. The soil had been cultivated for 8 yrs
   under conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no-tillage
   (NT). The SFR concentration in organic matter was assessed by electron
   spin resonance (ESR) in the granulometric fractions (> 53,53-20,20-2,
   and < 2 mum). Among the tillage systems, the lowest concentration of SFR
   in the whole soil organic matter was observed in no-tilled soil (15.83 x
   10(17) `spins' g(-1) C), in comparison with CT (18.33 x 10(17) `spins'
   g(-1) C) and RT (18.39 x 10(17) `spins' g(-1) C). Organic matter of the
   20-2 Am size fraction showed a higher concentration of SFR and a smaller
   line width, which is consistent with a higher humification degree and/or
   higher interaction with soil minerals, in comparison with the size
   fractions > 53 and < 2 mum. The ESR signal of SFR was not detected in
   the 53-20 mum granulometric fraction due to the low organic C contents.
   In addition to the effect on soil C and N stocks, no-tillage decreases
   the humification degree of organic matter which may have an important
   influence on the soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Alfisols are the predominant soil resource in Ohio. An understanding of
   the relationships among their soil and site variables will help in
   planning judicious future land use to maintain soil quality and sustain
   agriculture. The objective of this study was to identify associations
   and their significance between dependent variables of surface horizons
   of Alfisols (consisting of bulk density, base saturation, CEC, pH,
   Munsell value and chroma) and descriptive variables (including drainage
   class, elevation, sand, slope gradient, soil organic carbon) using
   canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The association of SOC
   concentration with bulk density was found to be the most important
   relationship among the selected variables, followed by the association
   of soil clay content with CEC. The association of drainage class and
   Munsell chroma was identified as being dominant and significant from the
   third pair of canonical variates. Despite pronounced variations in the
   means of all selected variables among land uses, these associations and
   their significance were consistently confirmed, regardless of land use,
   and were responsible for about 60\% of the variance within each set of
   variables. Additional associations could be identified from other
   canonical variates but were less explicit and varied widely among land
   uses. As a means of identifying associations and the order of their
   importance among multivariates, the CCA has become a promising technique
   for simplifying, and simultaneously analyzing, two sets of complex data
   consisting of biotic and abiotic variables.}},

Abstract = {{Despite extensive research, reduced corn (Zea mays L.) performance is
   still encountered using conservation tillage on fine-textured soils in
   cool humid temperate climates. These problems are intensified when corn
   is planted into residue from a previous crop such as winter wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.). The objective of this 4-yr study was to
   determine the influence of fall zone tillage (ZT), no tillage (NT), and
   conventional moldboard plow tillage (CT) (fall plowing) on corn
   performance and soil physical quality under a winter wheat-corn-soybean
   (Glycine max L. Merr.) rotation with and without red clover (Trifolium
   pratense L.) (RC) underseeded in the wheat phase of the rotation. A
   randomized complete block design (3x2 factorial, 4 replicates) was
   established on three adjacent fields in the fall of 1996 on a Brookston
   clay loam soil (fine loamy, mixed, mesic, Typic Argiaquoll) at Woodslee,
   ON Canada, and measurements were collected during 1997 to 2000. Over
   both wet and dry growing seasons from 1998-2000, zone tillage following
   underseeded RC produced average corn grain yields (7.23 Mg ha(-1)) that
   were within 1\% of those obtained using conventional tillage (7.33 Mg
   ha(-1)), and 36\% higher than those obtained using no tillage and RC
   (5.33 Mg ha(-1)). Zone tillage also improved soil quality as evidenced
   by generally lower soil strength than no tillage, and near-surface soil
   physical quality parameters that were equivalent to, or more favorable
   than, those of the other treatments. It was concluded that corn
   production using zone tillage and RC underseeding is a viable option in
   Brookston clay loam soil, as it retains much of the soil quality benefit
   of conventional tillage but still achieves most of the yield benefit of
   conventional moldboard plow tillage.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine how no-till and
   conventional tillage affected microbial properties of soil quality,
   using permanent grass fields as a standard of local high-quality soils.
   Agricultural fields in South Dakota were matched within soil type and
   location so that each set contained one field managed in permanent grass
   cover, one managed for annual crops using conventional tillage, and one
   managed for annual crops using no-till. Microbial biomass and
   activities, particularly those related to nitrogen and phosphorus
   availability were examined in 0-15 cm soil samples. Most measures of
   microbial activity were similar in the two annually cropped management
   systems but less than under permanent grass. Soils managed under
   permanent grass contained approximately 160\% greater labile carbon and
   50\% greater microbial biomass, and supported approximately 150\%
   greater dehydrogenase enzyme activity, 50\% greater respiration, and
   180\% greater acid phosphatase activity, than no-till and conventionally
   tilled soils, which were similar in these measures. Grassed soils also
   mineralized 460\% greater N under anaerobic conditions and 80\% greater
   N under aerobic conditions, while potential nitrification was 25\%
   greater on average than cropped soils. Mycorrhizal fungi colonized 76\%
   of observed root segments under grass, 63\% under no-till, and 55\%
   under conventional tillage. Among the suite of tests in this study, only
   alkaline phosphatase activity and C mineralized in 12 days were
   significantly different under no-till and conventional tillage, both
   greater under no-till. Crops grown in a no-till system may be expected
   to resist low available P as well as other stresses better than crops in
   conventionally tilled soils due to greater activity of alkaline
   phosphatase and marginally increased mycorrhizal colonization of roots.
   No-till management in central South Dakota has allowed enhancement of
   readily mineralizable C and alkaline phosphatase activity. (C) 2002

Title = {{Productivity in maize based cropping systems under various
   soil-water-nutrient management strategies in a semi-arid, alfisol
   environment in East Africa}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{A 3-year field experiment was undertaken at two sites in semi-arid
   Tanzania with the objective of analysing the potential for improving the
   productivity of maize based cropping systems through combinations of
   water conservation and nutrient management. The soils at the two sites
   differed mainly in their degree of weathering, clay content of the
   argillic horizon and the overall soil fertility level. The rainfall
   regime during the experimental period included years with drought,
   normal rainfall, and a very wet year.
   Tied-ridging enhanced the response to rainfall and fertilizer, the soil
   supply of plant available N, the positive effect of inter-cropping on
   total grain yield, and the harvest index. The combined response to
   annual rainfall and, N and P fertilizer under tied-ridged conditions
   could be summarised as simple empirical functions accounting for 98\% of
   the variance in yields. Considerable yield increases above ``farmers'
   practices{''} (i.e. flat cultivation and no fertilizer) could be
   realised by combining tied-ridged tillage with inputs of mineral N and P
   fertilizer, reaching maize grain yield levels of six times the
   prevailing yield under farmers' practices of approximate 1 Mg ha(-1).
   Similarly, the rainfall-grain productivity could be tripled reaching
   levels of 6 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) at high fertilizer inputs in years of
   near-normal rainfall. The effect of tied-ridging was both positive and
   negative, with the positive effect dominating at near-normal rainfall
   (500-600 mm) whereas the negative effect dominated at annual rainfalls
   above 700-900 mm. However, the negative effect could be partly mitigated
   through fertilizer inputs. The site with the more weathered soil
   displayed a higher sensitivity to moisture deficits and excesses and a
   narrower rainfall range with positive effect of ridging. Under
   near-normal to slightly dry rainfall conditions, tied-ridging without
   nutrient inputs resulted on an average in 34 and 42\% grain yield
   increase at the two sites.
   A benefit-cost analysis supports tied-ridging as a potentially
   profitable technology, especially at the site with better soil quality,
   slightly higher rainfall and market integration. Thus, a subsistence
   oriented household will maximise profitability of a maize-cowpea
   inter-cropping system by using tied-ridging and no fertilizer input
   whereas a market oriented more resourceful household will maximise
   profitability from a combination of tied-ridging and high fertilizer
   inputs. The scarcity of cattle manure and the total cost of application
   are prohibitive to cattle manure becoming a viable and significant
   option of nutrient inputs for most farmers in the area. Inter-cropping
   with cowpea is an important economic factor, currently constrained by
   diseases and low crop densities.
   The study highlights the importance of analysing soil and water
   conservation technologies within a farming systems perspective, and
   supports a focus on soil and water conservation practices such as
   tied-ridging in a semi-arid environment with annual rainfall of 500-700
   mm. However, recognising potential drawbacks of the tied-ridged
   technology, it is proposed also to investigate alternative practices
   improving in situ moisture conservation at minimum soil disturbance. (C)

Abstract = {{Grazing livestock create localized nutrient patches that increase soil
   ionic strength (IS) and influence plant productivity. The ability of
   plant root systems to control ion absorption and flux to xylem, and to
   sequester ions reaching leaf tissue in bound, nontoxic forms are means
   of minimizing IS. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine the
   growth and mineral acquisition responses of forage chicory (Cichorium
   intybus L. cv. Grasslands Puna) to increasing (0.9, 4, 8, and 12 dS
   m(-1)) IS in the rhizosphere obtained by additions of NaCl/CaCl2 (1 : 1
   m ratio). Plants were harvested four times after planting (20, 27, 34
   and 41 d) to identify responses as a function of time. Increased
   accumulation and localization of Na in roots in comparison to shoots
   suggested that chicory restricted Na transport to shoots, and that
   insoluble Na in tissues increased with increasing IS. Soluble cations in
   shoots were about 50 \% of total cations, irrespective of rhizosphere IS
   and Na uptake. Differences in the cation:anion ratio could not be
   accounted for by organic acid concentrations in chicory, but substantial
   accumulation of nonstructural carbohydrates as fructans in roots could
   contribute to charge balance. Our results demonstrate that forage
   chicory has moderate tolerance to IS, suggesting that it might be a
   useful species for sites with potential for IS. Chicory growth would
   probably be sustained under IS conditions, and the resultant vigorous
   growth and accumulation of mineral nutrients in shoots would contribute
   to acceptable nutritive value for grazing livestock. Plants capable of
   growing in and acquiring nutrients from nutrient-laden patches in the
   sward would help minimize erosion and nutrient transport, with positive
   benefits for water and soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{In a three years field study (1996-1999) the performance of four
   different composts obtained from legume straw (Glycine max Merr.L),
   cereal straw (Triticum aestivum), oilseed straw (Brassica juncea L.) and
   city garbage were compared among them and also with chemical fertilizers
   in terms of degree of maturity, quality of compost, improvement in soil
   organic matter, biological activity of soil and yields of soybean and
   wheat. Phospho-sulfo-nitrocomposts were prepared containing
   approximately 3.2 to 4.2\% P and 1.5 to 2.3 \% N, in an aerobic process
   of decomposition for 4 months by adding the aqueous slurry of 1:1 (dry
   weight) cow dung, 5\% P2O5 in the form of low grade Mussorie phosphate
   rock (17.2\% P2O5), 10\% Pyrite (S, 22.2\%) and 0.5\% urea N,
   bioinoculum such as cellulose decomposer (Paecilomyces fusisporus and
   Aspergillus awamori), P-solubilizing organisms viz, Bacillus polymyxa
   and Pseudomonas striata. The maturity parameters were strongly
   associated with the source of materials, chemical composition and degree
   of decomposition. The matured composts had lower C/N ratios (8.2 to
   21.7) and water soluble carbohydrates (0.23 to 0.43 \%), and larger
   ratios of CEC/TOC and Lignin/cellulose ratios than the initial. The
   quality composts improved the substantial quantity of total P, water
   soluble P, citrate soluble P, total N and NO3-N and the application of
   phosphocompost at 5 Mg ha(-1) gave plant growth, dry matter
   accumulation, seed yield, and N and P uptake by soybean equivalent to 25
   kg N and 60 kg P2O5 ha(-1). Continuous turnover of enriched
   phosphocompost improved substantial quantity of soil microbial biomass
   C, activity of enzymes compared to application of chemical fertilizer
   and sustained soil quality in terms of chemical and biological health.}},

Abstract = {{The bacterial compositions of seven hot-pepper sown soil were compared

   bacteria in the high productivity and monoculture soil samples. While
   Arthrobacter (17\%), Kocuria (11\%), Pseudomonas (8\%), and Bacillus
   (8\%) were predominant among bacteria which were cultured on
   heterotrophic (YG) agar medium, Pseudomonas (56\%), Stenotrophomonas
   (16\%), and Burkholderia (8\%) were predominant on crystal violet agar
   medium. Shannon-Weaver indices (H) indicated that colonies obtained from
   heterotrophic agar medium (3.1) were found to be more diverse than those
   obtained from the crystal violet media (1.9). The results suggest that

Abstract = {{Reclamation of Brazilian cerrados (savannas) has been intensified in the
   last decades, with implications for soil quality and soil organic matter
   (SOM) dynamics. Studying the impact of different tillage systems is
   essential to define better strategies for land use in Cerrado, which may
   favor C sequestration and improve soil quality. We used density
   fractionation and C-13 natural abundance to assess changes in SOM in an
   Oxisol previously under a cerrado sensu-stricto following 30 years of
   cultivation. The objectives of the study were to: (i) evaluate the
   long-term impact of tillage systems on SOM stocks in a Dark Red Latosol
   (Oxisol) from the Cerrado Biome, and (ii) better understand the dynamics
   of SOM in different density fractions of this soil. Cultivation led to
   compaction, which significantly increased soil bulk density. This
   resulted in the systematic overestimation of C and N stocks in
   cultivated areas when compared to the natural cerrado. Conversion of the
   cerrado into cropland using plow tillage (PT) or no-tillage (NT) system
   did not alter the total C (similar to100 Mg ha(-1)) and N (similar to7
   Mg ha(-1)) stocks in the first 45 cm depth at the end of 30 years of
   cultivation. However, about 22\% of the total C was replaced by C from
   maize. The relative replacement of C decreased following the order: free
   light fraction (F-LF) > heavy fraction (HF) > occluded light fraction
   (O-LF). The low substitution in the O-LF was attributed to a possible
   presence of charcoal. Converting cerrado into cropland significantly
   decreased F-LF quantity. The proportions of C replacement in this
   fraction were higher in PT than NT, suggesting a faster turnover in PT.
   Nevertheless, because most C (similar to95\%) was held in the HF, C
   dynamics in the whole soil were controlled by the behavior of this
   fraction. The maintenance of C levels even at the end of 30 years of
   cultivation and the lack of differentiation between NT and PT were
   attributed to the high clay contents and Fe + Al oxi-hydroxides
   concentrations of the studied soil as well as to a sufficient C supply
   by the maize crop. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural sustainability is enhanced by management practices that
   optimize the performance of multiple agroecosystem functions. The
   performance of western Corn Belt cropping systems was evaluated based on
   four agroecosystem functions: food production, raw materials production,
   nutrient cycling, and greenhouse gas regulation. A simple multiattribute
   ranking procedure was used to quantify agroecosystem performance using
   data from a long-term cropping systems experiment near Mead, NE.
   Treatments included in the procedure were continuous corn (Zea mays L.)
   (CC), corn-soybean {[}Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] (C-SB), corn-oat (Avena
   saliva L.) + clover {[}80\% sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis L.) and
   20\% red clover (Trifolium pratense L.)]-sorghum {[}Sorghum bicolor (L.)
   Moench]-soybean (C-OCL-SG-SB), and corn-soybean-sorghum-oat + clover
   (C-SB-SG-OCL) each at three N fertilization levels (ZERO, LOW, and
   HIGH). Based on treatment averages of soil and crop indicators from 1983
   to 1998, agroecosystem performance scores ranged from 66.6 to 77.3, with
   a least significant difference (LSD) between treatments of 2.2 (P <
   0.05). Treatments with the highest scores included C-OCL-SG-SG-SB/LOW
   (77.3), C-SB/LOW (76.9), CC/LOW (76.7), CC/HIGH (76.6), and
   C-SB-SG-OCL/LOW (75.3). Among these treatments, those fertilized at the
   LOW N rate attained high scores through moderate performance in all four
   agroecosystem functions. The CC/HIGH treatment, however, attained a high
   score solely through its superior capacity to be highly productive, as
   its scores for the two environmental quality-related functions were the
   lowest among all treatments. Correlations between production- and
   environmental protection-related functions were negative, emphasizing
   the importance of employing management practices that are productive yet
   minimize deleterious environmental impacts.}},

   significantly lower than current technology prices, necessitating a 60\%
   government subsidy to induce adoption, on average. Agronomic factors
   such as soil characteristic variability and soil quality are important
   determinants of WTP. In addition, how well the technology integrates
   into current farming practices and equipment also appears important.}},

Abstract = {{Dehesas, rangelands occupied by scattered oak trees and characterized by
   silvopastoral uses, cover about 3.1 million ha in south-western Spain.
   There is considerable debate about the long-term persistence of holm oak
   (Quercus ilex) populations in dehesas, since most stands are overaged
   and seedlings and saplings are sparse. The forest cycle has been
   disrupted in most dehesas. Regeneration has been inhibited since stands
   were opened for agriculture and grazing. Oak diameters from three
   land-use groups (young dehesa {[}YD], middle-aged dehesa {[}MD], and old
   dehesa {[}OD]) in Caceres Province, Spain, were compared. These groups
   differed in the age of the land-use system, i.e. time since the original
   Mediterranean forest wag cleared. The dehesa systems were established
   about 80 (YD), 150 (MD) and 500 (OD) years ago. An analysis of 66 holm
   oak cross sections revealed a close correlation (r(2) = 91.2\%) between
   tree rings and diameters, so that diameter seems to be a reliable
   indicator of tree age. Nested analysis of variance showed significant
   variation in diameters between the land-use groups. There is generally a
   positive relationship between tree age and the age of agrosilvopastoral
   use of the dehesas. Sparse holm oaks in the dehesas are primarily
   remnants from the first forest cycle. Local differences in growth
   conditions (for example soil quality and tree density) contribute
   further significant diameter variation on a between-plot level. Diameter
   structure of abandoned dehesas showed two peaks and a high proportion of
   trees in the smallest size class. This indicates that the forest
   degradation process is reversible. An effective,regeneration policy
   should promote a rotating 20- to 30-year set-aside of dehesa parcels.}},

Abstract = {{The reestablisment of autochthonous plant species is an essential
   strategy for recovering degraded areas under semiarid conditions. A
   field experiment was carried out to assess the short-term effect of two
   reafforestation methods involving mycorrhizal inoculation and compost
   addition on soil quality parameters and Rhamnus lycioides seedling
   growth. The nutrient content (NPK) and enzymatic activities
   (dehydrogenase, urease, protease-BAA, acid phosphatase and
   beta-glucosidase) increased and bulk density decreased in the
   rhizosphere soil with the organic amendment. Biomass C of rhizosphere
   soil increased by at least 240\% with respect to the control soil after
   mycorrhizal inoculation and the combination of compost addition +
   mycorrhizal inoculation. Both mycorrhizal inoculation and composted
   organic residue addition increased P. lycioides seedling growth in the
   same proportion. In the short term, we conclude that the application of
   both reafforestation methods not only enhances the establishment of R.
   lycioides seedlings, but also improves soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality is one of the most important environmental factors in
   sustaining the global biosphere and developing sustainable agricultural
   practices. A study was initiated in Wolong Nature Reserve, Sichuan
   Province, China to elucidate the soil quality changes of natural
   secondary succession, forest planting and agricultural practices after
   deforestation in the humid mountainous region. The soil qualities of six
   land use types (natural forestland, grassland, shrub land, secondary
   forestland, cultivated land and reforested land) were compared using two
   quantitative methods: the integrated soil quality index (QI) and soil
   deterioration index (DI). The QI values of natural forestland,
   grassland, shrub land, secondary forestland, cultivated land, reforested
   land were 0.8039, 0.3277, 0.9127, 0.6881, 0.0285 and 0.3183,
   respectively. The DI values were 0 \%, - 14 \%, 12 \%, 1 \%, - 26 \% and
   - 18 \% respectively. Both indexes suggested that shrub, land can
   restore soil properties. To compare the two methods more directly, a
   deduced index QI' based on QI value was developed. The results showed
   that DI and QI' had a very high linear correlation coefficient (r =
   0.9775) despite the values were different. Both methods were efficient
   in evaluating the soil quality levels and DI was a more simple way in
   soil quality assessment, while QI could show more ecological meanings.}},

Abstract = {{State-and-transition models have received a great deal of attention
   since the introduction of the concept to range management in 1989.
   Nonetheless, only recently have sets of state-and-transition models been
   produced that can be used by agency personnel and private citizens, and
   there is little guidance available for developing and interpreting
   models. Based upon our experiences developing models for the state of
   New Mexico, we address the following questions: 1) how is information
   assembled to create site-specific models for entire regions, 2) what
   ecological issues should be considered in model development and
   classification, and 3) how should models be used? We review the general
   structure of state-and-transition models, emphasizing the distinction
   between changes among communities within states (pathways) that are
   reversible with changes in climate and ``facilitating practices{''}
   (e.g. grazing management), and changes among states (transitions) that
   are reversible only with ``accelerating practices{''} such as seeding,
   shrub control, or the recovery of soil stability and historical
   hydrologic function. Both pathways and transitions occur, so these
   models are complementary. Ecological sites and the climatically-defined
   regions within which they occur (land resource units) serve as a
   framework for developing and selecting models. We illustrate the
   importance of clearly delineating ecological sites to produce models and
   describe how we have dealt with poorly-delineated sites. Producing
   specific models requires an understanding of the multiple ecological
   mechanisms underlying transitions. We show how models can represent and
   distinguish alternative and complementary hypotheses for transitions.
   Although there may be several mechanisms underlying transitions, they
   tend to fall within discrete categories based upon a few, fundamental
   ecological processes and their relationships can be readily understood.
   A knowledge of, mechanisms is closely related to the use of ecological
   indicators to anticipate transitions. We conclude that models should
   include 1) reference values for quantitative indicators, 2) lists of key
   indicators and descriptions of changes in them that suggest an approach
   to a transition, and 3) a rigorous documentation of the theory and
   assumptions (and their alternatives) underlying the structure of each
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Disposal of urban, agricultural and industrial organic residues implies
   an increasing problem because of all the economic and environmental
   repercussions involved. One of the most adequate ways of managing this
   problem is the agricultural use of these wastes as organic amendments.
   Three organic residues (AC, olive mill waste water sludge compost; MWC,
   municipal solid waste compost; and PS, paper mill sludge) were used in a
   3-year field experiment involving orange production. The effect of their
   application on crop production and on soil quality was investigated.
   Soil samples (0-20 cm depth) collected 11 months after the last soil
   amendment were analysed for: pH and EC, Kjeldahl-N, available-P,
   available-K, total organic carbon, humic substances, dehydrogenase,
   phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, urease and benzoyl-argininamide
   hydrolysing protease (BAA-protease) activities. Generally, the
   application of the MWC and PS increased orange yield when compared to
   control. Moreover, total organic carbon and humic substances
   significantly increased in soils treated with all the organic
   amendments. Organic fertilisation increased the Kjeldahl-N and
   available-P contents of the soil. The application of the organic
   residues also caused significant increases in dehydrogenase,
   beta-glucosidase, urease and BAA-protease activities of the soil.
   Significant positive correlations (p < 0.01) between these enzymatic
   activities and total organic carbon were found for all treatments.
   Significant positive correlation between dehydrogenase, urease,
   \&beta;-glucosidase, and BAA-protease and orange yield was also found.
   However, a clear inhibition of phosphatase activity was observed in
   soils treated with PS. The results indicate that the repeated
   application to the soil of moderate amounts of organic amendments has
   positive effects on the chemical and biochemical properties of the soil,
   as well as on the orange yield.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality and pedology are similar in their melding of concepts and
   disciplines and their reliance on the model of soil formation described
   by jenny in 1980. They differ in spatial and temporal scales and in the
   organisms concerned. In this regard, soil quality can be considered part
   of the science of pedology. Significant differences in selected
   near-surface soil properties and subsequent interpretations as
   influenced by land use are illustrative of the need to collect data
   reflecting use-dependent or dynamic soil properties. Inherent or
   use-invariant properties dictate the limits to which dynamic properties
   range. As pedologists begin to explore these relationships, a dynamic
   soil properties database should be developed as a companion to the
   database of use-invariant properties used currently for classification,

Abstract = {{Surface horizons of Rhodic Paleudults in the Tenneswe Valley region of
   Alabama contain large amounts of clay (<2 mum) composed of quartz,
   kaolinite, hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite, and iron oxides. Similar
   clay mineralogical suites have been shown to be dispersive, which can
   lead to the degradation of soil physical properties. Furthermore, some
   studies have suggested mineralogical enrichment in dispersed colloids
   versus in situ soil, which can effect transport of sediment-attached
   pollutants. The historical utilization of conventional tillage practices
   without cover crops has degraded soil quality in this region; however,
   reduced tillage systems are becoming common. We evaluated clay
   dispersibility and mineralogical partitioning for fine, kaolinitic,
   thermic Rhodic Paleudults cropped to cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in:
   (i) a no-till system without a cover crop (NT), (ii) a no-till system
   with a rye (Secale cerea e L.) cover crop (NTC), (iii) a no-till system
   with a rye cover crop and fall paratilling (NTCP), and (iv) a
   conventional tillage system (disking and chisel plowing in the fall
   followed by disking in spring) (CT). Water dispersible clay (WDC),
   extractable Fe, and soil organic carbon (SOC) were evaluated for surface
   (0-1 cm) samples. Particle size distribution (PSD) and clay mineralogy
   of in situ soil, runoff sediment, and WDC were also determined. Data
   indicated Fe oxides play a more significant role in clay aggregation
   than soil organic matter (SOM) in these high Fe systems. Higher clay
   amounts were recovered with dithionite extractable Fe removed (Fed)
   compared with SOM removal (33 +/- 3\% vs 25 +/- 4\%). The WDC quantities
   were related to SOC (r(2) = 0.65) and negatively correlated with Fed
   (\%) and water stable aggregates (\%). Particle size and mineralogy of
   runoff sediment and WDC mineralogy were similar to in situ soil,
   suggesting models depicting erosion and sediment-attached pollutant
   transport can be developed using in situ soil as a surrogate for
   sediment characterization in these soils.}},

Abstract = {{Crop rotations and manure application are thought to alter soil quality.
   This study was conducted to quantify the effects of over 100 yr of
   continuous crop management and annual manure applications on selected
   soil physical properties at Sanborn Field, Columbia, MO. Intact soil
   cores (76 non i.d. by 76 mm) were collected from continuous corn (Zea
   mays L.), continuous wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), continuous timothy
   (Phleum pratense L.), and a rotation of corn-wheat-red clover (Trifolium
   pratense L.). The soil was Mexico silt loam (fine, smectitic, mesic,
   Aeric Vertic Epiaqualfs). Soil was tested throughout a 1-yr period for
   aggregate stability, single-drop rainfall splash detachment, and soil
   shear strength. Cropping systems affected aggregate stability (P <
   0.01), soil strength (P < 0.01), and splash detachment (P < 0.01), but
   not bulk density. Continuous cropping to timothy produced soil that had
   three to four times greater aggregate stability, 21 to 27\% greater soil
   strength, and 55 to 67\% less soil splash compared with continuous wheat
   or continuous corn. Season significantly affected all measured soil
   properties, but the effect was inconsistent. The highest aggregate
   stability was found during July for all treatments. Splash detachment
   was more sensitive to cropping systems than other soil measures, and
   thereby the best measure for evaluating changes in soil erodibility.
   Cropping and soil management that accumulate plant residues can improve
   soil quality by increasing soil aggregate stability, shear strength, and
   resistance to splash detachment.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) is a complex mixture, which influences a
   number of soil properties and nutrient cycling, and is itself influenced
   in kind and amount by land-use, soil type, climate and vegetation. There
   is considerable concern that, if SOM concentrations in soils are allowed
   to decrease too much, then the productive capacity of agriculture will
   be compromised by deterioration in soil physical properties and by
   impairment of soil nutrient cycling mechanisms. This has clear
   implications for the sustainable use of soil. We have focussed our
   discussion from the standpoint of the sustainability of UK agriculture,
   because we know that best, but similar concerns are equally valid
   elsewhere in the world. Although soil scientists would expect to find
   different behaviour in different soils at different `critical'
   concentrations of SOM, it seems widely believed that a major threshold
   is 2\% soil organic carbon (SOC) (ca. 3.4\% SOM), below which
   potentially serious decline in soil quality will occur.
   This review summarises what is known about critical thresholds of SOC or
   SOM, mainly in soils of temperate regions. It examines critically the
   quantitative, rather than anecdotal or descriptive, evidence for such
   thresholds and their potential effects on soil quality, soil physical
   properties and crop nutrition, and the links between these.
   We conclude that the quantitative evidence for such thresholds is
   slight, although there is some evidence that there might be an desirable
   range of SOC covering a wide spectrum of soils, but again the
   quantitative evidence for this needs considerable development. There is
   also little quantitative evidence that reduction in SOC concentrations
   in the soils of England and Wales will have marked effects on other soil
   properties or crop yields. The data do suggest, however, that more
   research is required on the nature of SOC, particularly of the so-called
   `active' or `fresh' fraction and its influence on the properties of a
   range of soil types under different land uses. This is particularly
   relevant to the ongoing debate about soil quality, its definition, and
   the identification of appropriate indicators that relate soil quality to
   soil functions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction in pasture productivity is generally attributed to alterations
   in soil quality. Soil compaction due to animal trampling is one of the
   factors responsible for the degradation of the physical quality of soils
   under pasture. The objective of the study was to evaluate penetrometer
   resistance (PR) in an irrigated short-duration grazing system at three
   post-graze residue levels. PR and moisture were simultaneously measured
   in plots containing three different post-graze residue levels (1000,
   2500 and 4000 kg dry material ha(-1)). The influence of soil moisture on
   PR was taken into account using regression analysis techniques. PR was
   significantly higher for the treatments characterized by a small amount
   of post-graze residue, while similar values were obtained for the other
   two treatments. From a management perspective, adopting an irrigated
   short-duration grazing system with high stocking rate may adversely
   affect the soil physical quality. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The utility of mulching in various forestry applications remains unclear
   due to mixed results in field trials. Additionally, few studies have
   attempted to assess the utility of mulching across a range of
   conditions, to determine the circumstances that maximize the degree and
   longevity of mulching-related enhancements. The objective of this study
   was to gauge the effect of black polyethylene mulch (poly mulch) across
   a range of site conditions, weed-control treatments and genotypes in a
   short-rotation, poplar plantation, to describe the circumstances that
   maximize the benefits of mulching on early growth and survival. Poplar
   plantations composed of one native clone (Populus deltoides Bartr.
   {[}D105]) and one hybrid clone (P. nigra L. x P. maximowiczii A. Henry
   {[}NM6]) were established in a randomized complete-block design (2.4 m x
   3 m spacing) during May, 1999, under intensive and minimal weed-control
   strategies at two sites of different soil quality. Nested within each
   weed-control treatment was an assessment of tree performance using poly
   mulch vs. no mulch. Stein volume increments (SVI, dm(3)) were measured
   on trees in all treatments during the 1999 and 2000 growing seasons.
   During establishment (1999), poly mulch enhanced SVI in all treatment
   combinations. In the second year, the benefit of mulching was restricted
   to conditions of higher vegetative competition and lower site quality.
   The relative benefit of poly mulch (i.e., the ratio of SVI under mulched
   vs. non-mulched conditions) increased in the second year in conditions
   of high vegetative competition at both sites, while it decreased in the
   intensively managed plots at both the sites. Tree survival exceeded 90\%
   for both the clones in all treatment combinations, except under the
   greatest vegetative competition (i.e., high-quality site with minimal
   weed control), where survival for D105 fell below 40\% in both mulched
   and non-mulched conditions. While poly mulch may improve early growth in
   short-rotation, woody crop plantations under a wide range of conditions,
   its practical utility appears to be restricted to specific applications.
   At the high-quality site in this study, mulching showed little potential
   as an economically feasible tool under either intensive weed control
   (due to the rapid attrition of mulching benefits) or minimal weed
   control (due to low survival and slow growth). Conversely, on marginal
   sites poly mulch may provide a more attractive management option in both
   intensive and minimal weed-control applications, particularly for
   certain clones. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   So, we investigated the effects of certain parameters (small differences

   reproduction of F candida. We show that a 1 degreesC difference has no
   perceptible effect but that a 1 day difference in age has. Studying the

   interindividual variability exists. Lastly, we compared the variability
   of reproduction in two tests differing from one another in duration;
   variability was clearly decreased by lengthening the test. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The comparison of selected soil mechanical parameters measured on
   plastic soils under remoulded and structurally intact conditions may
   provide an opportunity to assess soil structural quality on. a regional
   or even broader scale. This study was conducted to determine: (i) if
   existing pedotransfer functions developed for southwestern Ontario soils
   could be used outside this physiographic region, and (ii) if key
   mechanical parameters were sensitive to a range of land use conditions
   that are likely to influence soil structural quality. Soil profiles were
   sampled in natural (forested or grassland), agricultural and pipeline
   workspace areas (land use variable) located in southwestern Ontario,
   eastern Ontario, Alberta and Texas (mineralogy variable). Slurry
   consolidation and uniaxial compression tests were conducted on remoulded
   and structurally intact samples, the resulting void ratio-log stress
   {[}e(logsigma')]data were fitted to linear or nonlinear model equations,
   respectively, and several key mechanical parameters were derived. The
   effective stresses at the liquid and plastic limits could not be
   adequately estimated for soils with smectitic mineralogy using existing
   pedotransfer functions because of the absence of a significant
   relationship with organic carbon content. The difference between void
   ratio intercepts for remoulded and structurally intact soils (e({*})
   (1kPa) - e(0)) was found to be a suitable indicator of physical soil
   quality because of the convergence of remoulded and structured
   compression lines in e(logsigma') co-ordinates. Severely
   overconsolidated soils were identified when the (e({*}) (1kPa) - e(0))
   variable exceeded 0.40. This threshold also corresponded to soil
   conditions that could limit plant growth.}},

Abstract = {{Light fraction of soil organic C (LFOC) represents a major portion of
   labile soil organic C (SOC) and is a key attribute of soil quality. Soil
   respiration (C-min) is an important index depicting the potential
   activity of the labile SOC. Six field experiments, varying in duration
   (8 to 25 yr), in location (Brown, Dark Brown and Black Chernozemic soil
   zones of Saskatchewan) and soil texture, were conducted to evaluate the
   impact of tillage and crop rotations on crop production and soil
   quality. We sampled the 0-7.5-cm depth of soil in these experiments to
   determine the treatment effects on LFOC, the proportion of LFOC in the
   SOC (LFOC/SOC) and C-min. Increasing the frequency of summer fallow in
   cropping systems decreased the LFOC in all soil zones; it also decreased
   the proportion of LFOC in SOC and C-min. Tillage had little impact on
   LFOC in the Brown and Dark Brown Chernozemic soil zones, although it
   significantly decreased LFOC in the Black Chernozemic soil zone. Thus,
   crop rotation had a greater impact on LFOC than tillage. Tillage did not
   influence C-min in any soil zone. Because adoption of no-till management
   increased SOC in all soil zones, we concluded that LFOC was not a
   sensitive indicator of the impact of tillage on this soil quality
   attribute for these Chernozemic soils in Saskatchewan. We also found
   that LFOC/SOC is directly proportional to sand content. This
   relationship may assist us in partitioning SOC pools with differing
   turnover times when modeling SOC dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing attention paid to local soil knowledge in recent years is
   the result of a greater recognition that the knowledge of people who
   have been interacting with their soils for long time can offer many
   insights about the sustainable management of tropical soils. This paper
   describes two approaches in the process of eliciting local information.
   Case studies show that there is a consistent rational basis to the use
   of local indicators of soil quality and their relation to improved soil
   management. The participatory process used is shown to have considerable
   potential in facilitating farmer consensus about which soil-related
   constraints should be tackled first. Consensus building is presented as
   an important step prior to collective action by farming communities in
   integrated soil management at the landscape scale. Taking advantage of
   the complementary nature of local and scientific knowledge is
   highlighted as an overall strategy for sustainable soil management. (C)

Abstract = {{This research explores the commonalities and differences between local
   farmers' understanding of soil quality in a small catchment in central
   Honduras and that of a US soil scientist. The authors investigated the
   ways in which the local farmers categorized and managed soils and land
   uses. The US soil scientist also conducted independent measurements and
   analyses for varying indicators of soil quality throughout the
   catchment. There were both differences and similarities between the two
   views of soil quality. Farmers' understanding of soil quality was
   heavily influenced by the fact that agricultural production was their
   primary concern, while the soil scientist had a more holistic view of
   plant productivity. Broader scale movement of soil and water was not a
   particular concern of the fanners, despite the occurrence of mass
   wasting and slumping every year. Landform type was a key management
   variable for both, however, as were soil texture and drainage patterns.

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is twofold: first, to describe the dynamics
   of the traditional farming system (TFS) of a rural indigenous community
   in Central Mexico and second, to detect the contribution of local
   knowledge to potential indicators of sustainable development.
   The method included the following steps: (a) field description of the
   TFS; (b) survey of local knowledge on both landscape and land qualities;
   (c) soil and maize grain yield sampling; and (d) statistical analyses
   relating local knowledge to field and laboratory data. A participatory
   approach was used; every field technique was carried out together with
   local producers.
   Statistical analyses of both field and laboratory data proved the
   consistency of peasant-defined land quality classes. Land quality was
   related to the distribution of available P, slope position and depth of
   recent volcanic ash cover. In addition, we detected a well-structured
   relief and soil quality knowledge-base.
   The TFS is a highly complex integrated scheme serving as a conceptual
   basis for decision-making procedures. The TFS does not attempt to
   maximize profit in cash. Its goal is self-sufficiency. These principles
   are at the core of decision-making procedures. The system represents a
   substantial part of the culture of Nuevo San Juan traditional producers.
   Family participation in the TFS is a key element; self-sufficiency gives
   security to the family. This explains the survival of the TFS despite
   its drawbacks, basically of a social nature rather than a technical
   nature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The decline of cooking banana production in parts of East Africa has
   been associated with a loss of soil fertility and increased pest
   pressure. Previous work indicated that the use of mineral fertilizers at
   recommended rates is not financially viable on plantations where pest
   pressure is high. The objectives of this study were to determine the
   effects of half the recommended rates of mineral fertilizers and organic
   mulch on banana yield, soil and foliar nutrient status, soil water and
   pest damage in the central region of Uganda. The study was conducted in
   a four-year old banana plantation infested with weevils. Treatments
   consisted of mineral fertilizer alone, mulch alone, a combination of
   mulch with fertilizer, and a control (no mulch from outside the plot, or
   mineral fertilizer applied). Fruit yield was generally low (mean of 7.4
   Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and increases above the control ranged from 1.1 to 2.0
   Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). Banana yield was significantly higher in the sole
   mulch treatment than in the control. However, there were no significant
   differences in yield among the treatments that received external inputs.
   Thus, there was no demonstrable yield advantage of combining mineral
   fertilizer with mulch. At the end of the trial, soil K concentrations in
   the two treatments that were mulched, were almost twice those of the
   control, but this difference was not statistically significant.
   Concentrations of Ca and Mg did not differ with treatment. Soil
   available P significantly increased when mineral fertilizer and organic
   mulch were combined. Treatments that received organic mulch were lower
   in foliar concentrations of N and Mg, and higher in K. Soil water
   content was greater in the surface soil layer in the treatments that
   received mulch, presumably due to less surface run-off and evaporation,
   since there was no change in surface soil porosity. The effect of
   organic and inorganic amendments had no impact on weevil damage, which
   remained above 5\% at the end of the trial. We conclude that where
   weevil damage is over 5\% of the cross section near the collar, banana
   production may not be economically increased through use of either
   mineral fertilizer and/or organic mulch.}},

Abstract = {{New Zealand is highly dependent on its soil resource for continued
   agricultural production. To avoid depleting this resource, there is a
   need to identify soils and associated land management practices where
   there is a risk of soil degradation. Environmental integrity and
   ecosystem services also need to be maintained. Accordingly, to ensure
   sustainable production, the on- and off site environmental impacts of
   land management need to be identified and managed. We developed a
   structural vulnerability index for New Zealand soils. This index ranks
   soils according to their inherent susceptibility to physical degradation
   when used for agricultural (pasture, forestry and cropping) purposes. We
   also developed a rule-based model to assess soil compaction
   vulnerability by characterising the combined effects of resistance and
   resilience. Other soil attributes have been appraised using seven
   chemical, physical and biological indicators of soil quality. These
   indicators have been applied in a nation-wide project involving data
   collection from over 500 sites for a range of land uses. These soil
   quality data can be interpreted via the World Wide Web - through the
   interactive decision-support tool SINDI. The land-use impact model is a
   framework to assess agricultural land management and environmental
   sustainability, and may be applied to land units at any scale. Using
   land resource data and information the model explicitly identifies
   hazards to land productivity and environmental integrity. It utilises
   qualitative expert and local knowledge and quantitative model-based
   evaluations to assess the potential environmental impacts of
   land-management practices. The model is linked to a geographic
   information system (GIS), allowing model outputs, such as the
   environmental impacts of site-specific best management practices, to be
   identified in a spatially explicit manner. The model has been tested in
   New Zealand in an area of pastoral land use. Advantages of this risk
   identification model include: utilising current knowledge of the causes
   and effects of land-management practices on soil degradation; linking
   land management practice to both on- and off-site environmental
   consequences; identifying important gaps in local knowledge; and
   providing spatially explicit information on the environmental impact of
   land-management practices.}},

Title = {{Hydropedology: Bridging Disciplines, Scales, and Data}},
Journal = {{VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing recognition that synergy could be generated by
   bridging traditional pedology with soil physics and hydrology to enhance
   integrated studies of soil-water relationships across spatial and
   temporal scales. Hydropedology is suggested as such a bridge to address:
   (i) knowledge gaps between pedology, soil physics, and hydrology; (ii)
   multiscale bridging from microscopic to mesoscopic and macroscopic
   levels; and (iii) data translations from soil survey databases into soil
   hydraulic information. Knowledge gaps include flow and transport in the
   structured unsaturated zone, soil structure quantification, preferential
   flow modeling, landscape hydrology, soil spatial and temporal
   variability, quantitative use of field soil morphology for inferring
   soil hydrology, mechanisms controlling individual and interactive
   soil-water processes at multiple scales, pedotransfer functions (PTFs),
   and others. Hydropedology integrates the pedon and landscape paradigms
   to link phenomena occurring at microscopic (e.g., pores and aggregates),
   mesoscopic (e.g., pedons and catenas), and macroscopic (e.g.,
   watersheds, regional, and global) scales. Through approaches such as
   PTFs, hydropedology also facilitates the bridging of data between soil
   survey databases and soil hydraulic information needed in simulation
   models. The bridging of disciplines, scales, and data represents
   potentially unique contributions of hydropedology to integrated soil and
   water sciences. It is hoped that hydropedology would contribute to our
   enhanced understanding of a variety of environmental, ecological,
   agricultural, and natural resource issues of societal importance. These
   include water quality, soil quality, landscape processes, watershed
   management, nutrient cycling, contaminant fate, waste disposal,
   precision agriculture, climate change, and ecosystem functions.}},

Abstract = {{Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) of sewage sludge management in
   a Danish municipality (Aalborg), with 160,000 inhabitants using
   alternative methods for aggregation of environmental impacts was
   performed. The purpose is to demonstrate the use of SEA in relation to
   sludge management and to improve SEA methodology. Six different
   scenarios for management of sewage sludge within the Aalborg
   municipality involving thermal treatment, composting and landfilling of
   sludge were evaluated. Environmental impact categories considered were
   global warming, non-renewable resources (nutrients and fossil fuels) and
   land use. Impact categories human health, ecotoxicity and soil quality
   were excluded as methodology for their assessment is not yet fully
   developed. Thermal sludge treatment with energy utilisation was shown to
   be a promising option for sewage sludge management in Aalborg.
   Sensitivity of the relative environmental impacts with respect to
   calculation methodology and input parameter values were evaluated to
   identify important parameters and calculation methods. The analysis
   showed that aggregation procedures, sludge biogas potential and sludge
   production were very important whereas sludge transport was not.}},

Abstract = {{A Mediterranean soil affected by long-term crop management systems was
   evaluated to identify the best indicators of its quality. Selected
   characteristics included total soil organic carbon (TOC), light fraction
   carbon (LFC), acid hydrolyzable and water-soluble carbohydrates carbon
   (AHG-C and WSC-C), phenolic carbon (PC), mineralizable carbon (Q),
   microbial biomass carbon (MB-C) and metabolic quotients (qCO(2) and qD).
   Soil samples were taken under natural grass (NG), an orange grove (OG),
   winter wheat (WW) and horticultural cropping (HC). The results show that
   WW and HC reduced different C fractions probably due to the routine
   annual ploughing and low inputs of plant residues compared with the
   undisturbed system (NG). The OG, receiving more organic matter and not
   tilled for seven years, showed intermediate values. Among the different
   indices for assessing quantity changes due to management practices, LFC
   and Q appeared to be the best. However, when the amounts of the
   different C parameters were expressed as percentages of TOC, most of the
   differences between the soils in the management systems disappeared.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this series of studies was to investigate the use of
   compost and mulch materials in erosion control and stabilization
   projects. The first phase of the study primarily looked at the impacts
   of surface blankets of twelve different compost and mulch materials on
   total solids (TS) loss and water quality and found that mulch blankets
   produced runoff with the lowest TS and nutrient contents. Compost
   blankets were significantly less erodible than bare soil. Compost
   maturity seemed to be an important factor as respiration rate was
   significantly correlated to TS loss. Raw poultry litter produced more
   runoff and erosion than bare soil and three different poultry litter
   composts. Effective erosion control strategies must both protect the
   soil surface and establish and sustain vegetation. The second part of
   this project looked at the impacts of these same materials on grass
   establishment end growth. The findings indicated that the compost
   treatments produced more vegetative biomass and cover than the mulch
   treatments. The final phase of this study compared four combinations of
   compost blankets and berms to both bare soil and conventional treatments
   such as hydroseeding and silt fences. Preliminary results indicate that
   the use of compost blankets and berms offer significant improvements in
   water quality through improved erosion control, reduction in nutrient
   loads, and improved the establishment of vegetation. Further analysis is
   on-going to document the long term changes in soil quality and
   vegetation using these treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture is a resource-intensive enterprise. The manner in which food
   production systems utilize resources has a large influence on
   environmental quality. To evaluate prospects for conserving natural
   resources while meeting increased demand for cereals, we interpret
   recent trends and future trajectories in crop yields, land and nitrogen
   fertilizer use, carbon sequestration, and greenhouse gas emissions to
   identify key issues and challenges. Based on this assessment, we
   conclude that avoiding expansion of cultivation into natural ecosystems,
   increased nitrogen use efficiency, and improved soil quality are pivotal
   components of a sustainable agriculture that meets human needs and
   protects natural resources. To achieve this outcome will depend on
   raising the yield potential and closing existing yield gaps of the major
   cereal crops to avoid yield stagnation in some of the world's most
   productive systems. Recent trends suggest, however, that increasing crop
   yield potential is a formidable scientific challenge that has proven to
   be an elusive goal.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional agriculture has had major environmental impacts, in
   particular with respect to soil degradation. Soil structure, fertility,
   microbial and faunal biodiversity have declined, and root diseases are
   common unless genetic resistance, soil fumigation and/or seed treatments
   are used. Primarily for environmental reasons and increasing demands for
   safe and healthy food from the public, farmers have switched over to
   organic production at an increasing rate. During a transition period of
   about 5 years, organic farmers may face problems with yield losses and
   pest or disease problems. However, in well-managed, long-term organic
   farms, soilborne diseases need not be a problem. Several studies in
   which disease severity was compared in organic and conventional farming
   systems (or with soils from those systems) showed that root diseases are
   generally less severe in organically than conventionally managed soils.
   The reasons for reduced root disease severity have seldom been
   investigated, although relationships with nitrogen supply or microbial
   diversity have sometimes been found. Crop protection in organic farming
   is generally not directed at controlling particular pathogens or pests
   but at management of the environment so that plants are able to
   withstand potential attacks. Resistant cultivars adapted to the local
   conditions are in demand among organic farmers. However, the main
   practices that contribute to disease control are long, balanced
   rotations, organic amendments and reduced tillage, all geared towards
   maintenance of the soil organic matter content and fertility. Organic
   farmers can make use of biological control agents and natural toxic
   compounds in plant extracts. However, these practices are methods of
   last resort.}},

Abstract = {{Light-textured soils (<35\% clay) make up more than 80\%, by area, of
   cropping soils in Australia. Many have inherent soil physical problems,
   e. g. hardsetting, sodicity and low organic carbon levels. Maintenance
   and improvement of soil organic carbon levels are crucial to preserving
   the soil structure and physical fertility of these soils.
   A review of field trials on conservation tillage (3-19 years duration)
   on these soils in southern Australia revealed that significantly higher
   soil organic carbon levels compared with conventional tillage were found
   only in the wetter areas (>500 mm) and the differences were restricted
   to the top 2.5-10.0 cm. The average magnitude of the difference was
   lower than that reported in the USA. The lack of a positive response to
   conservation tillage is probably a reflection of a number of factors,
   namely low crop yield ( due to low rainfall), partial removal of stubble
   by grazing and the high decomposition rate ( due to the high
   temperature). There is evidence suggesting that under continuous
   cropping in the drier areas, the soil organic carbon level continues to
   decline, even under conservation tillage.
   Better soil structure and soil physical properties, namely
   macro-porosity, aggregate stability and higher infiltration have been
   reported under conservation tillage when compared with conventional
   tillage. However, little information on long-term changes of these
   properties under conservation tillage is available. As many of these
   soil qualities are associated directly or indirectly with soil organic
   carbon levels, the lack of significant increase in the latter suggests
   that many of these improvements may not be sustainable in the longer
   term, particularly in the drier areas. Continuous monitoring of
   long-term changes in the soil organic carbon and soil quality under
   conservation tillage in different agro-ecological zones is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) fertilisers are an essential input for the economic
   production of legume-based pastures in New Zealand (NZ) and Australia,
   but they often contain some unwanted elements that can contaminate the
   soil, thereby creating potential risks to the health of grazing animal,
   food quality, and soil quality. Fluorine (F) and cadmium (Cd) are
   considered to be the elements of most concern. Incidences of F toxicity
   (from direct ingestion of fertiliser), and accumulation of Cd in offal
   products above the maximum permissible concentration (MPC) set by the
   food authorities, have been reported in NZ. Similarly, Cd concentrations
   in some food grains may exceed the newly proposed MPCs by the Australian
   and New Zealand Food Authority. Cadmium and F continue to accumulate in
   the topsoils of NZ and Australian pastures as a result of P fertiliser
   use. The mobility of both these elements in soils is low and is similar
   to that of P. Risk of ground water contamination from F and Cd applied
   to most NZ pastures is low. The plant uptake of these elements,
   especially F, is also low in most pastoral soils. Cadmium accumulates
   mainly in liver and kidney of grazing animals mostly through herbage
   ingestion, whereas F accumulates mainly in the bones of these animals,
   mostly through soil ingestion. Soil ingestion is highest during the
   wetter winter months and at high stocking rates. Models have been
   developed to assess the impact of fertiliser use on the potential risks
   associated with F and Cd accumulation in soils. Measures to control F
   and Cd accumulation in soils, plants, and grazing animals are presented
   and future research needs are identified.}},

Abstract = {{Soil carbon is an important component of the global carbon cycle with an
   estimated pool of soil organic carbon of about 1500 Gt. There are few
   estimates of the pool of inorganic carbon, but it is thought to be
   approximately 50\% of the organic carbon pool. There is no detailed
   study on the estimation of the soil carbon pool for Australian soils.
   In order to quantify the carbon pools and to determine the extent of
   spatial variability in the organic and inorganic carbon pools, 120 soil
   cores were taken down to a depth of 0.90 m from a typical cotton field
   in northern NSW. Three cores were also taken from nearby virgin bushland
   and these samples were used as paired samples. Each soil core was
   separated into 4 samples, i. e. 0 - 0.15, 0.15 - 0.30, 0.30 - 0.60, and
   0.60 - 0.90 m. Soil organic carbon was determined by wet oxidation and
   inorganic carbon content was determined using the difference between
   total carbon and organic carbon, and confirmed by the acid dissolution
   method. Total carbon was measured using a LECO CHN analyser.
   Soil organic carbon of the field constituted 62\% ( 0 - 0.15 m), 58\% (
   0.15 - 0.30 m), 60\% ( 0.30 - 0.60 m), and 67\% ( 0.60 - 0.90 m) of the
   total soil carbon. The proportion of inorganic carbon in total carbon is
   higher than the global average of 32\%. Organic carbon content was
   relatively higher in the deeper layers (> 0.30 m) of the studied soils (
   Vertosols) compared with other soil types of Australia. The carbon
   content varied across the field; however, there was little correlation
   between the soil types ( grey, red, or intergrade colour) and carbon
   content. The total soil carbon pool of the studied field was estimated
   to be about 78 t/ ha for 0 - 0.90 m layer, which was approximately 58\%
   of the total soil carbon in the soil under nearby remnant bushland ( 136
   t/ ha).
   The total pool of carbon in the cotton soils of NSW was estimated to be
   44.8 Mt C, where organic carbon and inorganic carbon constitute 34.9 Mt
   C and 9.9 Mt C, respectively. Based on the results of a limited number
   of paired sites under remnant vegetation, it was estimated that about
   18.9 Mt of C has been lost from Vertosols by cotton cropping in NSW.
   With more sustainable management practices such as conservation tillage
   and green manuring, some of the lost carbon can be resequestered, which
   will help to mitigate the greenhouse effect and improve soil quality and
   may increase crop yield.}},

Abstract = {{Fast and convenient soil analytical techniques are needed for soil
   quality assessment and precision soil management. Spectroscopy in the
   ultraviolet (UV, 250-400 nm), visible (VIS, 400-700 nm), and
   near-infrared (NIR, 700-2500 nm) ranges allows rapid acquisition of soil
   information at quantitative, and qualitative or indicator, levels for
   use in agriculture and environmental monitoring. The main objective of
   this study was to evaluate the ability of reflectance spectroscopy in
   the UV, VIS, and NIR ranges to predict several soil properties
   simultaneously. Soil samples (161 surface and subsurface) were used for
   simultaneous estimation of pH, electrical conductivity (EC), air-dry
   gravimetric water content, organic carbon (OC), free iron, clay, sand,
   and silt contents, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and exchangeable
   calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and sodium (Na). Principal
   component regression analyses (PCA) were used to develop calibration
   equations between the reflectance spectral data and measured values for
   the above soil properties obtained by traditional laboratory methods. By
   using randomly selected calibration and validation sets of samples, PCA
   models were able to successfully predict pH, OC, air-dry gravimetric
   water content, clay, CEC, exchangeable Ca, and exchangeable Mg of soil
   samples. The predictions, however, were poor for EC, free iron, sand,
   silt, exchangeable K, and exchangeable Na. The study shows that
   reflectance spectroscopy in the UV-VIS-NIR range has the potential for
   the rapid simultaneous prediction of several soil properties.}},

Abstract = {{Soil biodiversity, the study of the variety of life in the soil, has
   received increasing attention as an outcome of recent national and
   international initiatives, such as the Convention on Biological
   Diversity, and various programs related to sustainable development of
   agroecosystems. The broad objectives of this paper are to set the stage
   for a ``state of the art{''} review of soil biodiversity research in
   Canadian agricultural systems, to highlight the relevance of soil
   biodiversity studies at various scales of observation, to acknowledge
   the importance of soil biodiversity to the soil system with respect to
   soil functions, and processes and to suggest research challenges and
   opportunities.
   Study scale is of critical importance as it determines both the kind of
   soil biodiversity information and the feasible level of detail
   (spatially and temporally). At all scales from global to national to
   regional to landscape to ecosystems ranging to even fine scales of
   habitat niches at soil particle level, soil biota respond to the
   physical, chemical and biological constraints of their environment as
   mediated by environmental and anthropogenic influences. For example, at
   the landscape level, there exists a mosaic of ecosystems that can be
   characterized as a continuum ranging from unmanaged (natural),
   uncontrolled systems regulated primarily by environmental influences to
   managed, controlled systems regulated primarily by anthropogenic
   influences. In agroecosystems, soil biota contribute to the
   decomposition of crop residues and nutrient cycling, soil aggregation
   and water infiltration, suppression of soil-borne diseases and pests,
   and detoxification of chemicals. The intensity and duration of
   environmental and anthropogenic influences on these soil biota will
   affect their spatial and temporal distribution within this continuum of
   ecosystems occurring in the landscape and thereby also affect the extent
   of their capability for contributing towards soil functions and
   processes. Within this spatial and temporal context, research challenges
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Since the ratification of the United Nations Convention on Biological
   Diversity, there has been increased interest in issues related to
   biodiversity, particularly with respect to soil biodiversity and the
   influence of agricultural practices. This paper is one of a series of
   papers contributing to a state of the art review initiated by
   Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada on the status of soil biodiversity
   research in Canada, particularly with respect to agroecosystems. The
   objectives of this paper are to provide an overview of earthworm species
   distribution in Canada by province and territory, and to review research
   that illuminates our understanding of the ecological relationships of
   earthworms in agricultural systems. Most Canadian earthworm species are
   considered exotics having generally been dependent on human activity for
   their introduction and dispersal throughout the Canadian landscape.
   Twenty-seven earthworm species have been identified so far in Canada; of
   these, eight species are native to North America. Suggestions for future
   research on earthworm biodiversity within an agricultural context are
   discussed including: the need for increased spatial and temporal
   information on earthworm distributions across Canada, particularly with
   respect to Canada's varied agroecosystems and landscapes; information on
   the ecology of earthworms with respect to their contributions to the
   soil system and their interactions with other soil fauna; the need for
   ecosystem process models relating earthworm contributions to soil
   structure formation and transport of materials and nutrients within the
   soil system; and the need to determine threshold levels of earthworm
   species associations in order to optimise effectively their
   contributions to soil quality and plant growth. To facilitate these
   studies, expansion of taxonomic expertise and capability across Canada
   will be required.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria in soil are very diverse, very numerous, and functionally
   important, and have historically been an important object of research by
   Canadian microbiologists. Only a small fraction of bacteria in soils are
   amenable to culturing in the laboratory, limiting the ability to study
   these organisms. Canadian scientists have contributed to the development
   and implementation of both nucleic acid-based and chemical
   biomarker-based methods now widely used for assessing soil microbial
   biodiversity without the need for isolation and cultivation. Pesticide
   degradation, and the cycling of nitrogen in soils are used here to
   illustrate the significance of bacterial biodiversity to soil functions
   relevant to human and environmental health, and crop production. There
   remains much to be discovered about the genetic and functional
   biodiversity of soil bacteria, and much to be gained from this
   knowledge. A number of recommendations are made for future research in
   soil bacteriology.}},

Abstract = {{The term ``mycorrhiza{''} refers to the mutualistic symbiosis between
   fungi and the roots of a vast majority of vascular plants, distributed
   over almost any ecosystem. The fungal symbionts, primarily recognized
   for their beneficial impact on plant growth and plant protection, are
   integral components of soil ecosystems and as such, play an active role
   in improving plant productivity and diversity, soil microflora and
   microfauna diversity, and soil quality. Classified among major groups of
   true fungi, the study of their biodiversity and distribution has been
   explored for only a few decades. Major emphasis was first put on the
   mycorrhizal status of plants, on the evaluation of their benefits to
   plant growth, on their geographic distribution and soil inventories, and
   more recently on their relationship to plant diversity and productivity.
   In the 1950s, Canadian scientists were among world pioneers in the field
   of mycorrhizae research and they continue to be recognized by the
   international scientific community. Studies dealing with soil
   biodiversity of mycorrhizal fungi, including arbuscular, ecto-,
   ectendo-, ericoid- and orchid mycorrhizae, performed by Canadian
   researchers are presented here together with strategies and perspectives
   for a better exploitation of mycorrhizal fungal diversity in ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The need often arises to appraise soils for agricultural or
   environmental uses. Field evaluation of parameters can give timely
   information about soil quality, often at a fraction of the cost of
   laboratory analysis. The specific gravity (SG) of a saturated paste
   (sat. paste) made on-site can be measured using a portable mud balance.
   For 71 soils from western Canada, the sat. paste SG was correlated with
   the saturation percentage (\% sat.), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and
   organic matter content (\% OM). Empirical power functions of the SG
   matched data for each of these parameters. The empirical SG function for
   \% sat. corresponded with published data for soils from the western
   United States as well. Values of SG in the range 1.0 to 2.1 thus
   indicated \% sat. values ranging from 20 to 400 (with r(2) = 0.97), CEC
   from 4 to 100 cmolc kg(-1) (r(2) = 0.72), and OM from < 1 to 50\% (r(2)
   = 0.80). On appropriate soils, estimates of these parameters calculated
   from the SG of a sat. paste could therefore be used, together with a
   hand-texture assessment, for field appraisal of items such as site
   remediability, sensitivity to contamination and crop production
   potential.}},

Abstract = {{Capturing in a database, differences in near surface soil properties
   (or. quality) that are affected by use and management, for improving
   soil survey interpretations is needed. Easy to use, low cost, on-site
   measurements are needed to populate such a database. The objectives of
   this study were to evaluate on-site tests for their ability to detect
   differences in near surface soil properties as affected by long-term
   land use in Michigan. The comparisons were between forest and cropland;
   and within cropland, between contrasting management-long-term no-till
   (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) systems. The on-site tests measured
   were soil respiration, infiltration rate, bulk density, soil water
   content, soil slaking, aggregate stability, soil pH, electrical
   conductivity (EC) of 1:1 soil-water mixture, and soil nitrates. On-site
   tests for bulk density, aggregate stability, slake test, and soil pH
   were able to detect significant differences between long-term CT and NT
   in cropland and between cropland and forest land. When differences were
   large as between forest and cropland, differences in soil nitrates,
   infiltration rate, and water content were significant. Bulk density,
   aggregate stability, resistance to slaking, and soil pH show promise as
   indicators of land use history, that could be used to estimate property
   ranges in a use-dependant soils database.}},

Abstract = {{Dairy manure, as a passive by-product of livestock, is an important
   source of nutrients and organic matter to soils that support forage
   production. A split-plot experiment was conducted to determine the
   long-term (19941999) effects of dairy manure and chemical fertilizer on
   soil quality properties and carbon (C) sequestration in an alfalfa
   (Medicago sativa L.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) forage
   systems. Five years after initiation of the experiment, soil core
   samples were collected randomly from between the alfalfa-orchardgrass
   rows under different treatments and analyzed or incubated to determine
   selected soil biological, chemical and physical properties. Results show
   that long-term application of dairy manure slurries significantly
   increased total organic, microbial biomass, potentially mineralizable,
   extractable and labile C pools, respectively, and improved soil
   aggregate stability by associated decrease in specific maintenance
   respiration rates, and subsequently enhanced soil quality. Relatively
   smaller amounts of total, microbial biomass, extractable and labile C
   pools with an increase in specific maintenance respiration rates, and
   increase in soil acidity accompanied by a decrease in aggregate
   stability suggest that long-term and continuous use of inorganic
   fertilizers for forage production did not improve soil quality or
   enhance C sequestration. The continuous cover of forage species,
   especially alfalfa, significantly improved soil quality over time as
   compared to orchardgrass species. The beneficial effects of organic
   amendments are important for proper disposal and utilization of dairy
   manures in forage production systems with an accompanied improvement in
   soil quality and C sequestration.}},

Abstract = {{Cultivation can reduce soil organic carbon (SOC) content and lead to
   soil deterioration, but some agricultural management systems may
   increase SOC content and soil productivity. This research examined the
   SOC dynamics during a 50-year cultivation and how long-term agricultural
   management practices influenced SOC content in a typical black soil
   (Mollisol) region of P.R. China. The experiments selected four areas
   with different cultivation periods: uncultivated, five years, fourteen
   years, and fifty years. In addition, four long-term agricultural
   managements were initiated in 1992: conventional wheat-soybean rotation,
   wheat-sweet clover rotation, wheat-soybean rotation with addition of pig
   manure, and wheat-soybean rotation with addition of wheat straw. The SOC
   content declined rapidly at early years of cultivation and gradually
   afterwards. Wheat-soybean rotation with addition of wheat straw or pig
   manure resulted in a substantial increase in SOC content in 9 years.
   Thus, proper soil management can improve soil quality and health by
   increasing SOM content, and mitigate the greenhouse effect by
   sequestrating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as indicated by the
   significant increase of organic carbon content in soil.}},

Abstract = {{Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of irrigation
   with treated wastewater on soil fertility and chemical characteristics.
   Three field experiments were conducted at a farmer's field near Ramtha
   Wastewater Treatment Plant. Corn (Zea mays) was planted for two seasons
   as a summer crop while vetch (Vicia sativa) for one season as a winter
   crop.
   Plots were irrigated with either potable water (PW) or wastewater (WW)
   in amount according to the following treatments: i) potable water
   equivalent to 100\% class A pan reading (PW); ii) wastewater equivalent
   to 100\% class A pan reading (WW1); iii) PW with application fertilizer
   equivalent to N and P content of WW (PWF) and iv) wastewater equivalent
   to 125\% class A pan reading (WW2). Treatments were replicated 4 times
   in a randomized complete block design. Soil samples were taken before
   and at the end of the growing season and were analyzed for soil
   parameters. WW samples were taken and analyzed periodically for major
   characteristics. WW analysis indicates inefficient treatment and high
   values of Biological Oxygen Demand, salt content and reduced form of
   nitrogen. The results of the field experiments indicate that WW
   irrigation decreased soil pH and increased soil salinity, soil
   phosphorus (P), potassium (K), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) levels.
   Soil organic matter increased only in the topsoil and by the highest
   rate of WW irrigation. This effect could be attributed either directly
   through the addition of the nutrients and organic compounds to the soil
   or indirectly through enhancing solubility of soil nutrients. Soil zinc
   (Zn) and copper (Cu) were not significantly affected by WW irrigation.
   It can be concluded that secondary treated WW can improve soil fertility
   parameters, however, more efficient treatment is recommended to reduce
   salt content. In addition, proper irrigation management and periodic
   monitoring of soil quality parameters are required to minimize adverse
   effect on the soil.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, the only reliable way of doing (12)C-(13)C analysis was
   using a mass spectrometer. For many developing countries, the high
   initial cost and running costs of a mass spectrometer precluded the
   purchase of such an instrument. Recent developments in optical systems
   have provided a robust, low-cost option for undertaking (13)C analysis.
   Although these machines were initially developed for breath testing for
   Helicobacter pylori, they have an enormous potential as a research tool
   for soil science. The relatively low cost of the equipment at
   US\$15,000-25,000 is within the research budgets of most institutes or
   universities. The simplicity of the mechanisms and optical nature mean
   that the equipment requires relatively low maintenance and minimal
   training.
   (13)C may be used to study numerous areas including: organic matter
   turnover, shifts in delta (13)C from C4 to C3 vegetation, organic matter
   residence times, determination of sources of stable organic matter,
   delta (13)C differences in drought and salt tolerant isolines, root
   turnover, soil respiration, the breakdown of different pesticides in the
   soil, soil respiration as an indicator of soil quality and
   mineralization.
   The data presented will describe the preparation methods of soil and
   plant materials for analysis using the breath test analyzer. These will
   include testing the system at natural abundance level and for enriched
   samples.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural carbon (C) sequestration may be one of the most cost
   effective ways to slow processes of global warming. Numerous
   environmental benefits may result from agricultural activities that
   sequester soil C and contribute to environmental security. As part of
   no-regret strategies, practices that sequester soil C help reduce soil
   erosion and improve water quality and are consistent with more
   sustainable and less chemically dependent agriculture. While we learn
   more about soil C storage and its central role in direct environmental
   benefits, we must understand the secondary environmental benefits and
   what they mean to production agriculture. Increasing soil C storage can
   increase infiltration, increase fertility and nutrient cycling, decrease
   wind and water erosion, minimize compaction, enhance water quality,
   decrease C emissions, impede pesticide movement and generally enhance
   environmental quality. The sum of each individual benefit adds to a
   total package with major significance on a global scale. Incorporating C
   storage in conservation planning demonstrates concern for our global
   resources and presents a positive role for soil C that will have a major
   impact on our future quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation agriculture is a new form of farming with emphasis on
   preserving the soil and water resources of the farmland while
   maintaining sustainable crop production with increased yields. It is
   achieved with minimal soil disturbance and managing crop residues to
   protect the soil from wind and water erosion and to enhance soil
   quality. With the world's limited farmland resources, there is urgency
   to perfect and adopt this new farming system.
   While conservation agriculture is a significant enhancement to modern
   farming, it also poses serious challenges to the mechanization of the
   required processes and functions. Large-scale agriculture is conducted
   with highly mechanized farming machines and tractors. Many of these
   machines were designed for optimal performance under traditional clean
   tilled farm fields. They often do not perform as designed when applied
   to conservation farming fields where tillage is minimal and crop
   residues are maintained over,the soil surface, thus requiring
   modifications or replacement.
   A wide variety of farming equipment has been developed or adapted for
   conservation farming in large scale, mechanized agriculture. Major
   equipment includes that used to: seed, harvest, fertilize, control weeds
   and pests, and manage soil conditions. The principle reason for many
   equipment changes has been the omission of significant soil tillage, but
   this is the most important change needed to conserve the farmland soil
   and water resources.
   While conservation agriculture has required significant changes in
   large-farm mechanization, more innovation is yet required to achieve the
   perceived goals. These changes have already increased the precision of
   the farming processes, reduced the time and energy required per unit of
   farmed land, and resulted in significant improvement in the preservation
   of agricultural natural resources.}},

Abstract = {{An increase in atmospheric concentration of CO(2) from 280 ppmv in 1750
   to 367 ppmv in 1999 is attributed to emissions from fossil fuel
   combustion estimated at 270 +/- 30 Pg C and land use change at 136 +/-
   55 Pg. Of the emissions from land use change, 78 +/- 12 Pg is estimated
   from depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. Most agricultural
   soils have lost 50 to 70\% of their original SOC pool, and the depletion
   is exacerbated by further soil degradation and desertification. The
   restoration of degraded soils, conversion of agriculturally marginal
   lands to appropriate land use, and the adoption of recommended
   management practices on agricultural soils can reverse degradative
   trends and lead to SOC sequestration. Technological options for SOC
   sequestration on agricultural soils include adoption of conservation
   tillage, use of manures, and compost as per integrated nutrient
   management and precision fanning strategies, conversion of monoculture
   to complex diverse cropping systems, meadow-based rotations and winter
   cover crops, and establishing perennial vegetation on contours and steep
   slopes. The global potential of SOC sequestration and restoration of
   degraded/desertified soils is estimated at 0.6 to 1.2 Pg C/y for about
   50 years with a cumulative sink capacity of 30 to 60 Pg. The SOC
   sequestration is a cost-effective strategy of mitigating the climate
   change during the first 2 to 3 decades of the 21(st) century. While
   improving soil quality, biomass productivity and enhanced environment
   quality, the strategy of SOC sequestration also buys us time during
   which the non-carbon fuel alternatives can take effect.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) from agriculture is related
   to increasing and protecting soil organic matter (SOM) concentration.
   Agricultural soils can be a significant sink for atmospheric carbon (C)
   through increase of the SOM concentration. The natural ecosystems such
   as forests or prairies, where C gains are in equilibrium with losses,
   lose a large fraction of the antecedent C pool upon conversion to
   agricultural ecosystems. Adoption of recommended management practices
   (RMPs) can enhance the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool to fill the large
   C sink capacity on the world's agricultural soils. This article
   collates, reviews, and synthesizes the available information on SOC
   sequestration by RMPs, with specific references to crop rotations and
   tillage practices, cover crops, ley farming and agroforestry, use of
   manure and biosolids, N fertilization, and precision farming and
   irrigation. There is a strong interaction among RMPs with regards to
   their effect on SOC concentration and soil quality. The new equilibrium
   SOC level may be achieved over 25 to 50 years. While RMPs are being
   adapted in developed economies, there is an urgent need to encourage
   their adoption in developing countries. In addition to enhancing SOC
   concentration, adoption of RMPs also increases agronomic yield. Thus,
   key to enhancing soil quality and achieving food security lies in
   managing agricultural ecosystems using ecological principles which lead
   to enhancement of SOC pool and sustainable management of soil and water
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{The mountain acid soils of the Western Himalayas, in India, occupy about
   0.1 million ha that are characterized by features such as marginality,
   inaccessibility and fragility where cereals, pulses, oilseeds,
   vegetables, and fruit crops are grown for the nutritional security of
   small and marginal farmers. And yet the productivity of the crops is
   poor; for example, wheat at 1.5 tonnes/ha, rice 1.2 tonnes/ha, and maize
   2 tonnes/ha.
   Among the soil fertility constraints responsible for low productivity of
   crops, the dominant ones are: phosphorus (P) deficiency, its poor
   availability to crops coupled with low P use efficiency and high P
   fixation. Consequently, to overcome some of these problems; many African
   phosphate rocks (PRs) with high content of citrate-soluble P are
   entering the Indian market under liberalization program because Indian
   PRs have less citrate-soluble P than the African ones. In this
   background, the African PRs could prove economically better compared
   with Indian PRs, if they demonstrate agronomic effectiveness and
   improvement in soil properties.
   Long-term field experiments were, therefore, conducted to study the
   comparative agronomic effectiveness of African and Indian PRs in
   relation to productivity of maize and wheat crops in mountain acid soils
   of the Western Himalayas (India) with effect from 1994 to 1999.
   Phosphorus at 500 kg P2O5/ha was applied once at the start of the trial
   to 10 crops (5 maize and 5 wheat) in the form of three African PRs
   {[}Tebessa, Youssofia, and Gafsa (30\% P2O5)] and one Indian PR,
   Mussoorie PR (18\% P2O5). Single superphosphate (SSP) was applied each
   season for each crop of maize and wheat at 50 kg P2O5/ha for 5 years.
   The results suggested that a one-time application of P for 5 years at
   500 kg/ha as Tebessa, Gafsa, and Youssofia has had a significant effect
   in improving the average productivity of maize giving an average yield
   of 4.63, 4.78, and 4.64 tonnes/ha, which was 49.8\%, 54.7\%, and 50.2\%
   greater than control. The three PRs did not differ significantly among
   themselves. However, the Indian Mussoorie PR recorded a comparatively
   lower yield of 4.22 tonnes/ha than did the African PRs though
   significantly greater than the control (36.6\%).
   If the African PRs along with Indian Mussoorie PR axe compared with
   direct application of P as SSP, the performance of SSP in terms of grain
   yield and P uptake was significantly better than all the PRs.
   As for the wheat crop, it was found that the average grain
   productivities, on a one-time application of African PRs at 500 kg
   P2O5/ha applied as Tebessa, Gafsa, Youssofia, and also Indian PR were
   54.1\%; 39.8\%, 50.8\%, and 39.8\% greater than the control and that the
   trend of P uptake was also of similar nature. The attainment of average
   grain productivity of wheat following application of P each season for 5
   years at 50 kg P2O5/ha as SSP was maximum (61.4\%), and the same was
   true for P uptake by wheat. The relative performances of the phosphorus
   sources on the productivity of crops were:
   Maize: SSP > Gafsa = Youssofia = Tebessa > Mussoorie
   Wheat: SSP > Tebessa = Youssofia > Gafsa = Mussoorie.
   Further, there was an immense improvement in soil quality in terms of
   amelioration of soil characteristics that are often associated with the
   availability of P from PRs such as soil pH, organic C, exchangeable Ca,
   Al, acidity, effective CEC, pH, buffer capacity, extractable Al and P
   fixing capacity. The monetary benefits accrued were of greater magnitude
   in respect of African PRs compared with SSP.}},

   useful measurements only at the 0similar to20 cm interval due to the
   fact that the thermal inertia method is built mainly on the difference
   in daily temperature, part of whose patterns are limited largely to soil
   surface level without attacking its depth. The paper makes an approach
   to the problem, proposing a scheme and a model for estimating soil
   moisture at depth from NOAA/AVHRR sensings, based upon the apparent
   thermal inertia (ATI) and the aid of Geographic Information System
   (GIS), and with the effect of soil quality allowed for. Evidence
   suggests a rather high nonlinear relationship between the surface and
   deep levels of soil and its model is in the form S = A x (d - d(0)) +
   S-0 x {[}1 + B x (d - d(0))(2)] + S-c, with which to estimate the water
   at depth by means of remotely sensed top-level moisture. As demonstrated
   in the practical applications to moisture sensing on a long-term and a
   multi-temporal phase basis in Henan Province, the developed model raises
   the mean accuracy by 5.5\%similar to8.1\% compared to the direct
   monitoring from satellite sensings of soil moisture at depth. On the
   other hand, owing to the limitation to the data of deep level moisture
   the water conditions at depth retrieved from the presented method and
   the developed model do not exceed 100 cm. And on land just irrigated or
   after rain the precision would be affected to noticeable degree because
   of the nonlinear relation available no longer.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with soil quality assessment and evaluation of soil
   functions. Because of numerous potential land uses, it is not possible
   to evaluate soil quality by an only index for all recent and future land
   uses. Soil quality assessment thus has to be related to particular
   recent or planned future land use. Nevertheless, partial soil functions
   can be evaluated alone and then score values of the most important
   functions can be combined into soil quality index. In this study we
   attempt to describe and quantify the capability of soil to function as a
   filter in the cycle of specific organic pollutants. The basis of the
   approach is comprehension and numerical expression of key physical and
   chemical processes which account for soil filtration function. Relevant
   processes were described using soil and environmental indicators.
   Minimum data set of indicators used for evaluation included quantity and
   quality of soil organic matter, humus layer thickness, clay content and
   soil thickness as soil quality indicators and precipitation as an
   environmental factor. As a demonstration of practical application, data
   from existing database of selected soil profiles of Complex Soil Survey
   in the Slovak Republic were used for calculation of a filtration
   capability score. Indicators were transformed and normalized by soil
   scoring functions, combined into equation for score of filtration
   capability and five categories of filtration capability were set up. The
   map of categories of the soil filtration capability in the Slovak
   Republic was processed using methods of spatial statistics.}},

   Soil quality deterioration is expressed by decrease in acid buffering
   capacity of soils during acidification and sometimes by decrease in base
   buffering capacity after extreme liming of soils. Improvement of soil
   quality is represented by increase in total buffering capacity of soils
   during both soil acidification and soil liming. The lowest soil
   buffering capacity was found for sandy acid regosols, whilst the soil
   buffering capacity was 20 times higher for calcaric varietes of various

Abstract = {{This study examines the potential for environmental risks due to organic
   contaminants at sewage sludge application sites, and documents metals
   and various potential organic contaminants (volatile organics,
   chlorinated pesticides, PCBs, dioxins/furans, extractable petroleum
   hydrocarbons, PAHs, phenols, and others) in current production biosolids
   from five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) within the Greater
   Vancouver Regional District (GVRD). There has been greater focus in
   Europe, North America and elsewhere on metals accumulation in
   biosolids-amended soil than on organic substances, with the exception of
   polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans.
   Another objective, therefore, was to evaluate the extent to which
   management of biosolids re-use based on metal/metalloid levels
   coincidentally minimizes environmental risks from organic contaminants.
   Historical-use contaminants Such as chlorophenols, PCBs, and chlorinated
   pesticides were not detected at environmentally relevant concentrations
   in any of the 36 fresh biosolids samples, and appear to have virtually
   eliminated from sanitary collection system inputs. The few organic
   contaminants found in freshly produced biosolids samples that exhibited
   high concentrations relative to British Columbia and Canadian soil
   quality benchmarks included p-cresol, phenol, phenanthrene, pyrene,
   naphthalene, and heavy extractable petroleum hydrocarbons
   (HEPHs-nCl9-C34 effective carbon chain length). It was concluded that,
   with the exception of these petroleum hydrocarbon constituents or their
   microbial metabolites, the mixing of biosolids with uncontaminated soils
   during land application and based on the known metal concentrations in
   biosolids from the Greater Vancouver WWTPs investigated provides
   adequate protection against the environmental risks associated with
   organic substances such as dioxins and furans, phthalate esters. or
   volatile organics. Unlike many other organic contaminants, the
   concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbon derived substances in biosolids
   has not decreased within the last decade or more in the WWTPs studied,
   and-unlike persistent chlorinated compounds-the associated PAHs and
   other hydrocarbon constituents merit careful consideration, especially
   in the context of repeated land-application of biosolids.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{371-374}},
Abstract = {{Currently, soil quality criteria or soil risk assessments of metals are
   based on laboratory toxicity tests which Lire carried out ill soils
   freshly spiked with metal salts. With these data, species sensitivity
   distributions are fitted, from which hazardous concentrations and
   predicted no effect concentrations are derived. However, due to
   long-term processes, called ageing, soil metal availability decreases
   with time. Here we show that pH is the most important parameter
   determining the effect of ageing on zinc partitioning ill soils, with
   the effect of ageing becoming more important with increasing pH.
   Furthermore, zinc bioavailability, expressed as the internal zinc
   concentrations in red clover (Trifolium pratense) is closely related to
   pore water zinc concentration. In addition, there is a clear
   dose-response relationship between the survival of the earthworm Eisenia
   fetida and the calcium chloride-extracted zinc fraction. These results
   indicate that zinc partitioning can be used to predict zinc
   bioavailability to terrestrial organisms. However, the use of spiked
   soils in toxicity assays can result in an over-estimation of the effects
   of zinc, especially at a high pH. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of heavy metal additions in past sewage sludge applications
   on soil metal availability and the growth and yield of crops was
   evaluated at two sites in the UK. At Gleadthorpe, sewage sludges
   enriched with salts of zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) had been
   applied to a loamy sand in 1982 and additionally naturally contaminated
   Zn and Cu sludge cakes in 1986. At Rosemaund, sewage sludges naturally
   contaminated with Zn, Cu, Ni and chromium (Cr) had been applied in
   1968-1971 to a sandy loam. From 1994 to 1997, the yields of both cereals
   and legumes at Gleadthorpe were up to 3 t/ha lower than the no-sludge
   control where total topsoil Zn and Cu concentrations exceeded 200 and
   120 mg/kg, respectively, but only when topsoil ammonium nitrate
   extractable metal levels also exceeded 40 mg/kg Zn and 0.9 mg/kg Cu. At
   Rosemaund, yields were only decreased where total topsoil Cu
   concentrations exceeded 220 mg/kg or 0.7 mg/kg ammonium nitrate
   extractable Cu. These results demonstrate the importance of measuring
   extractable as well as total heavy metal concentrations in topsoils when
   assessing likely effects on plant yields and metal uptakes, and setting
   soil quality criteria. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Determining how environmentally important trace metals are sequestered
   in soils at the molecular scale is critical to developing a solid
   scientific basis for maintaining soil quality and formulating effective
   remediation strategies. The speciation of Zn and Ni in ferromanganese
   nodules from loess soils of the Mississippi Basin was determined by a
   synergistic use of three noninvasive synchrotron-based techniques: X-ray
   microfluorescence (muXRF), X-ray microdiffraction (muXRD), and extended
   X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS). We show that Ni is
   distributed between goethite (alpha-FeOOH) and the manganese oxide
   lithiophorite, whereas Zn is bound to goethite lithiophorite,
   phyllosilicates, and the manganese oxide birnessite. The selective
   association of Ni with only iron and manganese oxides is an explanation
   for its higher partitioning in nodules over the soil clay matrix
   reported from soils worldwide. This could also explain the observed
   enrichment of Ni in oceanic manganese nodules. The combination of these
   three techniques provides a new method for determining trace metal
   speciation in both natural and contaminated environmental materials.}},

Abstract = {{This paper briefly reviews the pressures on forest soils as essential
   parts of forest ecosystems, and the services expected of them. It
   reports the use of soil quality indicators in forestry world-wide, and
   makes recommendations for the utilization of direct and indirect

   for use in a forestry context in the UK. It reviews the degree of forest
   soil monitoring in Great Britain, and the problems posed by spatial and

   basis and biotope for men, animals, plants and soil organisms.
   Ecotoxicological test methods are used as tools for the hazard
   assessment of chemical properties or the characterization of the
   contaminated soil with respect to its functions. The importance of soil
   organisms for the functions of the soil has been identified and
   described sufficiently in literature and is only summarized shortly. The
   structure and the work programme of the International Organization for
   Standardization (ISO) with respect to soil quality testing is described.
   The state of standardization focussing on tests using soil organisms and
   the recent ISO activities concerning the development of new approaches
   in soil quality testing are reviewed. As many of the existing test
   methods have been developed for chemical testing the existing methods
   need to be adapted and optimised. As an example, experiences gained with
   the ISO `'Higher plant growth test'' in validation experiments are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Ornamental plant production in Croatia has an eighty-year-old tradition.
   Majority of production is located along Adriatic coast and inland, near
   bigger cities. Climatological conditions are under the influence of both
   the sea and continental air masses. Croatia mostly has a good water and
   soil quality as well as developed transport and communication system.
   After the Second World War, ornamental plant production was mainly
   organized on big scale companies, owned by the state. Starting from the
   nineties the production moved on private, family farms. Today,
   production of ornamental plants is mainly executed under protected
   environment while the production of ornamental trees, shrubs and rose
   seedlings is organized outdoors. Primarily grown are cut flowers,
   especially chrysanthemums, carnations, roses, gerberas, and bedding
   plants. Currently, Croatia is oriented on the import of ornamental
   plants; in the last eight years Croatia has imported ornamental plants
   in total value of 110.8 million USD. Data on import of ornamental plants
   is showing that there is marketing niche for this sort of product. At
   present, Croatia has 62 ha of undercover production area, mostly without
   modern equipment. The ornamental plant production is suffering from lack
   of investment in the new technologies and there is no serious and
   systematic approach of state policy to this segment of agricultural
   production.}},

Abstract = {{Although the effect of increased CO2 levels on global climate is
   uncertain, however, many scientists agree that a doubling of atmospheric
   CO2 concentrations could have serious environmental consequences. Three
   basic approaches are: 1) use energy more efficiently to reduce our need
   for a major energy and carbon source-fossil fuel combustion, 2) use of
   low-carbon and carbon-free fuels and technologies (nuclear power and
   renewable sources such as solar energy, wind power, and biomass fuels),
   3) capture and store carbon emitted from the global energy system
   (carbon sequestration). The last one is truly radical in a technology
   context.
   The role of soil in the global carbon cycle is now widely recognised.
   The total amount of carbon stored in terrestrial environment is about
   2000 +/- 500 Pg and about 75\% of this occurs in the soil. The potential
   of carbon sequestration appears to be large (5-10 Pg/year) in comparison
   to current rate of release (2 Pg/year). In addition to restoration of
   degraded ecosystems, there are number of benefits for increased soil
   quality and crop production. Natural carbon fluxes are huge, so that
   even small forced changes in the natural balance would be very
   significant at global level. Reliable data shows that agriculture is a
   source of atmospheric CO2. About 30 to 50\% of soil organic matter has
   been lost since the cultivation of native prairies in Canada. However,
   CO2 lost through cultivation is approximately 7-10 times more than CO2
   released by fossil fuel combustion.
   It may seem unlikely to sequester large amounts of carbon in dryland
   areas, in comparison to other agro-ecological regions. Drylands store 60
   times more carbon than that of carbon added to the atmosphere by fossil
   fuel. Drylands cover 450 million ha area in the world. A small change in
   the rate of carbon sequestered in dryland regions can have large effect
   on CO2 concentration in the air. Most of the drylands of the world have
   been severely degraded and carbon sequestration could be very effective
   to restore soil quality in these regions. Uncultivated soils, in
   equilibrium with the native vegetation, accumulated large amounts of
   organic matter and cultivation has disrupted this steady state
   equilibrium. The lost carbon primarily should be returned to the soil.
   It is estimated that this will take 25-50 years, with current
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Soil damage and degradation due to irresponsible agricultural management
   is a serious threat to public health, therefore viable agricultural
   practices should be a priority in environmental policy. Food production,
   supply and access to resources are crucial issues, and, due to poor soil
   quality, food supply problems continue to affect many developing
   countries. But in developed countries also, ground and water
   contamination are growing concerns. Since soil pollution depends on
   complex interactions between soil constituents and pollutants, the
   evaluation of soil quality is a prerequisite for formulating
   international policy and legislation to limit contamination and restore
   quality. To prevent and remediate soil and groundwater pollution, to
   ensure the environmentally-friendly use of land and groundwater
   resources, to improve the living environment, and to enhance public
   health, governments, municipalities and local communities must
   co-operate on an international level. Furthermore, the protection of
   local farming communities, in all regions of the world, is essential for
   the maintenance of plant genetic diversity and for the prevention of
   further soil degradation. Technology and international co-operation
   guided by a globally agreed upon strategy and a unified biocentric
   vision are vital in this context. Bio-policy in government, education
   and the professional sector can broaden our horizons and infuse new
   thinking and criteria in society. For the reversal of negative trends to
   be effective and to avoid further catastrophe, environmental legislation
   has to be adopted in a universal manner. As clearly shown recently,
   environmental threats are not affected by national borders and political
   or religious differences. They can only be countered through
   multilateral co-operation and through biodiplomacy.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in soil quality and health has grown with awareness that soil
   is vital to life on earth both in production of food and fiber and
   global ecosystems function and environmental stability. Agriculture
   needs economic soil management practices that provide sufficient food
   and fiber yet maintain environmental stability, ecological integrity,
   and the quality of essential soil, water, and air resources. Our journey
   towards sustainable land management starts with identification of our
   final destination or goals, the strategies or course by which we will
   get there, and the indicators that we are going the right direction.
   Strategies for sustainable management include conserving soil organic
   matter, minimizing erosion, balancing production with environmental
   needs, and making better use of renewable resources. In this regard,
   soil health is a major indicator of sustainable management. Criteria for
   indicators of soil health relate mainly to their utility in defining
   ecosystem processes and integrating physical, chemical, and biological
   properties; their sensitivity to management and climatic variations; and
   their accessibility and utility to agricultural specialists, producers,
   conservationists, and policy makers. Although soils have inherent
   quality as related to their physical, chemical, and biological
   properties within climate and ecosystem boundaries, the ultimate
   determinant of soil quality and health is the land manager. As such, the
   assessment of soil quality or health, and direction of change with time,
   is the primary indicator of sustainable management and environmental
   remediation. Examples are given of approaches for assessing soil health
   to define the economic and environmental sustainability of land
   management practices and to `translate our science into practice'.}},

Abstract = {{Semiarid areas in Europe, as it happens to other similar zones in the
   rest of the world, are `facing many problems associated with agriculture
   and environment, including scarcity of water, urbanisation,
   salinization, soil erosion, soil pollution and desertification. A
   traditional primarily subsidence agricultural economy of the soil has
   given way to an export-driven one, based on large holdings where the
   primary concern is to obtain products for export at competitive prices.
   Those newly established cultivations, always using advanced plantation
   technologies, created new challenges regarding the use and management of
   soils under semiarid conditions.
   As the inadequate management results in the detriment of the soil
   quality and provokes serious disturbance of the environment, it is
   essential to conduct an evaluation of the soils prior to the land
   management planning. Finally, knowing those fatal environmental
   influences caused by mankind, new policy has to be generated in order to
   preserve the soil as a base to reduce environmental alteration and
   biodiversity.
   Six representative zones of the different soil managements and the
   edaphodiversity under semiarid conditions have been selected. Several
   physical and chemical analyses as well as the profile characteristics
   have been considered. Results showed that after some years using
   incorrect management, many soil and environmental problems might be
   restorable. For example, just to highlight a few of them, bad
   agricultural practice is termed ``secondary{''} or ``anthropic{''}
   salinization of the soil and leads to a decrease in productivity in the
   coming years. This is because halophytic vegetation invades and
   colonises the areas which were previously productive. These generally
   poorly evolved soils also show serious erosion problems, especially in
   abandoned areas. The petrocalcic horizon is also being broken down to a
   depth of half a metre and natural exits to the sea are being blocked by
   material added to the soil for new cultivations.}},

Abstract = {{A practical methodology for the evaluation of potential soil quality and
   land use impacts of large-scale industrial investments has been studied.
   For this purpose, generalized methodologies that are applicable to a
   variety of development projects are presented with the aid of a specific
   environmental impact assessment (EIA) study.
   The EIA study was carried out for the Sugozu Power Plant (SPP) currently
   under construction at the western part of the Iskenderun Bay in Eastern
   Mediterranean coast of Turkey. Within the scope of baseline studies
   during the EIA phase, the soil characteristics of the area located in
   the vicinity of the power plant were determined.
   The distribution and characteristics of main soil groups in the study
   area were determined with desktop, laboratory and field studies.
   Particularly focusing on seasonal wind and land use patterns, topsoil
   samples (0-30 cm) were taken from 22 different points within a predicted
   impact area (28,000 ha) surrounding the power plant site. Their physical
   and chemical properties were analyzed.
   Potential soil quality impacts of the SPP (e.g., acidification) were
   investigated by using qualitative and quantitative methods.
   Consequently, a series of mitigation measures were developed to protect
   soil and land resources, which include a prudent layout avoiding, lands
   with agricultural and landscape value. According to the analyses results
   and site surveys, a monitoring program is recommended for the stack gas
   emissions. In this regard, the areas that may require lime application
   to control acidification could be recognized.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of soil resources management highly depends on the
   quality of the data. The majority of the soil maps have been compiled
   when soil resources were almost exclusively handled as the medium for
   agricultural production. Our approach of using soil resources and
   maintaining soil quality has been changed in the last few decades.
   Stronger emphasis has been placed on the importance of soils in
   maintaining environmental quality. Meanwhile, the spatial and temporal
   variability of soils has gained greater appreciation as well. Due to
   these changes, many of our soil maps and databases have become outdated.
   Soil inventories are expensive, particularly when temporal variability
   of soil properties has to be recorded. New mapping approaches are
   desirable. The use of remotely sensed (RS) and digital terrain data
   within Geographic Information System (GIS) can provide alternative means
   for soil inventories.
   Many researchers have demonstrated that the integration of RS data - as
   an environmental variable - into prediction models always increases the
   overall accuracy of inter- and extrapolation procedures.
   The improvement and easy accessibility of GIS has assisted the spatial
   modeling of soil forming factors and provided a more quantitative method
   of soil characterization. Thus, digital terrain data provides one of the
   most promising data sources for soil-landscape modeling. This paper
   summarizes the use of the digital data sources in soil characterization.}},

Abstract = {{One of the characteristics of soils in Tatarstan is their low organic
   matter content. The decrease in soil organic matter is paralleled by
   declines in soil fertility. One method to reverse this degradation in
   soil quality is the addition of organic matter. The use of sewage sludge
   on soils intended for growing of plant seedlings provides an alternative
   for sewage sludge disposal. Therefore, the evaluation of the feasibility
   of using compost from the municipal sewage Sludge produced in Kazan for
   the soil restoration and growth of Pinus silvestris seedlings was
   carried out. The grey forest soil (Haplic Greyzem) was amended with
   compost at application rate 30, 60 and 90 Mg ha(-1) on a dry matter
   basis. Organic matter content increased with the increase in sludge
   amendment. The concentrations of individual heavy metal were below the
   current limits established for Russia and European countries. Sludge
   amendments enhanced the germination and the number of the seedlings and
   the increase were more obvious for the soil with highest sludge
   treatment. The application of composted sludge to soil was followed by
   the increase in microbial biomass and basal respiration.}},

Abstract = {{In the Maltese islands, soil is one of the most threatened natural
   resources, being continuously exposed to a multitude of climatic,
   environmental, and man-induced impacts. The changes in agricultural
   practices as well as increases in urban development have intensified
   environmental problems and have accentuated the pressures on
   agricultural land and fragile semi-natural ecosystems. Between 1956 and
   2001, the total agricultural land declined from 20,433 ha to 10,713 ha,
   however, during the same period, the irrigated land as a percentage of
   total agricultural land increased from 3.9\% to 10.7\%. The poor quality
   of irrigation water sources, and the supply of treated sewage effluent
   with a high level of salts, contribute to a significant salt input. The
   extent of salt-affected soils in the Maltese islands is not
   well-documented, however, field observations and technical reports
   indicate that soil salinity is a potential constraint for agricultural
   production. This article gives a comparative review of the salinity
   status of soils in three case study areas in Malta, the agricultural
   dryland at Ghammieri, the intensively cultivated irrigated valley of
   Pwales, and the agricultural land irrigated with treated sewage effluent
   of the Sant Antnin Sewage Treatment Plant in the South-East of Malta.
   This analysis is provided in the context of the environmental impact of
   irrigation on soil quality in the Maltese islands.}},

Abstract = {{Yard waste compost provides an organic amendment useful for improving
   soil structure and nutrient status. The activities of the enzymes
   hydrolyzing urea (urease) and sucrose (invertase) in the rhizosphere of
   potato plants were determined under field conditions. Soil urease and
   invertase activities were monitored in compost amended soil, grass
   buffer strips, and in adjacent bare soils during 35 d following soil
   treatment. Soil urease activity was increased by application of yard
   waste compost compared to untreated soil which provide evidence of
   increased soil microbial population following application of compost.
   Some transitional effects on urease activities were observed following
   Pyrethrins and Neemix-4E application, these effects were neither drastic
   nor prolonged enough to be considered deleterious to the soil
   microorganisms and their activities important to soil fertility. No
   relationship was found between invertase activity and the three
   management practices or soil organic matter content. It is, suggested
   that application of botanical insecticides like pyrethrins and Neemix-4E
   may be useful in delaying urea fertilizer mineralization to maintain N
   in a form less leachable, so that the duration of N availability to
   plants is prolonged. The present study may also provide information on
   urease activity as a sensitive bioindicator of soil quality that
   reflects the effects of land management on soil quality and may assist
   land managers in monitoring long-term productivity and sustainability of
   agricultural lands.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-three field sites in North Dakota, where highly erodible soil is
   placed under permanent vegetation in the U.S. Conservation Reserve
   Program (CRP) from five to eight years, were surveyed for the presence
   or absence of earthworms. Soils were sampled to determine chemical and
   physical properties, and soil cores were collected to estimate earthworm
   populations. Earthworm species identified at 12 CRP sites were
   Aporrectodea tuberculata (Eisen), Aporrectodea trapezoids (Duges),
   Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny), Dendrobaena octaedra (Savigny), and
   Lumbricus rubellus (Hoffmeister). Sites with earthworms were associated
   with organic matter levels of greater than 2.5\%. Sand content of the 11
   sites without earthworms averaged 67\% (+/-13), and the soil usually
   contained what appeared to be sharp shiny crystals or grains that might
   not be ideal for earthworm survival. Dendrobaena octaedra and Lumbricus
   rubellus were found at sites with the highest soil organic matter and
   nitrate-N levels plus low sand percent. Soil P, K, pH and EC levels were
   not related to the presence or absence of earthworms in these CRP sites.
   Total earthworm population estimates from five CRP sites averaged 6.3
   million ha(-1) (+/-4.7), with adults, juveniles, and cocoons at 0.6
   (+/-0.4), 4.5 (+/-3.1), and 1.2 (+/-2.0) million ha(-1), respectively.
   Earthworm populations along a 90-meter transect from the edge of the CRP
   field were similar when averaged over the five sites. An estimate of
   population at the other seven earthworm sites was not possible because
   environmental stress as earthworms tended to migrate only to areas in
   the field where taproot plant species were located. The presence of
   wetlands or tree habitat in these CRP fields could not be used as
   criteria for determining the presence of earthworms.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{87-116}},
Abstract = {{Enhancing the long-term sustainability in productivity of crops and
   cropping systems is directly related to maintenance of an adequate level
   of soil organic matter. Indian soils contain about 0.1 to 1\% organic
   carbon. The maintenance of soil organic matter in agricultural soils,
   particularly of semiarid and subtropical regions of India, is generally
   governed by annual temperature, precipitation and many interacting
   factors such as soil types, tillage, application of fertilizers, quality
   and quantity of organics returned to soil, and the method of residue
   management. In India most residues used are as feed and fuel and
   one-third of crop residues is used as a source of organic matter.
   Continuous use of the same crops in the cropping system, unbalanced and
   inappropriate use of chemical fertilizer, and minimum or no use of
   organic matter year after year are a major constraints to soil organic
   carbon accumulation. Alternate land use systems, viz., agroforestry,
   agro-horticultural, agro-pastoral, and agro-silvipasture are more
   effective for soil organic matter restoration than monocropping systems.
   The constraints for organic matter management are reviewed, possible
   solution are presented, and future research needed are outlined. (C)

Abstract = {{Extreme exploitation and maltreatment of land in a number of countries
   had devastating impacts on terrestrial ecosystems (i.e., loss of
   biodiversity of flora and fauna). Biodiversity became a political topic
   (UNEP, and Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) of the United
   Nations) decades ago and was recently linked to agricultural practices
   in general (OECD, FAO). A survey of reports on ``sustainable land
   use{''}, ``soil fertility{''}, and ``soil biodiversity{''} which are
   published by such organizations leave the impression that soil fertility
   is controlled by soil biodiversity. In essence this would mean that a
   low soil fertility occurs together with a decrease in soil biodiversity.
   Here is the point where assumptions and scientific evidence are far
   apart with respect to below-ground biodiversity. Because the current
   discussion propagates soil biodiversity as a soil quality indicator, it
   seems necessary to question this approach with respect to microbial
   biodiversity of soils. Biological soil functions such as the maintenance
   of soil fertility are based on the concerted action of soil organisms
   such as soil microflora and soil fauna. For both biological entities no
   specific soil functions can be assigned to species diversity per se.
   Since organic matter turnover and nutrient turnover are mainly dependent
   on the activity of the soil microbial biomass (bacteria and fungi), the
   present paper concentrates on this biological soil fraction.
   An attempt will be made to give an overview of the scientific background
   of soil microbial biodiversity. Interdependencies between the abiotic
   and biotic components will be described, together with the relationship
   between above-ground and below-ground biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Our life support systems are deteriorating, locally, globally. We have
   changed the atmosphere of our planet. In many regions soil erosion, soil
   quality, is catastrophic and with this, food security. Water quantity,
   quality, is a major problem in almost half the nations. Our energy
   systems dominated by use of oil, gas, coal are not sustainable and in
   many regions, the management of toxic wastes is disastrous. Our basic
   resources are derived from the Sun, the atmosphere, biosphere,
   hydrosphere and the outer 5-km of the solid Earth. We require a new
   effort to integrate knowledge to develop the needed technologies for the
   future 10 billion humans who will live with our planet. Earth sciences,
   Earth history, are at the foundation of such efforts.
   Observations on ocean floor processes show vast opportunities for the
   supply of energy and materials with minimal environmental perturbation.
   Today, the continental land surface is too valuable for many of these
   purposes. If one examines processes near the great ocean ridges at ocean
   hotspots, there is a vast potential for collecting almost all metals,
   ceramics, and of particular urgency, energy.
   Observations on the sea floor materials produced over the past decades
   clearly show the vast potential for mineral resources. It is interesting
   that the World watch Institute in their most recent ``State of the
   World, 2003{''} have a special chapter ``Scrapping mining dependence{''}
   and have also published a special report (paper 162, October 2002) on
   the Anatomy of Resource Wars. Their data on the misuse of land resources
   is alarming. Peter Rona has recently reviewed marine minerals for the
   21st century (Episodes 25:2-12, 2002) and has written a brief version in
   Science (299:673-674, 2003). The data are impressive and include almost
   all elements use by humans. Data on the elements in manganese nodules is
   very impressive as also recently reported for India by Mukhopadhyay,
   Iyer and Ghosh in Earth Science Reviews 60:67-130, 2003. The geothermal
   fluids associated with the cooling of magmas have vast potential for
   metal transport. We have recently shown that high temperature fluids
   rich in carbon dioxide also contain carbon monoxide, CO, which is a
   wonderful transport agent for metals like gold, platinum, nickel and
   precipitate these on cooling. The guide to the processes is the presence
   of thin films of graphite, normally with sulphides. And in most places,
   there is evidence for the role played by diverse microorganisms.
   Recently, Karthikeyan and Beveridge have described how certain biofilms
   can precipitate gold (Environmental Microbiology 4:667-675, 2002). Fyfe
   (Science 273:448, 1996) has reviewed the wide range of environments
   where microorganisms are common, even to depths of over 4 km at
   temperatures of 100degreesC. We cannot understand near surface
   geochemistry without understanding the role of microorganisms.
   The world needs new energy technologies. The sea floor rocks have vast
   potential for geothermal energy. As I have shown 100 km3 of rock at
   1000degreesC could provide our global energy needs. And hot geothermal
   fluids also contain hydrogen, the perfect mobile fuel. The literature on
   geothermal hydrogen is exploding but see an early review by Hawkes,
   Mining Engineering, June 1980, 671-675.
   We have also recently shown that with microorganisms, basalts can fix
   carbon dioxide with great efficiency. Why not put combustion gases
   underground (see Fyfe, Science, 1996).
   There is also vast potential for agricultural materials in ocean floor
   systems. These include: minerals with phosphorus, calcium, potassium and
   traces like molybdenum necessary for natural nitrogen fixation in soils.
   But recently there have been observations that fascinate me. The worst
   soils in the world in the world for food production are the mineral
   deficient laterites of many regions. Recent studies in Brazil on modem
   marine sediments from Guanabara Bay and Utuba Bay are of great interest
   (see Anais da Academia Brasileira. de Ciencias 73:121, 2001; 75:77,
   2003). First it is of great interest that the older sediments are
   dominated by illite vermiculite and smectite. In addition, the trace
   metal content and organic content increase with long exposure to marine
   fluids. Such observations raise a great question: Does rather short
   exposure to seawater delaterize soils and could such sediments be used
   as fertilizer materials in many old lateritic soils? Mineral fertilizers
   can be of long life, low pollution and can be economic.
   Another urgent topic in our world is the management of many types of
   wastes. Recently, we have shown that if arsenic-polluted water is
   filtered through powders of FeS (pyrrhotite) the arsenic is removed to
   acceptable levels. But where do you put the wastes?
   And another urgent question is, where is the best place on the planet to
   deposit nuclear wastes? The Japanese have considered ocean trenches and
   the British, ocean muds where the wastes can be higly dispersed. Near
   shore sites with high sedimentation rates could be of interest. Marine
   experts must consider such problems (see Fyfe, Engineering Geology
   52:159-161, 1999).
   Finally, I have a dream! When we consider situations like the Juan de
   Fuca ridge off the Pacific west coast, where sediments rapidly cover and
   insulate the very warm ridge basalts thermal gradients are very high.
   Could we produce an ocean resource ship, which could drill, produce
   geothermal energy, geothermal hydrogen, metals and return the processed
   fluids underground with zero pollution? Such technologies have been
   developed in the geothermal regions of New Zealand. Given the mass of
   west coast ridge hot rocks, the energy involved could supply the needs
   of the west coast of North America.
   As in many such examples the need is for clear, accurate, demonstration
   that it could work! And the economic analysis must be for decades,
   future generations, not just till the next election! All people should
   read the stimulating publication ``Earth Alert, the past, present and
   future of our planet{''}, published by the Geologists Association of
   London, 2000.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality can be defined as the capacity of a soil to function,
   whilst maintaining the environmental quality and promoting plant and
   animal health. It also refers to the capability of soil to function at
   present and in the future for an indefinite period of time. Soil quality
   is a basic concept in the sustainable management of any agricultural
   system aimed at producing, avoiding or reducing negative effects on the
   environment, preserving resources and saving energy on a medium- or
   long-term basis and its assessment might be considered a means for the
   evaluation of the environmental sustainability of agricultural systems.
   A study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the contribution of the
   introduction of organic farming system to the environmental
   sustainability of organic farming in Southern Italy, with the assessment
   of soil quality of conventionally and organically managed citrus
   orchards. The study was carried out by a field survey, based on a
   comparative approach at a regional basis and by a farm-level
   experimental trial. The results obtained indicate an increase of the
   soil quality on organically managed citrus orchards, thus indicating
   that the introduction of an organic farming management system may
   contribute to the increase of the environmental sustainability of citrus
   production in Southern Italy.}},

Abstract = {{Worms of the family Enchytraeidae (Oligochaeta, Annelida) are small,
   inconspicuous animals, which despite their important role in many
   ecosystems have been virtually neglected as test organisms until about
   15 years ago. They belong to the saprophagous soil mesofauna, living
   mainly in close contact with soil pore water. After it was recognised
   that they were highly sensitive to anthropogenic stress factors in field
   studies, a chronic laboratory test using artificial soil, the
   Enchytraeid Reproduction Test (ERT), was developed for testing of
   chemicals as well as for soil quality assessment. Having been validated
   nationally and internationally, the test is currently standardised as a
   guideline by ASTM, ISO and OECD. In addition, new methods with
   enchytraeids, such as the use of avoidance behaviour in screening tests
   and a terrestrial bioaccumulation test are under development. New
   research could attempt to reduce the high variability in test results as
   well as examine the influence of natural soil properties on the
   sensitivity of the worms towards anthropogenic stress factors. In this
   contribution the most important test methods for the assessment of
   single chemicals, as well as for potentially contaminated soils are
   presented. The insights gained so far prove that these animals can play
   an important role in terrestrial ecotoxicology.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality refers to the ability of a soil to perform functions
   critical to the ecosystem. Native prairies are renowned for the richness
   of their soils, which have excellent soil structure and are typically
   very high in organic content, nutrients, and microbial biomass. In this
   study, soils from the top 5 cm of 3 prairie restorations of varying ages
   and community structures were compared with a nearby undisturbed prairie
   remnant and an agricultural field in terms of soil physical, chemical,
   and microbial properties. Water-holding capacity, soil moisture, soil
   organic matter, organic carbon, organic nitrogen, organic sulfur, and
   viable microbial biomass were significantly greater in the prairie
   remnant, as well as in the 2 long-term (21 to 24 y) prairie
   restorations, compared with the agricultural field and the restoration
   that was begun more recently (7 y prior to sampling). Nitrate-nitrogen
   and soil bulk density were significantly greater in the agricultural and
   recent restoration sites. In most cases, the values for the soil quality
   indicators in the restoration sites were intermediate between those of
   the virgin prairie and the agricultural sites. Samples could be assigned

Abstract = {{Treatment and recycling of agricultural and agro-industrial wastes
   abundant in the Mediterranean regions may contribute significantly to
   soil quality and fertility, and enhance suppressiveness against soil
   borne diseases. Grape mark wastes (GM), spent mushroom substrate from
   the cultivation of Agaricus mushroom species (SMS) and
   residues/by-products from the olive oil extraction process (olive mill
   wastewaters-OMW, olive leaves-OL, olive press cake-OPC, and extracted
   olive press cake-EPC) were 14 composted in various mixtures. The C/N
   ratios of the original wastes ranged from 16.8 (SMS) to 70.5 (OPC). Nine
   composts were prepared either from the original waste materials or from
   1:1 dw/dw mixtures (GM; GM+EPC; SMS; SMS+EPC; SMS+OMW; OL; OL+EPC;
   OL+OMW; OL+OPC) through a composting process performed in static
   perimetrically insulated piles, for a period of three months. Their
   moisture was kept between 40-60\% of their water-holding capacity and
   turnings were performed at the end of each thermophilic phase. The
   phytotoxicity of the final products was determined.
   The degradation of fluorescein di-acetate and the CO2-C evolution were
   evaluated as estimates of the microbial activity during composting of
   the OL+OPC mixture and were shown to be related to temperature
   fluctuations in the compost piles, revealing greater values of
   fluorescein and CO2-C release at the higher temperatures of each turn
   (middle of thermophilic phases) compared to the end of each thermophilic
   phase. However, at the end of the last thermophilic phase the total
   microbial biomass was significantly greater than at the middle of this
   phase whereas, both fluorescein release and CO2-C evolution showed
   extremely low values. This indicates that the labile C substrate
   depletion in the final product results in reduced microbial activity,
   but this does not necessarily indicate a small size for the microbial
   population colonising the final compost products.
   Pot experiments, set up in order to investigate the nutritional effects
   of the composts on the growth of maize indicator plants showed that the
   spent mushroom compost mixtures resulted in the best plant growth,
   followed by the grape mark waste material, whereas the composts based
   solely on olive extraction by-products performed poorly. All composts
   however, showed disease suppressiveness effects against soil-borne
   pathogens of the genera Phytophthora and Fusarium.}},

Abstract = {{A long-term field experiment with barley crop was conducted in Santa
   Olalla (Toledo, Spain). The experiment was performed on plots in four
   blocks, applying different treatments of municipal waste compost at two
   rates (20 and 80 t ha(-1)), cow manure with 20 t ha-1, and a control in
   a single application to determine their effects on soil respiration,
   metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) and microbial biomass at the end of the
   yield. Residual effects of these treatments were studied to evaluate the
   potential effect of these organic amendment for restoring soil quality.
   After nine years, only the highest rate of municipal waste compost
   maintain greater microbial biomass and higher respiration rate, by
   29.7\% 103.1\%, respectively, with respect to the nonamended soil
   (control), which confirm the enhancement of the potential microorganisms
   activities and suggest a greater effect on soil restoration in
   comparison to lower rate of compost and cow manure. Metabolic quotients
   (qCO(2)) were greater in all organic treatments due to the higher
   microbial activities in amended soils as a direct consequence of carbon
   sources from organic residues for soil biota.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted at the Experimental Station of the Faculdade de
   Engenharia (UNESP), Ilha Solteira County, Mato Grosso do Sul State,
   Brazil, with the aim of evaluating chemical modifications in a Red
   Latosol under cerrado, subjected to different use and management
   systems. A completely randomized design with six treatments and 10
   replications was used. The treatments of use and management were:
   no-tillage with annual crops, conventional system with annual crops,
   minimum tillage with annual crops, native vegetation (cerrado), pasture,
   and rubber tree crop. The following chemical attributes were evaluated:
   extractable phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, pH in CaCl2,
   ECEC, sum of bases (S), exchangeable aluminum and organic matter at
   depths of 0.0-0.1; 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.4 m. No-tillage and minimum tillage
   system led to significant increases of organic matter, phosphorus,
   potassium, magnesium, and calcium in the soil. In relation to the other
   systems, the pH, ECEC, and sum of bases were also higher, while the
   aluminum content was lower in the soil. Pasture and rubber tree crop
   systems reduced the organic matter, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and
   calcium contents, pH, ECEC, sum of bases, and increased the aluminum
   content, compared to the native vegetation system. No tillage and
   minimum tillage systems entailed a better soil quality, since they did
   not only improve the chemical soil conditions, but also maintained the
   organic matter at similar levels as in the native vegetation system.}},

Abstract = {{The principal land characteristics that can be estimated by means of
   airphoto interpretation are bedrock type, landform, soil texture, site
   drainage conditions, susceptibility to flooding, and depth of
   unconsolidated materials over bedrock. In addition, the slope of the
   land surface can be estimated by airphoto interpretation and measured by
   phptpgrammetric methods. The aim of this paper is to show an
   experimental use of satellite images in determining soil quality
   affected by anthropic activities as rock crushing, or scarifying.
   Scarifying activities began, in Murgia area, Apulia Region (Italy), as
   land improvement for agriculture uses. Scarifying is defined as
   loosening (the surface of soil) by using an agricultural tool or a
   machine with prongs. This kind of activity is facilitated by the
   availability, on the market, of scarifying machines and the objective is
   to get a stratum of agriculture-useful loose material on the soil
   surface. Apulia Region. Government has permitted calcareous stone
   scarifying with Regional Law n.54 (August 31, 1981) according to
   National Law n.984 (Dicember 27,1977), that provides for encouraging to
   transform grazing in sown land in order to create new-possibility of
   forage production to increase zootecnical facilities. We have used
   ERS-2/SAR images as contribution in the process of soil
   characterization. The area we have considered is in Puglia Region and is
   subject to soil transformation due to rocks crushed on land for
   agricultural facilities. European Union, through the same Apulia Region
   Government, has renewed funds for the improvement of meadow and grazing
   for an overall surface of 2000 hectares. In this way it is clear to
   understand the importance of qualitative and quantitative evaluation of
   rock crushing or scarifying by using airphoto interpretation. We have
   evaluated the soil quality by introducing a multicriteria, analysis by
   using a qualitative and quantitative methodology, so that it will be
   possible to prevent damages on soil, sub-soil and hydrology. Decision
   analysis in Impact assessment is a set of procedures for analyzing
   complex decision problems. The strategy is to divide the decision
   problem into small, understandable parts; analyze each part; and
   integrate the parts in a logical manner to produce a meaningful
   solution. The terms multicriteria decision making (MCDM) and
   multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) are used interchangeably.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the effects of forage management on soil C cycling improves
   our understanding of greenhouse gas emissions, agronomic productivity,
   and changes in soil quality in pasture ecosystems. We evaluated the
   effects of N fertilization strategy (inorganic only, crimson clover
   {[}Trifolium incarnatum L.] cover crop plus inorganic, and broiler
   litter) and forage harvest strategy (unharvested, low and high grazing
   pressure, and bayed; representing a gradient from low to high
   utilization) on particulate organic C (POC), soil microbial biomass C
   (SMBC), and potential C mineralization (CMIN) during 4 yr on a
   previously eroded site dominated by Typic Kanhapludults. Accumulation of
   POC, SMBC, and CMIN with time was greatest at a depth of 0 to 2 cm and
   was not different among fertilization strategies., To a depth of 6 cm,
   POC accumulated at a rate of. 65 to 73 g m(-2) yr(-1) under unharvested
   or bayed strategies and at a rate of 136 to 144 g m(-2) yr(-1) under
   cattle grazing strategies. Accumulation rate of SMBC was also dependent
   upon forage utilization, averaging 5.1, 9.6, 11.9, and 7.4 g m(-2)
   yr(-1) under unharvested, low grazing pressure, high grazing pressure,
   and bayed strategies, respectively. The portion of total organic C as
   CMIN during 24 it increased from 16 g kg(-1) initially to 44 +/- 5 g
   kg(-1) (mean +/- standard deviation among 12 treatments) at the end of 4
   yr, without significant treatment effects. Particulate and
   biologically-active soil C pools increased under all forage management
   strategies, although cattle grazing imparted the greatest increase
   partly because of the return of feces to soil.}},

Abstract = {{The nutrients loading from agricultural and urban areas have increased
   nutrient concentrations, particularly phosphorus, at the Everglades
   National Park (ENP). The soils in the region are mainly crushed
   limestone with low water holding capacity, high permeability, low
   organic matter, and low fertility. The Everglades-Agro-Hydrology Model
   (EAHM) has been developed to evaluate the impact of agricultural
   practices on crop production, water balance and the fate and transport
   of nutrients and pesticides. Considering the poor soil quality, the
   model simulation test indicated that the application of 90 to 134
   T.ha(-1) of compost annually will result in an increase in soil-water
   content, crop yield, and reduced water seepage below the root zone, thus
   reducing the potential for nitrogen and Atrazine to leach into
   groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{The production-oriented agricultural system of Midwestern United States
   has caused environmental problems such as soil degradation and nonpoint
   source (NPS) pollution of water. Riparian buffers have been shown to
   reduce the impacts of NPS pollutants on stream water quality through the
   enhancement of riparian zone soil quality. The objective of this study
   was to compare soil-water infiltration in a Coland soil (fine-loamy,
   mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Endoaquoll) under multi-species
   riparian buffer vegetation with that of cultivated fields and a grazed
   pasture. Eight infiltration measurements were made, in each of six
   treatments. Bulk density, antecedent soil moisture, and particle size
   were also examined. The average 60-min cumulative infiltration was five
   times greater under the buffers than under the cultivated field and
   pasture. Cumulative infiltration in the multi-species riparian buffer
   was in the order of silver maple > grass filter > switchgrass.
   Cumulative infiltration did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) among
   corn and soybean crop fields and the pasture. Soil bulk densities under
   the multi-species buffer vegetation were significantly (P < 0.05)
   smaller than in the crop fields and the pasture. Other measured
   parameters did not show consistent trends. Thus, when using infiltration
   as an index, the established multi-species buffer vegetation seemed to
   improve soil quality after six years.}},

Abstract = {{We use household data from northeast China to examine the link between
   investment and land tenure insecurity induced by China's system of
   village-level land reallocation. We quantify expropriation risk using a
   hazard analysis of individual plot tenures and incorporate the predicted
   ``hazards of expropriation{''} into an empirical analysis of plot-level
   investment. Our focus is on organic fertilizer use, which has
   long-lasting benefits for soil quality. Although we find that higher
   expropriation risk significantly reduces application of organic
   fertilizer, a welfare analysis shows that guaranteeing land tenure in
   this part of China would yield only minimal efficiency gains.}},

Journal = {{BIOGEOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{A reduction in plant cover can lead to an increase in the erosion
   processes that diminish soil quality. Any rise in temperature resulting
   from predicted climate changes may aggravate this effect, particularly
   in semiarid Mediterranean areas. Bearing this in mind, the capacity of a
   soil to preserve organic matter becomes very important if the soil is to
   maintain its physical and chemical properties. Soil organic carbon and
   nitrogen changes were evaluated in a non-disturbed (with natural
   vegetation) and a disturbed (all vegetation manually clipped to ground
   level) pine system. Nine years after vegetation removal significant
   differences (p < 0.01) were found in the soil organic carbon content
   between plots (top 20 cm), but not in total nitrogen. In the disturbed
   plot 0.0232 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) of soil organic carbon were lost through
   erosion and 4.30 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) through mineralization. In the first 48
   months after vegetation removal the soil organic carbon content fell
   from 40.3 to 28.0 g kg(-1). In the last 60 months of the experiment the
   amount of organic carbon in the soil fell from 28.0 to 27.7 g kg(-1).
   This result was mainly attributable to the intense oxidization, which
   took place during the first 60 months, of organic matter linked to the
   coarse soil mineral fraction. Up to the 72(nd) month the losses by
   erosion were a total of 532.7 g, which rose to 1284.4 g by the end of
   the experiment (108 months). The effect of vegetation removal in a
   Mediterranean semiarid area leads to a rapid decline in the amount of
   organic carbon stored in the soil. Such perturbation is irreversible if
   left to nature.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of microbial properties was introduced to the soil monitoring
   program in the Czech Republic in 1999. Microbial biomass C and N, basal
   and substrate-induced respiration, N mineralization and potential
   nitrification were measured in 60 soil samples taken from 27 plots on
   grasslands and from 33 plots on arable soil in April, July and October
   1999. Relationships between abiotic and microbial parameters were
   clearer in grasslands than in arable soils. Amount of microbial biomass
   was mainly determined by concentration of soil organic matter. Microbial
   biomass had a strong positive influence on C and N mineralization. Six
   eco-physiological quotients (C-bio/C-org, N-bio/N-org, qCO(2):
   respirated CO2-C/C-bio, qN: N mineralization/N-bio, potential
   respiration/basal respiration, C-bio/N-bio) were calculated from basic
   microbial properties. They showed seasonal fluctuations and were
   significantly influenced by texture. Behaviour of the quotients
   N-bio/N-org and N-mineralization/N-bio showed the same pattern as the
   parallel carbon quotients.}},

Abstract = {{Direct seeding or no-till leaves the soil undisturbed, except where the
   seed is planted and the soil fertilized. It offers several advantages in
   small-grain cereal production, including reduction in labor and other
   operating costs, reduction of soil erosion, and improvement of soil
   quality. However, only about 10\% of small grains in the U.S.A., and 6\%
   of the small grains in the Pacific Northwest region of the U.S.A. are
   currently direct seeded. Root diseases are major constraints to adoption
   of direct seeding; they increase because of lack of tillage, increased
   crop residue left on the surface, and typically cooler and wetter soil
   conditions in the spring. This review covers some recent research on the
   four most important root diseases of cereals in the Pacific Northwest
   and their causal agents. These diseases are rhizoctonia root rot and
   bare patch {[}Rhizoctonia solani AG-8, Rhizoctonia oryzae], pythium
   damping-off and root rot {[}Pythium spp.], take-all {[}Gaeumannomyces
   tritici var. tritici], and fusarium, foot rot {[}Fusarium
   pseudograminearum and Fusarium culmorum] We discuss how these diseases
   are affected by direct seeding and the impact of management strategies,
   including crop rotation, residue management, control of inoculum from
   volunteers and weeds, fertilizer placement, genetic tolerance,
   biological control, development of natural suppressiveness, and
   prediction of risk through DNA-based detection methods.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to evaluate the spatial variability pattern of
   some soil quality parameters at landscape-scale, particularly soil
   microbial biomass-C (C-mic) and -N (N-mic), and soil microbial activity
   (respiration) as well as soil organic carbon (C-mic), and hot water
   extractable carbon (C-hwe) by multivariate analyses of variance and
   canonical discriminant analyses (CDA). The study area was the Trier
   region, Rhineland-Palatinate, which is characterized by a wide range of
   soil types developed from various parent materials. Additionally, the
   investigated fields differed in soil management intensity (conventional,
   integrated, organic farming) and crops grown. Within the whole study
   area CDA revealed a separation into three sub-areas. Within the
   sub-areas the soil quality parameters were significantly influenced by
   the soil management systems and the crops grown. Despite the spatial
   variability and the relationship to soil management, the contents of
   C-mic could be predicted by stepwise multiple linear regression models,
   both for arable and grassland soils. The explained variance for the
   regression models were 72 \% for arable soils and 63 \% for grassland
   soils, respectively. Regression models for predicting N-mic and
   microbial activity revealed an explained variance between 30 and 58 \%.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to investigate soil quality changes resulting

   2, 10, 20, 200 and 1000 mug g(-1) dry soil and 1, 5, 10, 100, 1000 mug
   g(-1) dry soil and for metalaxyl and mefenoxam its R-enantiomer,
   respectively. Microbial activity indices (available N, ammonification
   and nitrification rates, microbial population density and specific
   enzymatic systems) were the more sensitive indicators of change. The
   values of these indicators generally increased with the period of
   incubation and decreased or increased at high rates. Mefenoxam and
   metalaxyl and their major acid metabolites were toxic to soil
   microorganisms at high doses with 16 h-IC(50) values of 4500, 12,500,
   and 15,800 mug g(-1) soil (dry weight), respectively. Thus, their
   ranking in terms of acute toxic effects was in the order mefenoxam >
   metalaxyl > acid metabolite. Incorporation of the fungicides in soil
   resulted in increased ammonium and nitrate levels. These changes
   stimulated soil microbial activity as evidenced by increased
   ammonification and nitrification rates, increased total viable bacteria
   counts especially after short-term exposure. Of the enzyme activities
   studied, dehydrogenase activity was the most sensitive to fungicides.
   This sensitivity was more pronounced with metalaxyl on long-term
   exposure. In general, the stimulation of nitrogen transformation and
   bacterial density were more pronounced with mefenoxam. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In humid tropical agroecosysterns, maintenance of soil fertility is
   critical to sustainability, yet inputs of fossil-fuel fertilizer are
   beyond the economic means of many farmers. One economically viable
   alternative is to manage soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics by altering
   the composition and number of crop species. The objectives of this study
   were to determine long-term effects of crop-species composition and
   richness on indices of soil fertility, in comparison with forests, and
   to evaluate mechanisms of crop-species influence. Study plots were
   established in the diverse array of agroecosystems in Kerala, India,
   where agriculture has been documented for >4000 year. With 91 different
   crops in the region, analyses were simplified by categorizing crops by
   functional groups, based on life form, nutrient cycling traits, and
   phenology. Mono-, bi- and polycultures contained 1, 2 and >2 functional
   groups, respectively. A paired-plot design in which a monoculture or
   biculture was paired with a polyculture within a farm was used, such
   that climate, soil, ownership, and management were as similar as
   possible for a pair. Soil properties (total soil organic carbon (SOC),
   N, pH, bulk density) and crop structural attributes that had the
   potential to influence SOC stocks (basal area and frequency) were
   measured in 100 m(2) plots (n = 70 pairs) within 50 farms. Three plots
   in nearby forests provided a basis for comparison. Total SOC ranged from
   6 to 20 g kg(-1) (in coastal areas and uplands, respectively), compared
   to 34-60 g kg(-1) in nearby upland forests. Differences in total SOC
   between mono- and polycultures depended on identity of the functional
   group in the monoculture: SOC amounts were higher in polycultures if the
   monoculture in comparison was a palm (P = 0.02) or herbaceous annual (P
   = 0.001), but not if the monoculture was a deciduous tree. Total SOC was
   61\% lower in polycultures cultivated for 40-60 years than in nearby
   forests. Under some conditions, total SOC increased directly with basal
   area (BA), an index of shading, indicating that BA may be an important
   design element of agroecosystems. Modeling results indicated that
   differences in lignin content of crop inputs could influence SOM
   quantity and quality; hence, crop tissue-chemistry traits may also be
   important elements of design. These results from ancient, humid tropical
   agroecosystems suggest that for maintenance of long-term soil fertility,
   high species richness may not be as important as individual species
   traits that influence nutrient cycling. Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Particulate organic matter nitrogen (POM-N) was evaluated as an
   indicator of crop residue source ( pulse versus cereal) and residue
   management (no-tillage {[}NT], stubble burned {[}SB] or stubble mulched
   {[}SM]) on soil quality and subsequent crop productivity in a continuous
   cropping experiment in northern New South Wales ( NSW), Australia. The
   relative contributions to POM of pulse versus cereal, and shoots versus
   roots, were studied using in situ N-15 shoot labelling. Under NT, a
   greater proportion of organic N was found in POM-N > 250 mum (5.5\%
   versus 3.5\% {[}SM] and 2.7\% {[}SB]) and POM-N > 53 mum (10.3\% versus
   9.7\% {[}SM] and 8.7\% {[}SB]). Pulse residues ( particularly roots)
   contributed 2-7 times more N to POM and 20-4 times more N to non-POM-N
   than barley (N-15 data), but this increased contribution was not
   detectable with non-isotopic analysis. POM-N was sensitive to residue
   management, but was not a reliable measure of N inputs from pulse versus
   cereal residues, nor a useful tool for predicting subsequent crop N
   uptake.}},

Abstract = {{A national soil quality monitoring program was established in 1990 to
   address concerns that the quality of Canada's agricultural soils was in
   decline. The British Columbia benchmark site (01-BC) was established in
   1991 and is located on the Pelly soil series (Orthic Him \& Gleysol)
   supporting a com-forage-pasture rotation in the Lower Mainland,
   ecoregion. The objectives of this study were to report on the
   differences in: (1) the measured soil properties for the 5-yr period
   between baseline data collection in 1991 and resampling in 1996 and (2)
   the properties measured annually as indicators of soil compaction. A
   25-m x 25-m grid was used at the site to locate sampling points for bulk
   density and collecting soil samples of the Ap, BCg, and Cg horizons, as
   well as the measurement locations for saturated hydraulic conductivity
   and penetration resistance. A 5-yr interval sampling regime was used to
   sample the Ap, BCg, and Cg horizons and bulk density. Saturated
   hydraulic conductivity and penetration resistance were sampled annually
   from 1992 to 1998. Between 1991 and 1996 in the A horizons; pH,
   available P, C:N ratio and bulk density increased by 4.6, 7.8, 2.5, and
   8\%, respectively, and available K, total C and total N decreased by 21,
   16.5, and 18.3\%, respectively. In the BCg horizon, pH, available P and
   C:N ratio increased by 5, 126, and 8\%, respectively, and the available
   K and total N both decreased by 21\%. Bulk density remained unchanged.
   The assumption that the soil chemical properties in the Cg horizon would
   remain stable during the study period did not hold. The trends detected
   for the Cg horizon were similar to those measured for the upper two
   horizons. However, only the reductions in available K and total N and
   increases in C:N were significant. The changes in the soil physical
   properties measured at this site indicate that some soil compaction has
   occurred. Both bulk density at 20 cm and penetration resistance
   increased at all depths between 1994 and 1998, which coincided with the
   time period that grazing was included in the crop rotation. Field
   saturated hydraulic conductivity at 25 cm (Ap2 horizon), although highly
   variable from year to year also tended to be lower during the pasture
   rotation. The penetration resistance measurements, which detected
   changes at all depths, appeared to be a more sensitive indicator of soil
   compaction than either bulk density or field saturated hydraulic
   conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient fluxes were quantified in a chronosequence of three Douglas-fir
   stands in the Monts du Beaujolais (France). Measurements were taken for
   6 years. Current annual and seasonal budgets were calculated and budgets
   for three theoretical rotation lengths were simulated.
   Results showed that current budgets were negative for most elements in
   the young stand, but that the deficit decreased with stand age. The
   budgets were balanced or positive in the older stand. Element deficits
   in the young stand were related to biomass accumulation and to
   considerable losses in seepage waters. High nitrification levels related
   to past land uses were responsible for leaching losses of nitrates and
   cations. Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen was an additional constraint
   in this N-saturated ecosystem.
   Simulated element budgets showed that whole tree harvesting should not
   be prescribed in these stands. Even when stem-only harvesting was
   practised, the balancing of the nutrient budgets would require a
   rotation length between 100 and 120 years, which is both technically and
   economically unrealistic. Sustainable management of such high production
   Douglas-fir forests would require nutrient inputs from fertilisation to
   maintain soil quality and their capacity to produce biomass at high
   rates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal values of soil physical quality (SPQ) parameters for enhancing
   field-crop productivity while maintaining or improving environmental
   health are still largely unknown. We hypothesized that progress toward
   identifying optimal values for some SPQ parameters might be made by
   comparing parameters obtained from long-term conventional tillage
   cropping (CT), long-term no-tillage cropping (NT), and virgin woodlot
   (WL) treatments located on Fox sand (Psammentic Hapludalf), Guelph loam
   (Mollic Hapludalf), and Brookston clay loam (Typic Argiaquoll) soils.
   Undisturbed 100-mm diameter soil cores were collected from the 0-100-mm
   depth range and the SPQ parameters, organic carbon (OC), bulk density
   (1313), porosity (POR), air capacity (AC), field capacity (FC),
   permanent wilting point (PWP), and plant-available water capacity (PAWC)
   were determined using standard laboratory methods. Regardless of soil
   type, OC, POR, and AC were smaller by 12-74\% under NT and CT relative
   to WL, while BD was greater by 28-56\%. The FC, PWP, and PAWC parameters
   showed no consistent differences among WL, CT, and NT. There was no
   clear advantage of NT over CT or vice versa with respect to any of the
   parameters measured. The SPQ indicator parameters, OC, BD, AC, and PAWC,
   all fell within their established ``optimum{''} ranges or limits for the
   AIL management on the loam and clay loam soils. However, these
   parameters fell outside their optimum ranges for the NT and CT
   managements on these soils, as well as for all three managements on the
   sandy soil. The recently proposed guidelines, FC/POR = 0.66 and AC/POR =
   0.34, for ``ideal{''} storage capacity of soil water and soil air appear
   to be useful as additional indicators of good SPQ, given that they yield
   results consistent with existing guidelines, and they incorporate
   aspects of soil quality that are not included in other indicator
   parameters.

Abstract = {{Soil depletion and degradation have been increasingly recognized as
   important environmental issues in many parts of the world. Over the last
   decade a number of political and legislative measures have been
   introduced to encourage and enforce sustainable soil management in New
   Zealand. Application of the new legislation has highlighted gaps in our
   knowledge of soil quality and a lack of scientific methods to assess and
   monitor soil quality. This paper describes the legislative measures and
   outlines the scientific response to the needs of regulatory agencies
   responsible for maintaining environmental quality. The research
   recommended a set of indicators to assess soil quality. Each soil
   quality attribute has an associated ``target range{''} defining the
   acceptable value for the attribute. The paper also discusses the
   communication of results to end-users, including the development of a
   computerized assessment tool. The legislative measures and scientific
   response have fostered a closer relationship between the policy and
   science communities, leading to more well-focused research, but greater
   collaboration is still required.}},

Abstract = {{Surfactant soil washing can remove polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs) from contaminated soil, and the white rot fungus, Phanerochaete
   chrysosporium Burdsall in Burdsall \& Eslyn, can oxidize PAHs. The
   objective of this study was to develop a novel bioremediation technology
   using a combination of abiological surfactant soil washing followed by
   PAH biological oxidation in soil washwater using P. chrysosporium in a
   rotating biological contactor (RBC) reactor. Soil used for
   experimentation was an 11-month aged contaminated soil spiked with a
   total of nine PAHs: acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene,
   pyrene, chrysene, benzo(a)pyrene, dibenz(a-h)anthracene, and
   benzo(ghi)peryiene. After 11 months of aging, recovery percentages of
   high molecular weight PAHs {[}i.e., from chrysene to benzo(ghi)perylene]
   were greater than 86\%, while those of low molecular weight PAHs (i.e.,
   from acenaphthene to pyrene) were less than 19\%. Total removal
   efficiency for any of the nine PAHs was greater than 90\% using a
   combination of surfactant soil washing and P. chrysosporium oxidation of
   soil washwater in the RBC reactor when used in batch operation, and
   greater than 76\% when used in continuous operation. The treatment of
   PAH-contaminated soil using a combination of surfactant soil washing and
   subsequent PAH removal from the resultant washwater in an RBC reactor,
   in the presence of immobilized P. chrysosporium, permits (i) a rapid
   abiological cleanup of soil for compliance with relevant soil quality
   standards and (ii) PAH biological removal in soil washwater for
   compliance with aqueous discharge standards.}},

Abstract = {{New Zealand is a signatory to international conventions on environmental
   performance, and soil quality information is needed for reporting both
   at a national and regional level. Soil quality was measured at 222 sites
   in rive regions of New Zealand (12 soil orders and 9 land-use
   categories). Topsoil (0-100 mm) properties measured were total carbon
   and nitrogen, potentially mineralizable N, pH, Olsen P, cation exchange
   capacity, bulk density, total porosity, macroporosity, and total
   available and readily available water. Our objectives were to gauge the
   representativeness of the sample, determine the contribution from land
   use or soil order to variability, rationalize the data set, and identify
   concerns for long-term sustainable land use. Soil and land use
   combinations were both under- or overrepresented in the data set
   compared with national distribution. Soil order and land-use categories
   explained 55 to 76\% of the variance in soil properties. Total C
   contents of pastures were comparable with indigenous forest soils, but
   pastures were less acidic and with higher N and P contents. Plantation
   forests had characteristics similar to indigenous forests on comparable
   soils. Cropland soils comprised < 1 \% of the national land cover and
   generally had high inorganic fertility and low organic matter, with
   evidence of compaction. Seven characteristics (total C, total N,
   mineralizable N, pH, Olsen P, bulk density, and macroporosity) explained
   87\% of the total variability. The findings are being used by monitoring
   agencies to raise awareness about soil quality in the wider community,
   set land management guidelines, and develop policies.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving and maintaining a good soil quality is essential for
   sustaining agricultural production in an economically viable and
   environmentally safe manner. The transition of land management provides
   an opportunity to measure soil-quality indicators to quantify the
   effects of those management practices. This study compared soil chemical
   and physical properties after 10 years of grass on Conservation Reserve
   Program (CRP) land with those in continuously cropped land (CCL). The
   sample sites, located in central Kansas, have two mapping units, Harney
   silt loam (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Arigiustolls) and Naron
   fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Udic Argiustolls). Soil
   samples were collected at two depth increments, 0 to 5 cm and 5 to 10
   cm. Soil-quality indicators measured were soil acidity (pH),
   exchangeable cations, nutrients, total carbon, structure, and
   aggregation. Soil pH was significantly lower in CCL than in CRR Soil
   total C and N in the surface layer (0 to 5 cm) was much greater than in
   the deeper layer (5 to 10 cm) in the CRP site. The mass of total carbon
   of Naron soil was significantly higher for 0 to 5 cm and lower for 5 to
   10 cm depth in CRP land than in CCL. However, the mass of total carbon
   of Harney soil was significantly higher in no-tilled CCL than in CRP.
   Bulk density significantly increased in CCL. Based on dry and wet
   aggregate stability analysis, the results indicated that CRP land had a
   greater resistance to erosion by both water and wind than CCL. The
   improvements in soil quality resulting from CRP included reducing soil
   acidification, alleviating compaction, and reducing topsoil
   susceptibility to erosion. However, when CRP was taken out for crop
   production with conventional tillage, total carbon in the surface layer
   (0 to 5 cm) and aggregate stability gradually decreased. This suggested
   that appropriate land management practices are needed to extend residual
   benefit from CRP on soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Soil erosion and off-site transport of nutrients are reducing soil
   productivity and impacting water bodies across the world. Additionally,
   anthropogenic activities are increasing the atmospheric concentrations
   of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitric
   oxide (NO) that contribute to global warming. We want to present the
   concept that nutrient management plans should incorporate soil organic
   carbon (SOC) management to reduce soil erosion, cycle macro- and
   micronutrients, increase nutrient use efficiency, and conserve air,
   soil, and water quality. Plant-derived materials are the primary source
   of carbon (C) in soil organic matter (SOM), with C being the most
   abundant constituent and common partner of nitrogen (N), phosphorous
   (P), and sulfur (S). Manures, compost, and other organic sources can
   help cycle organic C and other nutrients. Organic C can contribute to
   forming chelate compounds that increase the availability of essential
   micronutrients that interchange with the root surface. Management
   practices that increase C inputs, help reduce erosion, and increase SOC
   improve soil quality factors such as cation exchange capacity, water
   holding capacity, aggregate formation, porosity, and drainage. Carbon
   management and nutrient cycling should be an integral part of nutrient

Abstract = {{Are present nutrient management recommendations for the world's major
   cereal cropping systems adequate to sustain the productivity gains
   required to meet food demand while also assuring acceptable standards of
   environmental quality? To address this question, the current nutrient
   management approaches and their scientific basis in large-scale,
   mechanized maize (Zea mays L.)-based cropping systems of the USA and
   more labor-intensive, small-scale irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.)
   production systems in Asia were evaluated. The principal challenges in
   both systems are similar: (1) there is no compelling evidence for
   significant increases in the genetic yield potential in both systems
   during the past 30 years, (2) farm yields are presently about 40-65\% of
   the attainable yield potential, and (3) nutrient management mostly
   relies on approaches that do not account for the dynamic nature of crop
   response to the environment. Because average farm yield levels of
   70-80\% of the attainable yield potential are necessary to meet expected
   food demand in the next 30 years, research must seek to develop nutrient
   management approaches that optimize profit, preserve soil quality, and
   protect natural resources in systems that consistently produce at these
   high yield levels. Achieving these goals will require novel strategies
   for more precise plant nutrient management tailored to the technologies,
   dynamics and spatial scales relevant to each system. Significant
   advances in soil chemistry, crop physiology, plant nutrition, molecular
   biology, and information technology must be combined in this effort.
   Future field-oriented plant nutrition research must be of a more
   strategic, interdisciplinary, and quantitative nature. Systems
   approaches at micro-to meso-scales are required for gaining a more
   quantitative understanding of crop response to nutrients based on
   interactions among the essential crop nutrient requirements and on
   response to dynamic environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid estimates of mineralizable N in soil are important for management
   decisions and soil quality assessments. We adapted and evaluated a rapid
   method based on measuring the gas pressure generated when soil is
   treated with Ca(ClO)(2) in a closed vessel. An experiment was conducted
   to determine the effects of reaction time, soil/reagent, and soil/water
   ratios on the gas pressure generated by the method. Based on this
   experiment, 5 g of soil, 5 mL of deionized water, 0.3 g Ca(ClO)(2), and
   a reaction time of 25 min were selected as optimum conditions. The
   method was evaluated with 60 Cecil (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic
   Kanhapludults) sandy loam samples ranging in organic C from 4 to 16 g C
   kg(-1). Nitrogen mineralized in 24 d and soil microbial biomass C (SMBC)
   were measured and related to the Ca(ClO)(2) method and to two other
   rapid methods, the flush of CO2 during 3 d following rewetting of a dry
   soil, and the NH4-N extractable with hot 2 M KCl. The Ca(ClO)(2) method
   (mmol kg(-1)) was strongly correlated with net N mineralized in 24 d (r
   = 0.77) and with microbial biomass C (r = 0.90). The method was also
   correlated with the flush of CO2 during 3 d following rewetting of dried
   soil (r = 0.85) and with the NH4-N extractable with hot 2 M KCl (r =
   0.86). These results indicate that the Ca(ClO)(2) method may be useful
   to make rapid estimates of mineralizable N and microbial biomass C in
   soil. Additional work is needed to investigate the nature of the
   compounds oxidized by the method.}},

Abstract = {{Increased disturbance of terrestrial ecosystems in recent years for
   purposes of mineral extraction has created interest in development and
   optimization of reclamation methodologies for these lands. Currently,
   criteria for judging surface mine reclamation success, or progress
   toward reclamation goals, predominantly rely on aboveground indicators
   that fail to account for the abundance and composition of soil
   microbiota, an essential aspect of soil health. To test the utility of
   fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) biomarkers as indicators of reclamation
   progress, FAME bacterial, fungal, and total biomass biomarkers extracted
   from soil of surface mine reclamation sites of different ages and an
   adjacent undisturbed site were compared with other indicators of
   reclamation progress and ecosystem stability. Our results indicate that
   FAME microbial biomarkers and soil organic matter (SOM) contents were
   greatly impacted by disturbance. Discriminant analysis of FAME
   bacterial, fungal and total microbial biomass biomarkers, although
   clearly able to discriminate between disturbed and undisturbed
   ecosystems, indicated a trend towards the undisturbed condition with
   reclamation age. The ratio of FAME bacterial to fungal biomarkers
   reflected changes in other indicators of soil health (SOM, inorganic N
   concentration), suggesting that this ratio is a useful indicator of
   reclamation progress. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider two important aspects in the complex problem
   of transboundary air pollution in Europe, namely (i) the interdependence
   of the problems of tropospheric ozone and acidification and (ii) the
   dynamic processes related to soil acidification. We develop an optimal
   control model to analyse the interaction between acidification as a
   stock pollutant and tropospheric ozone as a flow pollutant for several
   countries. Using a cost-benefit framework an analysis is performed to
   determine efficient emission paths for nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide
   and volatile organic compounds. The model jointly analyses acidification
   and ozone. The current European reduction plans do not fully take into
   account the multi-pollutants multi-targets nature of the problem. In
   addition, the plans allow for temporary exceedance of critical loads
   without considering the consequences for the temporal development of the
   soil quality. This paper shows the complex relations and interactions
   which one should deal with while designing policies that are efficient
   with respect to the cross-effects between the different environmental
   problems. It also shows how dynamic efficient abatement strategies would
   look if the cross effects and the dynamic processes in soil
   acidification are explicitly incorporated in the analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Organic agriculture is growing in importance worldwide. In the United
   States, the rate of increase of organic growers was estimated at 12\% in
   2000. However, many producers are reluctant to undertake the organic
   transition because of uncertainty of how organic production will affect
   weed population dynamics and management. The organic transition has a
   profound impact on the agroecosystem. Changes in soil physical and
   chemical properties during the transition often impact indirectly
   insect, disease, and weed dynamics. Greater weed species richness is
   usually found in organic farms but total weed density and biomass are
   often smaller under the organic system compared with the conventional
   system. The improved weed suppression of organic agriculture is probably
   the result of combined effects of several factors including weed seed
   predation by soil microorganisms, seedling predation by phytophagus
   insects, and the physical and allelopathic effects of cover crops.}},

Abstract = {{Since diversity suggests that changes in nematode populations or
   communities may be useful indicators of environmental changes including
   anthropogenic disturbances, in this study the following measurements
   were done : pH, predominant plant taxa, nematode density and diversity
   at different wetland points along La Tapera creek. A random sampling was
   carried out and data were subject to analysis Nest. In this work,
   neither the diversity nor the pH changed, however the latter was high
   and. nematode density and taxa were small but without significative
   oscillations between stations. However, other population indices showed
   consistent differences between sites, which are pointing out
   environmental alteration throughout the creek. These Preliminary results
   from the wetland present a description of nematode communities existing
   under a particular set of conditions that have not been reported

Abstract = {{Low organic matter levels and fragile structure of coarse textured soils
   from and and semiarid environments can lead to progressive degradation
   of their quality and productivity. Our objective was to evaluate the
   effects of land use on soil organic matter quality and quantity and
   biochemical properties related to soil microbial activity that are
   involved in the cycling of nutrients and carbon. Four sandy soils under
   different agricultural practices and four adjacent soils under grass
   cover in a Mediterranean environment comprising the humid-temperature
   climate of centralwest Italy were characterised chemically and
   biochemically. A sensitivity index was calculated for each of the
   measured properties by dividing the values for uncultivated soils with
   their cultivated counterparts. A metabolic potential index was
   calculated as the ratio between dehydrogenase activity (DHase), and
   water-soluble carbon (WSC). There was a general decline of total organic
   carbon (TOC), extractable humic substances (HS), WSC, water-soluble
   carbohydrates (WSCH), DHase, urease, protease, phosphatase and
   beta-glucosidase activities following the different agricultural
   practices with respect to soil under grass cover. DHase, urease and
   phosphatase activities were more sensitive and responded more frequently
   to land use than TOC and WSC and WSCH. DHase/WSC ratio confirmed the
   reduction of cultivated soils metabolism as consequence of management
   practices. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Developing strategies that foster sustainable land management in the
   hillsides of Central America poses a particular challenge. This research
   provides empirical and qualitative evidence regarding the impact of
   local farmers' land management decisions on the sustainability of land
   use, in conjunction with the specific environmental context. A set of
   indicators suitable for evaluating impacts in a mixed land use,
   steeply-sloped catchment in a rural setting in Central Honduras was
   selected. In the first phase of the study, measured attributes
   indicating the leakiness of, or tendency for water and sediment to be
   redistributed within or away from a given site were used to assess the
   impact of movement of sediment, water and nutrients among patches within
   the landscape. At any given site, one or two factors contributed to
   overall leakiness, but with no consistent pattern. Patterns of land use
   are not strictly related to particular landforms in the catchment. The
   frequency, intensity and location of transfer processes responsible for
   the movement of sediment and water were evaluated in the second phase,
   and the most influential processes identified. Both natural and
   anthropogenic factors of the study influenced the movement of sediment
   and water, which varied throughout the catchment. At the broadest scale,
   surface water flow, landslides and slope failure, and land use change
   affect overall catchment integrity, threatening sustainability in some
   cases. Overall, the study successfully linked management produces to
   landscape features and transfer processes, established patterns of
   degradation, and identified, cases where the combination of
   anthropogenic and natural factors has resulted in unsustainable land
   use. In all cases, the scale of observation determined the dominant
   factors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the application of an optimisation model for
   calculating cost-effective abatement strategies for the reduction of
   acidification in Europe while taking into account the dynamic character
   of soil acidification in a number of countries. Environmental
   constraints are defined in terms of soil quality indicators, e.g., pH,
   base saturation or the aluminium ion concentration in the soil solution
   within an optimisation model for transboundary air pollution.
   We present a case study for Ireland and the United Kingdom. Our results
   indicate that reduction of sulphur dioxide emission is more
   cost-effective than that of nitrogen oxides or ammonia. The reduction
   percentages for sulphur dioxide are highest, for two reasons: (i)
   marginal sulphur dioxide reduction costs are relatively low compared to
   marginal reduction costs of nitrogen oxides and ammonia and (ii) sulphur
   dioxide reduction is more effective in reducing acidification in
   physical terms than nitrogen oxides or ammonia abatement. Our dynamic
   analysis shows that a (fast) improvement of soil quality requires high
   emission reduction levels. These reduction levels are often higher than
   reduction levels that are typically deduced from the static critical
   loads approach. Once soil quality targets are reached, in our model,
   less stringent emission reductions are required to maintain the soil
   quality at a constant and ``good{''} target level. Static critical load
   approaches that ignore dynamic aspects therefore may underestimate the
   emission reductions needed to achieve predefined soil quality targets.}},

Abstract = {{Both empirical and process-simulation models are useful in predicting
   the outcome of agricultural management on soil quality and vice versa,
   and pedotransfer functions have been developed to translate readily
   available soil information into variables that are needed in the models.
   The input data are subject to error, and consequently the transfer
   functions can produce varied outputs. A general approach to quantifying
   the resulting uncertainty is to use Monte Carlo methods. By sampling
   repeatedly from the assumed probability distributions of the input
   variables and evaluating the response of the model, the statistical
   distribution of the outputs can be estimated. Methods for sampling the
   probability distribution include simple random sampling, the sectioning
   method, and Latin hypercube sampling. The Latin hypercube sampling is
   applied to the quantification of uncertainties in pedotransfer functions
   of soil strength and soil hydraulic properties. Hydraulic properties
   predicted using recently developed pedotransfer functions are also used
   in a model to analyse the uncertainties in the prediction of soil-water
   regimes in the field. The uncertainties of hydraulic properties in
   soil-water simulation show that the model is sensitive to the soil's
   moisture state.}},

Abstract = {{The landscapes of the French island of Corsica are the result of the
   grazing tradition which has always occupied a pivotal position in the
   island's economy. Furthermore, in the last fifty years, a reduction in
   the pressure from human activity has lead to changes in plant cover.
   This article intends to study the evolution of dynamic mechanisms during
   the secondary successions and the effect of changes in vegetation on
   plant diversity. Our study was based on a simultaneous study of 375
   plots carried out between May and September from 1996 to 1998. We
   studied the floristic composition of each stage both qualitatively (life
   form, adaptive strategy and seed dispersal mode) and quantitatively
   (species richness, equitability, Shannon index). The results show a
   change in species and environmental conditions, with a progressive move
   from heliophilic grassland and low shrub species with an S or SR
   strategy, anemochoric and with a high tolerance for soil quality to a
   final stage of dense forest composed of competitive (C or CS) zoochoric
   or barochoric phanerophytes. Moreover, the turning point in Corsica in
   terms of floristic diversity lies between 20 and 55 years after land
   abandonment. Successions are due to a series of rapid interactions.
   Thus, when a site is given reserve or protected area status, we need to
   take into account the fact that it will evolve according to the
   biological traits of the species. From a research point of view, we need
   to look at process diversity and the role of each of the species present
   during the successions.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major interests in soil analysis is the integrated evaluation
   of soil properties, which might be indicators of soil quality.
   Unsupervised methods of multivariate statistics are powerful tools for
   this integrated assessment and can help soil researchers to extract much
   more information from their data. A multivariate study was carried out
   in three farms from Guaira, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Conventionally
   managed plots that intensively utilized pesticides and chemical
   fertilizers were compared with both non-disturbed forest areas and
   alternatively managed plots. The latter were under ecological farming
   employing effective microorganisms (EM) integrated with crop residues.
   Eight soil parameters were determined for each plot. Hierarchical
   cluster analysis (HCA) was used to verify the similarity among the
   plots. The multivariate approach of principal component analysis (PCA)
   allowed us to distinguish the areas as a function of the soil management
   and determine which are the most important parameters to characterize
   them. The forest areas presented higher microbial biomass with lower
   cellulolytics population than at cultivated sites. The alternative plots
   were characterized by higher microbial biomass and polysaccharide
   content with lower phosphate solubilizers and cellulolytics
   microorganisms colony counts than at the conventional areas. The higher
   observed levels of microbial biomass and polysaccharide content in the
   alternative areas can be attributed to the effects of the alternative
   soil amendment. All these effects can be clearer globally visualized
   with the aid of PCA, through the biplots. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{In the Sahel, promising technologies for agricultural intensification
   include millet stover mulching and ridging. A four year on-farm
   experiment was set-up in order to assess the effect of various
   combinations of these two technologies on soil chemical and physical
   quality in a millet (Pennisetum glauctim (L.) R. Br.) - cowpea (Vigna
   unguiculata (L.) Walp.) relay intercropping system. Treatments included
   bare surface, ridging, a surface applied banded millet stover mulch (2 t
   ha(-1)) and a banded millet stover mulch (2 t ha(-1)) buried in ridges.
   The latter three treatments were implemented exclusively in the cowpea
   rows, with an annual rotation between the millet and cowpea rows. Both
   the bare and ridge plots experienced a rapid loss of organic carbon,
   acidification and the development of extensive surface crusts but no
   increase in bulk density or penetration resistance. In the year of
   application, mulching improved soil quality in the cowpea row with
   respect to pH, organic carbon and exchangeable K+ and Mg++ content,
   penetration resistance and bulk density, and it reduced the decline in
   exchangeable Ca++ and total N content. In the year following mulch
   application, a general decline in soil chemical quality was observed in
   the millet row, except for organic carbon content, and a positive
   residual effect was observed on penetration resistance and bulk density.
   As a rule, the effects of mulching in the year of application tended to
   be stronger in the ridged treatment with buried residue than in the
   banded surface mulch. In the year following application, this tendency
   was reversed. For the purpose of reducing soil degradation by nutrient
   mining and wind erosion, a banded surface mulch therefore appeared more
   effective than buried mulch.}},

Abstract = {{The use of ``conservation tillage{''} and associated conservation
   cropping systems are beneficial to long-term soil quality improvement,
   erosion control, and environmental protection. A common element in such
   conservation systems is the use of crop residues to cover and
   continuously protect the soil surface.
   An approach now being adopted in the U.S. is strip tillage, in which
   residue clearing and tillage are limited to strips or bands of soil
   where rows will be located for the next crop. Strip tillage may be a
   fall or spring field-operation and may-include applications of
   fertilizers. The tilled area should not exceed 25\% of the field area to
   maintain enough residue cover to protect the soil.
   In this article, field machine alternatives to achieve spring strip
   tillage are discussed and data are presented from 1999 and 2060
   comparison tests of eight tillage/seeding systems for corn and grain
   sorghum. The study included one-pass and two-pass strip tillage systems
   compared with no-till alternatives. Study comparisons were-for tillage
   effect only and did-hot include fertilizer application with the strip
   tillage. With the information available from this study, we would
   eliminate further consideration of the four experimental one-pass
   treatments and select either the standard one-pass no-till systems or
   the two-pass strip tillage systems for these crops and field conditions.}},

Abstract = {{INCO Ltd. near Sudbury, Ontario is rehabilitating nickel- and
   copper-mine tailings using vegetating techniques that have resulted in
   habitats of varying age and complexity. Mite (Acari) communities and
   soil quality characteristics were used to evaluate soil ecosystem
   development on four tailings sites, 0, 8, 20 and 40 years post
   rehabilitation in comparison with that on four control sites. Abundance,
   species richness, diversity (H) and community structure of soil mites
   were sensitive indicators of tailings rehabilitation and soil formation.
   Mite density on older and botanically diverse tailings sites was
   comparable to that on control sites; however, species richness of
   oribatids and mesostigmatics was lower than on control sites. Mite
   species richness and diversity on tailings were lower at less
   botanically diverse sites regardless of age. Similarity of tailings-mite
   communities to control-site communities generally increased with age;
   however, similarities were all less than 60\% (Sorenson's quantitative
   index, CN). Mite assemblages on tailings were dominated by a few
   colonizing species, whereas control sites had a diverse assemblage of
   species. Soil pH and organic matter (SOM) of rehabilitated tailings
   improved with age and degree of botanical complexity. Mite density and
   diversity was positively related to SOM particularily for the Oribatida.
   SOM and mites were mainly restricted to the 0-5-cm horizon.}},

Abstract = {{At present, fertilizer industry plants are considered as a potential
   source of soil contamination in Russia. Therefore health risk assessment
   should be pursued in Russian fertilizer plant areas, but unfortunately
   risk assessment methodology for contaminated sites does not have yet a
   regulatory value in Russia. In this paper a possible and intentionally
   simple regulatory approach for health cancer risk assessment at
   phosphogypsum waste-storing potentially contaminated sites is presented.
   The proposed approach is applied to a potential contaminated area
   located in the Moscow river (Moscow Region) protective zone. At this
   case-study area, arsenic has been chosen as a contaminant indicator,
   according to the proposed selection procedure. For estimating the human
   exposure to arsenic through various pathways the original McKone \&
   Daniels `91 model has been adapted. As a specific result of the risk
   assessment for the case-study area, it has been shown that arsenic
   exposure pathways (in risk-ranking order) ``ingestion of agricultural
   products,{''}. ``groundwater uptake,{''} ``dermal contact,{''} and
   ``soil ingestion{''} pose a significant health risk. From a general
   point of view, the proposed and applied health risk assessment approach
   could give some contribution (for comparison and discussion) for
   policies on contaminated soils to other countries. In this perspective,
   the paper expressly considers the current Italian regulative situation
   concerning restricted use of risk analysis and concerning soil quality
   for agricultural land use. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).}},

Abstract = {{Stability of soil structure represents an indicator of soil quality. The
   aim of this paper was to assess the effect of soil properties on
   structure vulnerability in an Orthic Luvisol. The aggregates were most
   vulnerable to fast wetting (mean K-v1 = 9.99, i.e. this effect can
   decrease the aggregate size 9.99 times). Lower destruction was caused by
   slow wetting and drying (K-v2 = 3.70) and mechanical forces (K-v3 =
   1.67). Fine silt (particles of 0.002-0.01 mm) was the most important
   soil characteristic decreasing aggregate vulnerability (r = -0.334,
   -0.248, and -0.393 for K-v1, K-v2, and K-v3, respectively). Silt
   (0.01-0.05 mm) increased vulnerability to fast wetting (r = 0.318). Very
   fine sand (0.05-0.1 mm) increased vulnerability to mechanical impacts (r
   = 0.307). Organic carbon decreased vulnerability only slightly. Humus
   quality was rather related to porosity. Higher moisture of samples in
   time of collection increased aggregate vulnerability. Multiple
   regression, used for description of the effect of basic soil properties,
   provided the best model for K-v1 (R-2 = 27.45\%), the poorest for K-v2
   (R-2 = 7.23\%).}},

Abstract = {{Reduced tillage systems may be an option to allow rapid crop
   establishment in areas constrained by a short growing season, but such
   methods need to be adapted to soil tillage requirement and crop
   establishment needs. Rotation and tillage studies were conducted during
   a 6-year period on a fine sandy loam (Podzol) with silage maize (Zea
   mays L.) under the cool, humid climate, and relatively short growing
   season of Prince Edward Island, Atlantic Canada. The objective was to
   compare a continuous maize rotation with a maize-barley (Hordeum vulgare
   L.) rotation, using both no-tillage and conventional mouldboard
   ploughing for the maize, and to evaluate treatment effects on maize
   growth and productivity, weed populations, and soil quality. Plant
   population and maize yield were not consistently influenced by the
   tillage or rotation treatments. Mean maize yield ranged from 7.2 to 7.7
   Mg ha(-1). An increasing density of weeds over the 6-year period,
   especially perennial species, was evident under no-tillage, compared to
   mouldboard ploughing. Except for slight changes in soil pH, spatial
   variation in extractable soil P, and a higher level of organic C and
   labile forms of C (microbial biomass and mineralizable C), soil chemical
   quality was similar among treatments. An apparent decline in soil
   physical quality, as indicated by a reduction in macro-porosity volume
   and increase in soil penetration resistance below the 8 cm soil depth,
   was evident under the no-tillage at the end of the 6-year period.
   However, macro-pore continuity was less affected by a reduction in
   tillage, while field measurements of soil hydraulic conductivity
   increased under no-tillage compared to ploughing. The latter result may
   be related to the observed increase in earthworm population where
   tillage was reduced. Use of rotational tillage resulted in an
   intermediate soil physical condition between continuous no-tillage and
   ploughing. Overall, no-tillage appears a promising strategy to
   facilitate a fast and early establishment of maize on sandy loam soils
   in Atlantic Canada, but some ongoing monitoring of the soil physical
   condition would be required. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Soil biochemical properties under long-term crop management systems may
   be useful indicators of soil quality. We measured seven enzyme
   activities and six calculated biological indices at four adjacent study
   sites on an andosol in a semiarid area of eastern Sicily. Soils were
   sampled under natural grassland (NG), orange-grove (OG), winter wheat
   (WW) and horticultural crop (HC) managed according to local agricultural
   usage. The enzymes investigated were dehydrogenase, catalase, protease,
   alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase and amylase. The calculated
   biological indices were hydrolyzing coefficient, enzyme activity number,
   biological index of fertility, metabolic potential, lability index and C
   management index. Tilled management systems (WW and HC) were lower in
   total organic C and N and in all the enzyme activities and biological
   indices than in untilled management systems (NG and OG). Catalase
   activity and hydrolyzing coefficient were the most suitable soil
   biochemical properties for differentiating between the effects of
   different crop management systems, because of their analytical
   simplicity and rapidity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To elucidate how atmospheric CO2 enrichment enhanced nutrient supply and
   soil quality interact to affect regrowth of temperate forests young
   Fagus syl vatica and Picea abies trees were grown together in large
   model ecosystems Identical communities were established on a nutrient
   poor acidic and on a more fertile calcareous soil and tree growth leaf
   area index fine root density and soil respiration monitored over four
   complete growing seasons Biomass responses to CO2 enrichment and
   enhanced N supply at the end of the experiment reflected compound
   interest effects of growth stimulation during the first two to three
   seasons rather than persistent stimulation over the whole duration of
   the experiment Whereas biomass of Picea was enhanced in elevated CO2 on
   both soils Fagus responded negatively to CO2 on acidic but positively on
   calcareous soil Biomass of both species profited from enhanced N supply
   on the poor acidic soil only Leaf area index on both soils was greater
   in high N supply as a consequence of a stimulation early in the
   experiment but was unaffected by CO2 enrichment Fine root density on
   acidic soil was in creased in high N supply but this did not stimulate
   soil respiration rate In contrast elevated CO2 stimulated both fine root
   density and Soil CO2 efflux on calcareous soil especially towards the
   end of the experiment Our experiment suggests that future species
   dominance in beech spruce forests is likely to change in response to CO2
   enrichment but this response is subject to complex interactions with
   environmental factors other than CO2 particularly soil type.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses changes in selected properties of a Calcixeroll
   soil, including total and particulate soil organic matter, pH, total N
   and aggregation, subjected for 11 consecutive years to various
   conservation and conventional agricultural systems. Tillage systems
   included no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT); crop rotations
   were Continuous Wheat; Fallow-Wheat, Fallow-Wheat-Corn,
   Fallow-Wheat-Forage and Fallow-Wheat-Lentils. Higher aggregation,
   organic matter contents, pH and particulate organic matter (POM)
   build-up are major changes associated with a shift from a conventional-
   to a no-tillage system. The fallow system resulted in a reduction of
   soil organic matter (SOM) content, but 3-year wheat rotations including
   fallow tended to improve soil quality attributes more than 2-year wheat
   rotations. Another important finding is the accumulation of SOM (in
   terms of carbon and nitrogen) in the NT surface horizon (0-2.5 cm)
   without depletion at the deeper horizon (2.5-20 cm) compared to the
   tilled treatments. There was an increase in SOM in the topsoil (0-20 cm)
   over the 11-yr study period under NT, while CT did not affect this soil
   quality indicator much. Benefits from crop rotation in terms of organic
   matter varied, with fallow-wheat-forage exhibiting the maximum value.
   Better stability of aggregates was demonstrated by a significantly
   greater aggregation index (mean weight diameter) value under NT (3.8 mm)
   than under the CT system (3.2 mm) at the soil surface. Hence, combined
   use of no-tillage and 3-yr rotation helped to improve soil quality in
   this experiment.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted in a long-term field experiment initiated in 1939
   at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. The aim was to assess the
   long-term effect of direct N and K and residual P fertilizers on
   chemical and microbial properties of soil and grain yield of maize in
   rotation with field pea. Long-term fertilization resulted in decreased
   total organic C (TOC) and basic cation contents, and had an acidifying
   effect on soil. The decrease in TOC was greater in simple fertilizer
   treatments (N, P, or K) whereas basic cation contents and pH declined
   more in balanced fertilizer treatments (NPK). Levels of total N were
   higher in the balanced than in simple fertilizer treatments. Soil
   microbial biomass and numbers of bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi were
   influenced by, and exhibited qualitative changes in response to,
   long-term fertilization. Crop rotation also exerted effects on chemical
   and microbial properties of the soil. Maize grain yield showed
   significant increases due to balanced fertilizer treatments. Responses
   of maize to simple fertilizer applications were not beneficial in terms
   of yield returns. The results suggested that judicious use of inorganic
   fertilizers may, in the long-term, maintain soil quality and productive
   capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Sales of organic products reached \$8 billion in the U.S. in 2000,
   continuing the nearly decade-long trend of 20\% annual growth. In Iowa
   alone, organic production for all crops was 5265 ha (13,000 acres) in
   1995 but 60,750 ha (150,000 acres) in 1999. Despite the growth in
   organic agriculture, our knowledge of organic farming systems remains
   limited. We have adopted a systems theory approach in our current
   research program at Iowa State University (ISU) to help address this gap
   in understanding. Systems theory holds that biological systems, such as
   agroecosystems, consist of integrated units of people, plants, animals,
   soil, insects and microorganisms, and each subsystem provides feedback
   to the other. In order to obtain input on research questions and
   experimental design, the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture and
   ISU held six focus groups across Iowa in 1998 before long-term site
   establishment. Producers and agricultural professionals at the focus
   groups supported the need for long-term agroccological research (LTAR)
   sites in four distinct agroecological zones in Iowa. The goal of each
   LTAR is to examine the short- and long-term physical, biological, and
   socioeconomic effects of organic and conventional farming systems. By
   establishing long-term experiments, we are testing the hypothesis that
   longer crop rotations, typical of organic farms, provide yield
   stability, improve plant protection, and enhance soil health and
   economic benefits compared to conventional systems with shorter
   rotations and greater off-farm inputs. Examples of research results from
   two LTAR experiments in Iowa include similar pepper (Capsicum annuum)
   and soybean (Glycine max) yields in the conventional and organic
   systems. Organic systems used mechanical weed control and locally
   produced compost in place of synthetic fertilizers. Feedback from the
   local farm associations that are responsible for farm stewardship and
   farm finances is inherent in the LTAR process.}},

Abstract = {{The Center for Environmental Farming Systems (CEFS) is dedicated to
   farming systems that are environmentally, economically, and socially
   sustainable. Established in 1994 at the North Carolina Department of
   Agriculture and Consumer Services (NCDACS) Cherry Farm near Goldsboro,
   N.C.; CEFS operations extend over a land area of about 800 ha (2000
   acres) {[}400 ha (1000 acres) cleared]. This unique center is a
   partnership among North Carolina State University (NCSU), North Carolina
   Agriculture and Technical State University (NCATSU), NCDACS,
   nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), other state and federal agencies,
   farmers and citizens. Long-term approaches that integrate the broad
   range of factors involved in agricultural systems are the focus of the
   Farming Systems Research Unit. The goal is to provide the empirical
   framework to address landscape-scale issues that impact long-run
   sustainability of North Carolina's agriculture. To this end, data
   collection and analyses include soil parameters (biological, chemical,
   physical), pests and predators (weeds, insects and disease), crop
   factors (growth, yield, and quality), economic factors, and energy
   issues. Five systems are being compared: a successional ecosystem, a
   plantation forestry-woodlot, an integrated crop-animal production
   system, an organic production system, and a cash-grain {[}best
   management practice (BMP)] cropping system. An interdisciplinary team of
   scientists from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at NCSU and
   NCATSU, along with individuals from the NCDACS, NGO representatives, and
   farmers are collaborating in this endeavor. Experimental design and
   protocol are discussed, in addition to challenges and opportunities in
   designing and implementing long-term farming systems trials.}},

Abstract = {{The competitiveness of plants within a community is dictated to some
   extent by their association with microorganisms in the soil. That
   association is affected. by root exudates and possibly by their quality.
   The competitiveness of species under various grazing regimes has been
   defined by their response to grazing as decreaser, increaser, or
   invader. To test the hypothesis that there are recognisable differences
   in the chemical fingerprints of the root exudates of decreasers,
   increasers and invaders, seeds of 8 grasses, representing these 3
   designations, were germinated and grown for 2 weeks in a root exudate
   trapping system in the laboratory. Tentative identification of the suite
   of compounds recovered from the root exudates by a solvent extraction
   technique was done with the help of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
   and authentic samples. Eleven identified compounds. present in all
   exudates as major peaks, but absent in the blanks, were selected for
   semi-quantitatively comparing the 3 grazing response groups. For all 11
   compounds. there was always at least 1 of the grazing response groups
   that had the highest percentages. That is to say, they were
   qualitatively, based on the 11 compounds selected, but not
   quantitatively similar.}},

Abstract = {{The exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere, biosphere and
   pedosphere is an important consideration when assessing agricultural and
   environmental management or policy decisions and their relationship to
   climate change. Field experimentation is the best way to gather data,
   but experimental data are specific to the management, soils and climate
   that represent the research site. Inadequate field data exist to address
   all management options across all soil types and climates. We have used
   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change inventory approach to
   estimate changes in soil carbon storage resulting from various land use
   and management options. We generate a regional assessment of the
   relative impact of implementing changes in agricultural management on
   soil carbon storage. For each agricultural region of the United States,
   we present an estimated annual change in soil carbon storage for each
   management option. Results should prove especially useful in evaluating
   management options and tradeoffs.}},

   irrigated agriculture were examined for the Tierra Blanca Creek
   watershed in the central Texas panhandle. Average and maximum nitrogen
   (N) and phosphorus (P) losses in runoff and tong-term accumulations of P
   in the topsoil were simulated. These factors were considered to be
   environmental indicators of water and soil quality when applying manure
   and commercial fertilizers. Costs and profitability of alternative
   manure management strategies were compared to determine how to best
   safeguard the environment while maximizing profits. The study found that
   both objectives could be achieved with the application of N fertilizer
   combined with a reduced manure rate using conservation tillage to
   eliminate following. A sensitivity analysis of the price of anhydrous
   ammonia indicated that a 50\% increase would, however, reduce the
   profitability of this strategy to less than that of the two all-manure
   utilization strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of addition of a municipal solid waste (MSW) compost and its
   water-soluble and humic fraction to suppress the effect of Pythium
   ultimum on pea plants was studied and compared with that of a chemical
   pesticide (metalaxyl). The biotic and abiotic characteristics of compost
   involved in the biocontrol effects of these materials were also
   evaluated. The addition into soil of whole composts and their humic
   fractions reduced the effect of the pathogen on pea plants,
   significantly reducing the number of root lesions and Pythium
   populations and avoiding reductions of plant growth. The greatest
   pathogen suppression was achieved with the chemical pesticide. However,
   it also caused a significant decrease in the number of nontarget
   bacteria and fungi and on beneficial soil microorganisms such as
   Trichoderma and Pseudomonas. Addition of organic amendments increased
   population size of nontarget and specific biocontrol microorganisms. The
   humic fraction showed similar results to compost. All this suggests that
   metalaxyl has a nonspecific effect, producing adverse effects on aspects
   of soil quality. This was avoided if the chemical pesticide was reduced
   and replaced by organic amendments such as an MSW compost or its humic
   fraction.}},

Abstract = {{The 1985 U.S. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was modified in the
   1996 Farm Bill, which authorized a total enrollment of up to 14.8
   million ha, an early termination of certain CRP contracts, and
   additional new enrollments. This study used soil, land-use, groundwater,
   and other environmental layers from currently available sources of
   information for Finney County, Kansas, By using a geographic information
   system (GIS), we found that aquifer thickness, coinciding with gas or
   oil fields, was closely associated with the distribution of CRP land
   while other factors such as soil, aquifer depth, physiography, or slope
   had little effect on the CRP We generated a map that outlined those CRP
   lands eligible for early termination. By using the state soil geographic
   database to designate the conservation priority areas and soil erosion
   index as the criterion to rank potential CRP lands, we created another
   map showing areas best suited for new CRP bids.}},

Abstract = {{This article questions poverty as a (major) cause of environmental
   degradation and the assumption that the poor are caught in a vicious
   circle with regard to their natural resource management. Examining the
   soil management of farmers of different poverty level in three Honduran
   watersheds, the article explores the relationships between poverty, soil
   quality, and soil management strategy. It argues that the relationship
   between the overall level of poverty and soil degradation often is a
   statistical artifact, resulting from a failure to disaggregate the soil
   management of the poor and the nonpoor, rather than a casual
   relationship. Further, the article shows that although they are
   inhibited from using chemical fertilizers due to capital constraints,
   poor farmers are no less likely than nonpoor farmers to adopt labor- and
   land-requiring soil-conserving measures.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality is a concept based on the premise that management can
   deteriorate, stabilize, or improve soil ecosystem functions. It is
   hypothesized that the degree of stratification of soil organic C and N
   pools with soil depth, expressed as a ratio, could indicate soil quality
   or soil ecosystem functioning, because surface organic matter is
   essential to erosion control, water infiltration, and conservation of
   nutrients. Stratification ratios allow a wide diversity of soils to be
   compared on the same assessment scale because of an internal
   normalization procedure that accounts for inherent soil differences.
   Stratification ratios of soil organic C were 1.1, 1.2 and 1.9 under
   conventional tillage (CT) and 3.4, 2.0 and 2.1 under no tillage (NT) in
   Georgia, Texas, and Alberta/British Columbia, respectively. The
   difference in stratification ratio between conventional and NT within an
   environment was inversely proportional to the standing stock of soil
   organic C to a depth of 15-20 cm across environments. Greater
   stratification of soil C and N pools with the adoption of conservation
   tillage under inherently low soil organic matter conditions (i.e.,
   warmer climatic regime or coarse-textured soil) suggests that standing
   stock of soil organic matter alone is a poor indication of soil quality.
   Stratification of biologically active soil C and N pools (i.e., soil
   microbial biomass and potential activity) were equally or more sensitive
   to tillage, cropping intensity, and soil textural variables than
   stratification of total C and N. High stratification ratios of soil C
   and N pools could be good indicators of dynamic soil quality,
   independent of soil type and climatic regime, because ratios >2 would be
   uncommon under degraded conditions. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Soil degradation due to tillage has been reported Africa-wide. Other
   main causes of soil degradation are overgrazing, extensive cultivation
   of marginal lands, widespread clearing of vegetation for agriculture,
   deforestation, exploitation of unsuitable agricultural technologies,
   mis-management of arable lands, and frequent drought. Hence, declining
   soil fertility and increasing population pressure on lands are fragile
   bases on which to build expectations for improved crop production. This
   paper recognizes conservation tillage systems as one means for
   preventing food shortages and natural resources degradation throughout
   the continent. Conservation tillage has the potential for increasing
   soil organic matter content and enhancing soil aggregation. Conservation
   tillage systems can create an aggregated, fertile surface layer that is
   important from a soil erosion reduction perspective and thus for a
   sustainable agriculture in Africa. Some indigenous tillage systems in
   Africa can be adapted to meet objectives of conservation tillage
   systems. Further, recent technological developments in tillage and
   seeding machinery will certainly enhance the rate of farmer's acceptance
   and adoption of conservation tillage. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Surface accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) under conservation
   tillage has significant effects on stratification of other nutrients, on
   crop productivity and in ameliorating the greenhouse effect via
   atmospheric CO, sequestration. A measure of SOC stratification relative
   to deeper soil layers has been proposed as a soil quality index. Our
   objective was to determine the effects of the duration of tillage
   practices upon the SOC and extractable P distribution with depth in
   Maury silt loams (Typic Paleudalfs) at similar levels of corn (Zea mays
   L.) productivity without P fertilization. Soil samples (0-20.0 cm in 2.5
   cm increments) were collected under moldboard tillage (MT), chisel
   tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) and in surrounding tall fescue (Festuca
   arundinacea L.) sods selected from three tillage experiments (1-2-, 8-
   and 29-year durations) in Kentucky. SOC stratification was greater under
   conservation tillage (CT and NT) and sods than under MT. SOC and
   soil-test-extractable P stratification were positively related.
   Increasing the duration under NT caused the thickness of C
   stratification to increase. In NT soils, C stratification ratio (CSR)
   approached CSR in the nearby long-term sods with time. Conservation
   tillage rapidly promoted the occurrence of CSR greater than 2 while MT
   always resulted in values lower than 2. The rapid initial change in CSR
   suggests characterization of thin soil layers (i.e. 2.5 cm depth
   increments) is desirable under conservation tillage. (C) 2002 Elsevier

   aggregation and water infiltration. Two soils (Typic Kanhapludults), one
   under long-term management of conventional tillage (CT) and one under
   long-term management of no tillage (NT), were sampled to a depth of 12
   cm. Soil cores (15 cm diameter) were either left intact or sieved and
   repacked to differentiate between short-term (sieving) and long-term
   (tillage management) effects of soil disturbance on water infiltration,
   penetration resistance, soil bulk density, macroaggregate stability, and
   soil organic carbon (SOC). Mean weekly water infiltration was not
   different between sieved and intact cores from long-term CT (22 cm
   h(-1)), but was significantly greater in intact (72 cm h(-1)) than in
   sieved (28 cm h(-1)) soil from long-term NT. The stratification ratio of
   SOC (i.e., of 0-3 cm depth divided by that of 6-12 cm depth) was
   predictive of water infiltration rate, irrespective of short- or
   long-term history of disturbance. Although tillage is used to increase
   soil porosity, it is a short-term solution that has negative
   consequences on surface soil structural stability, surface residue
   accumulation, and surface-SOC, which are critical features that control
   water infiltration and subsequent water transmission and storage in
   soil. The stratification ratio of SOC could be used as a simple
   diagnostic tool to identify land management strategies that improve soil
   water properties (e.g., infiltration, water-holding capacity, and
   plant-available water). Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Consultants, farm advisors, resource conservationists, and other land
   managers may benefit from decision tools that help identify the most
   sustainable management practices. Indices of soil quality (SQIs) can
   provide this service. Various methods were tested for choosing a minimum
   data set (MDS), transforming the indicators, and calculating indices
   using data from alternative vegetable production systems being evaluated
   near Davis, California. The MDS components were chosen using expert
   opinion (EO) or principal components analysis (PCA) as a data reduction
   technique. Multiple regressions of the MDS indicators (as independent
   variables) against indicators representing management goals (as
   iterative dependent variables) showed no significant differences between
   the EO and PCA selection techniques in their abilities to explain
   variability within each sustainable management goal. Linear and
   non-linear scoring techniques were also compared for MDS indicators. The
   non-linear scoring method was determined to be more representative of
   system function than the linear method. Finally, indicator scores were
   combined using either an additive index, a weighted additive index, or a
   decision support system. For almost all indexing combinations, the
   organic system received significantly higher SQI values than the low
   input or conventional treatments. The efficacy of the indices was tested
   by comparisons with individual indicators, variables representative of
   management goals, and another multivariate technique for decision making
   that used all available data rather than a subset (MDS). Comparison with
   the comprehensive multivariate technique showed results similar to all
   of the indexing combinations except the additive and weighted indices
   using the linearly scored, EO-selected MDS. This suggests that a small
   number of carefully chosen soil quality indicators, when used in a
   simple, non-linearly scored index, can adequately provide information
   needed for selection of best management practices. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In grassed-down apple orchards in New Zealand, the understorey
   vegetation is usually mown and the plant residues are returned to the
   orchard floors as a source of nutrients. It is, therefore, important to
   determine the decomposition pattern and the rate of N release from
   understorey plant residues. In this study, the decomposition and N
   release of surface-placed understorey plant residues were determined in
   the field and compared across treatments of grassed-down biological
   (BFP) and integrated fruit production (IFP) orchards in two different
   locations (Lincoln and Clyde) in New Zealand using the litterbag
   technique. At Lincoln, the field experiment was a randomised complete
   block design with three different treatments (two BFPs, one IFP) each
   with three replicates; while at Clyde, the field experiment consisted of
   non-replicated apple orchard plots with three treatments (two IFPs, one
   BFP). A comparison was also made between surface-placed and soil-buried
   understorey plant residues in a BFP orchard at one location. Samples of
   understorey plant residues collected from orchard mowings in the
   respective treatments were returned to the same treatment plot in
   litterbags and retrieved at intervals of 90 days for 360-450 days.
   Results showed that the single exponential decay model, Y=A(0) e(-kt),
   accounted significantly (Pless than or equal to0.001) for 97-99\% of the
   variation in the decomposition and N release patterns, which ranged from
   6.0x10(-3)-9.6x10(-3) day(-1) and 7.0x10(-3)-13.0x10(-3) day(-1),
   respectively. Half-lives for C and N of residues were approximately
   70-120 days and 50-110 days, respectively. Soil-buried plant residues
   showed more rapid decomposition and N release compared with those of
   surface-placed plant residues (80\% vs. 54\% in 90 days). In general,
   plant residue decomposition and N release were significantly more rapid
   in IFP than in BFP treatments (13.0x10(-3) vs 7.0x10(-3) day(-1) for N
   release). Overall, differences in plant residue decomposition and N
   release rates related to understorey plant residue quality and treeline
   management practices rather than the orchard system as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this investigation was to evaluate some chemical,
   physical, biological and biochemical parameters and to determine a
   minimum data set to establish a soil quality index. Four different forms
   of management (native forest soil, soil deforested in 1982 and 1983 and
   under natural pasture for the last 8-10 years, soil deforested 26 years
   ago and under no-tillage for 6 years, and soil deforested 40 years ago
   and under conventional tillage) were established in an experimental site
   located in Entre Rios Province, Argentina in a Vertic Argiudoll soil.
   Soils sampled from the different treatments were monitored for their
   organic C, total N and extractable P contents and for aggregate
   stability, respiration C, dehydrogenase, urease, protease, acid
   phosphomonoesterase, P-glucosidase and arysulphatase activities.
   Different contents of organic C and total N between cultivated
   treatments and the forest soil indicated the extractive effect of

   Organic C presented significant correlations with most of the others

   dehydrogenase+0.4033 acid phosphomonoesterase+0.4916 beta-glucosidase)
   had a R-2 value which did not differ from that of the complete model.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term cultivation of soils for arable crops and without application
   of organic manure is thought to reduce the soil quality for crop
   production. We studied the porosity of two sandy loam soils from organic
   dairy farms with a ley cropping system and compared them with a
   conventionally managed dairy farm growing arable crops only and an
   arable soil receiving only mineral fertilizers, respectively. Saturated
   hydraulic conductivity, water retention characteristics, air diffusivity
   and air permeability were determined in the plough layer of the soil.
   The soil of one of the organic dairy farms contained many more earthworm
   burrows and had a significantly larger hydraulic conductivity than the
   counterpart soil of the conventionally managed dairy farm. In other
   respects, these two soils were much alike. The soil of the other
   organically managed dairy farm was less dense and had a larger volume of
   pores > 30 mum than the arable soil receiving only mineral fertilizers.
   A tube model was used to combine the air exchange measurements in a
   description of the soil pores. The pore system of the mineral fertilized
   soil consisted of continuous arterial pores with only a small volume of
   blocked and marginal pores embedded in the soil matrix next to the
   arterial pores. The porosity of the counterpart organic dairy farm soil
   had a considerable volume of blocked and especially marginal pores. The
   complexity of the latter was considered beneficial for local aeration in
   the soil and for derived soil properties such as fragmentation on
   tillage.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on soil organic matter (SOM) cycling in different climate zones
   are an important basis for further understanding of the feedback
   mechanism of terrestrial carbon storage to global climatic changes and
   are crucial for accurate projections of future concentrations of CO2 in
   the atmosphere. Using thin-layer methods, six soil profiles in the
   Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve (DHSBR), South China, and the Xiaoliang
   Ecological Station of the South China Institute of Botany, Chinese
   Academy of Sciences (CAS) were excavated and sampled for studies on the
   dynamics of SOM in the southern subtropical areas, based on SOM
   delta(13)C, Delta(14)C, Soil grain size characteristics, and soil
   organic carbon (SOC) contents. Results indicate that the turnover of SOM
   occurs in three stages: (i) Rapid turnover of SOM occurs within 100
   years, with SOC content decreasing sharply downwards from the ground
   surface and delta(13)C values becoming correspondingly enriched in C-13
   as a result of carbon isotope fractionation in the process of SOM
   turnover; maximum till is reached at about 260-270 years; (ii) from
   about 260-270 years to 800-1400 years, SOM turnover rates lessen, SOC
   content decreases slowly downwards, and delta(13)C values become
   gradually depleted in 13C due to the decomposition of SOM compartments
   with higher delta(13)C values; (iii) after about 1500 years, SOC content
   approaches the minimum, with slight fluctuations, and delta(13)C values
   become stable.
   Comparison analyses suggest that soil clay materials control existing
   forms and turnover processes of SOM directly, SOM in the soil sections
   with high clay content at DHSBR are not easily decomposed and have
   longer turnover periods, and soil textures are an important factor
   controlling SOM dynamics. Fall leaf litter generally has more negative
   delta(13)C value than the topsoil samples, which may be a result of
   isotope fractionation caused by rapid carbon decay prior to the
   penetration of carbon from the litter into the topsoils. Above-ground
   vegetation species and composition impact SOM turnover processes
   directly; delta(13)C analysis may be an important tool for determination
   of the improvement in soil quality during the restoration of degraded
   ecosystems. Vegetation occupation history also influences the SOM
   dynamics of soil profiles at different sites in one area with similar
   vegetation species, as shown by the soil profiles at the Xiaoliang
   Ecological Station of the South China Institute of Botany, CAS.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) in a series of
   soil samples originating from the municipality of Roskilde has been
   studied. The study includes soil samples from eight different locations
   with different histories: a preserved natural area that has not been
   cultured for 50-100 years, a soil that has been ecologically cultured
   for 40 years, a soil sustainably manured in ecologically culture for 5
   years (formerly conventionally cultured) and a soil that has been
   conventionally cultured using artificial fertilizer. In addition, a soil
   was studied that had been sludge amended by applying medium amounts of
   sludge as well as a soil that has been amended with high amounts of
   sludge for a 25-year period. In the latter case, the sludge amendment
   was abandoned 6 years before the first sampling, followed by the
   application of artificial fertilizers. Finally, a meadow in the run-off
   zone from a sludge storage area was included in the investigations. In
   addition to the soil samples, selected samples of the applied sludge and
   other fertilizers were analyzed for their possible content of LAS. Apart
   from the location where the soil had been heavily sludge-amended and the
   location situated in the run-off zone of the sludge storage,
   concentrations of LAS in all soil samples were found to be below
   approximately 1 mg/kg, which is well below the proposed preliminary soil
   quality criteria for LAS of 5 mg/kg. On the other hand, the study
   unambiguously disclosed that in the case of heavy sludge amendment, the
   proposed soil quality criteria might well be exceeded. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recent concerns about CO2 emissions and global warming have prompted
   renewed interest in using corn stover for energy production. Lack of
   markets, concerns about sustained soil productivity, and lack of
   commercial conversion technologies have spread harvest of corn residues
   for this purpose. This paper reviews existing literature to evaluate the
   major precluded the wide environmental impacts potentially associated
   with stover harvest from reduced tillage corn production sites. Issues
   of greatest concern are erosion and soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics,
   the latter both for its role in soil quality and yield and for global
   carbon cycle implications. About half of the literature examined
   concerned research in the United States, many publications described
   research activities conducted for decades, and major soil types in corn
   producing regions were well represented. Regional differences were
   primarily temperature and rainfall effects on stand establishment and
   yield, with potential feedback effects on SOC. Several research papers
   discussing the effects of residue harvest were found, but few field
   studies were found that explicitly studied the effects of corn stover
   harvest and most discussions acknowledge potential tradeoffs among
   beneficial and adverse effects. It was concluded that more information
   is needed on several topics to determine potential long-term effects of
   residue harvest, including (1) erosion and water quality, especially
   pesticides and nitrate, (2) rates of transformation of different forms
   of SOC, (3) effects on soil biota, and (4) SOC dynamics in the subsoil.

Abstract = {{Removing cover crop top growth in the spring for forage or to prevent
   incorporation problems is one management option. The effects of this
   residue management on soil quality and productivity need to be
   determined. This study, conducted from 1994 to 1998 at Puyallup, WA,
   determined effects of various winter cover crops and residue management
   on soil N availability, soil C and N, and corn (Zea mays L.) yield.
   Included in the study were monocultures of rye (Secale cereale L.),
   ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam), and vetch (Vicia villosa Roth subsp.
   villosa) and biculture of vetch and rye or ryegrass. Each year, the
   cover crops were seeded in the fall and incorporated into, or removed
   from, the soil in the spring. Average top-growth biomass was higher for
   the bicultures than for the monocultures. Total N accumulation was
   generally greatest under vetch, followed by the bicultures, and lowest
   for the monocultured rye or ryegrass. Whereas removing top growth of
   monocultured vetch or bicultures depressed presidedress soil NO3-N
   (N-i), the effect was generally not found for monocultured rye or
   ryegrass. Corn yields were affected by amounts of Ni and N fertilizer
   applied (r(2) > 0.789), irrespective of cover crop species and residue
   management. Removing top growth of the cover crops limited residue C
   input and reduced soil organic C and N after 5 yr. Soil organic C and N
   accumulation, as well as increasing soil C sequestration to reduce CO2
   release into atmosphere, should be considered when deciding which
   residue management option to choose.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the temporal variation of microbial biomass C,
   beta-glucosidase, acid phosphomonoesterase (acP), alkaline
   phosphomonoesterase (alP), and protease activity over 18 consecutive
   months. The likely causes for the seasonal variability at a non-degraded
   and a degraded site in south-western Nigeria were identified. Microbial
   biomass, alP, and beta-glucosidase activity were sensitive indicators of
   soil quality changes over time. Microbial biomass C correlated
   significantly with soil moisture conditions and soil organic
   matter-related parameters. AlP and beta-glucosidase activities were not
   controlled by climatic conditions over the course of two rainy seasons
   and one dry season but were temporally related to microbial biomass C
   and total C and N. Due to the steadiness of the alP activity over time
   the enzyme is considered a suitable indicator with which to monitor
   long-term changes of soil quality. Single sampling during the course of
   a year is adequate. Both microbial biomass and beta-glucosidase activity
   fluctuated highly. They were sensitive indicators to monitor short-term
   variations of soil quality with. Sampling for microbial biomass ought to
   be limited to the rainy seasons, whereas the measurement of
   beta-glucosidase activity need not be restricted seasonally. Due to the
   short-term variability found, sampling should be repeated. AcP and
   protease activity fluctuated highly during the course of a year and
   exhibited pronounced inter-seasonal differences. The marked seasonal
   changes could not be ascribed to soil moisture conditions and only
   poorly to major ecological C soil processes. This was more pronounced
   for acP than for protease. Hence, neither parameter was considered a
   sensitive and meaningful indicator of soil quality changes over time.}},

   2002. Soil fertility effects on carbon fluxes under two spring wheat
   rotations in a semiarid agroecosystem. Can, J. Soil Sci. 82: 155-163.
   Changes in soil C storage due to management practices are important in
   relation to soil quality and to the broader issue of atmospheric C
   sequestration. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of soil
   fertility management on C fluxes under two spring wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L.) rotations in semiarid southwestern Saskatchewan, i.e.,
   continuous wheat (Cont W) and a rotation that included summerfallow
   every third year (F-W-W). Continuous wheat was grown under two fertility
   regimes since initiation of the experiment in 1967, i.e., fertilization
   with N+P (no nutrient limitation) or with P only. In F-W-W there were
   three fertility treatments: N+P, N only, and P only. We measured soil
   CO2 emissions under all fertility treatments and rotation phases during
   the 1995 and 1996 cropping seasons (emissions were measured at about
   weekly intervals between spring and freeze-up in autumn). Inputs of C in
   straw were measured and a root:straw ratio of 0.59 was used to estimate
   root C inputs. Alleviation of nutrient limitations generally had a
   positive effect on wheat growth (and thus on C inputs), particularly in
   1995, the wetter of the 2 yr (precipitation 14\% greater than average).
   For example, C inputs in 1995 under Cont W were estimated at 2700 kg
   ha(-1) in the N+P treatment compared with 1500 kg ha(-1) in the P only
   treatment. Fertility treatments had little effect on CO2 emissions;
   e.g., for Cont W the mean flux for the 1995 monitoring period was 2.7
   mumol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) where N+P was applied and 2.6 mumol CO2 m(-2)
   s(-1) where P only was applied. Greater C inputs, but similar outputs of
   CO2-C for the N+P treatment vs. the systems receiving N or P only,
   suggest that proper fertilization resulted in a gain in soil C. However,
   quantifying the fertility-induced C gain is problematic because of
   uncertainty regarding effects of fertility on several components of the
   C budget, particularly root-C inputs and the contribution of rhizosphere
   respiration to the measured CO2 flux.}},

   intensive potato production in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada. Can.
   J. Soil Sci. 82: 249-258. Soil erosion by water associated with potato
   production in northwestern New Brunswick has been identified as one of
   the most severe soil degradation problems affecting soil quality in
   Canada. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness
   of applying various rates of hay mulch following potato (Solanum
   tuberosum L.) harvest in reducing runoff and soil loss rates under
   northwestern New Brunswick climatic and soil conditions and to determine
   the impact of the various hay mulch application rates on potato yield.
   Wischmeier-like runoff-erosion plots (10 in wide by 30 in long) on a
   Holmesville gravelly loam soil were used. Annual hay mulch application
   rates of 0.00, 2.25, 4.50 and 9.00 t ha(-1) wet mass were evaluated
   under continuous up-and-down-slope potato production on 8 and 11\%
   slopes between October 1995 and October 1999. During the study period,
   annual precipitation was lower than normal. Calculated rainfall
   erosivities were 102, 66, 73 and 133\% of the value typically used for
   conservation planning in this region (1276 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)),
   Seventy-three percent of the average annual erosivity for the 4-yr
   period was associated with storms occurring in June, July, August and
   September. Hay mulching at rates of 2,25, 4.50 and 9.00 t ha(-1)
   conserved on average 13, 18 and 28 mm of June to September
   precipitation, respectively. Mean annual soil losses were reduced to 14,
   7 and 2\% of the control (5.6 t ha(-1)) by the 2.25, 4.50 and 9.00 t
   ha(-1) treatments, respectively, on the 11\% slope and to 43 and 24\% of
   the control (2.0 t ha(-1)) on the 2.25 and 4.50 t ha(-1) treatments,
   respectively, on the 8\% slope. Eroded sediment silt, clay and organic
   matter (OM) contents were 1.6, 1.9 and 2.3 times the content of the
   surface soil at the experimental site. Mulching at rates as low as 2.25
   t ha(-1) reduced nutrient losses of NO3-N and available P, K, Ca and Mg
   to 26, 18, 28, 20 and 24\% of control, respectively, on the 11\% slope,
   and to 81, 50, 82, 66 and 77\% of control, respectively, on the 8\%
   slope. However, levels of nutrient losses from the controls were tow to
   begin with (2.0, 0.4, 2.8, 10.9 and 1.6 kg ha(-1) of NO3-N, and
   available P, K, Ca and Mg, respectively). Both total and marketable
   potato crop yields from all 2.25 and 4.50 t ha(-1) treatments were in
   excess of 5\% greater than their controls; however, only the increases
   in total yields from the 2.25 and 4.50 t ha(-1) treatments and
   marketable yield from the 4.50 t ha(-1) treatment on the 8\% slope were
   significantly greater at P < 0.05. Yield of potato on the 9.00 t ha(-1)
   treatment showed a consistent increase in total yield over the 4-yr
   period, going from 80\% of control in 1996 to 127\% of control in 1999,
   indicating a possible improvement in soil productivity. Hay mulching at
   rates up to 9.00 t ha(-1) did not increase the incidence of disease or
   other defects. Hay mulching was found to be an effective tool for
   reducing soil loss while maintaining, and in some cases enhancing,
   potato yield.}},

Abstract = {{In situ immobilization of heavy metals in contaminated soils is a
   technique to improve soil quality. Synthetic zeolites are potentially
   useful additives to bind heavy metals. This study selected the most
   effective zeolite in cadmium and zinc binding out of six synthetic
   zeolites (mordenite-type, faujasite-type, zeolite X, zeolite P, and two
   zeolites A) and one natural zeolite (clinoptilolite). Zeolite A appeared
   to have the highest binding capacity between pH 5 and 6.5 and was stable
   above pH 5.5. The second objective of this study, was to investigate the
   effects of zeolite addition on the dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   concentration. Since zeolites increase soil pH and bind Ca, their
   application might lead to dispersion of organic matter. In a batch
   experiment, the DOM concentration increased by a factor of 5 when the pH
   increased from 6 to 8 as a result of zeolite A addition. A strong
   increase in DOM was also found in the leachate of soil columns,
   particularly in the beginning of the experiment. This resulted in higher
   metal leaching caused by metal-DOM complexes. In contrast, the free
   ionic concentration of Cd and Zn strongly decreased after the addition
   of zeolites, which might explain the reduction in metal uptake observed
   in plant growth experiments. Pretreatment of zeolites with acid (to
   prevent a pH increase) or Ca (to coagulate organic matter) suppressed
   the dispersion of organic matter, but also decreased the metal binding
   capacity of the zeolites due to competition of protons or Ca.}},

Abstract = {{Soil C sequestration can improve soil quality and reduce agriculture's
   contribution to CO(2) emissions. The long-term (12 yr) effects of
   tillage system and N fertilization on crop residue production and soil
   organic C (SOC) sequestration in two dryland cropping systems in North
   Dakota on a loam soil were evaluated. An annual cropping (AC) rotation
   {[}spring wheat (SW) (Triticum aestivum L.)-winter wheat (WW)-sunflower
   (SF) (Helianthus annuus L.)] and a spring wheat-fallow (SW-F) rotation
   were studied. Tillage systems included conventional-till (CT),
   minimum-till (MT), and no-till (NT). Nitrogen rates were 34, 67, and 101
   kg N ha(-1) for the AC system and 0, 22, and 45 kg N ha(-1) for the SW-F
   system. Total crop residue returned to the soil was greater with AC than
   with SW-F. As tillage intensity decreased, SOC sequestration increased
   (NT > MT > CT) in the AC system but not in the SW-F system. Fertilizer N
   increased crop residue quantity returned to the soil, but generally did
   not increase SOC sequestration in either cropping system. Soil bulk
   density decreased with increasing tillage intensity in both systems. The
   results suggest that continued use of a crop-fallow farming system, even
   with NT, may result in loss of SOC. With NT, an estimated 233 kg C
   ha(-1) was sequestered each year in AC system, compared with 25 kg C
   ha(-1) with MT and a loss of 141 kg C ha(-1) with CT. Conversion from
   crop-fallow to more intensive cropping systems utilizing NT will be
   needed to have a positive impact on reducing CO(2) loss from croplands
   in the northern Great Plains.}},

Abstract = {{Unsuitable land use worldwide has led to environmental degradation. Land
   use effects on the environmental component of soil quality were assessed
   in 47 benchmark soils of three natural environments (Xerolls, Xerepts,
   and Cryepts) in southern Spain. Within each environment, soil groups
   with traditional land uses were compared with native sites. Soil quality
   changes were inferred by measuring the relative changes in chemical and
   physical soil properties. Irrigated terraces, rainfed cropland, and
   grassland, all within Xerepts, and grazed thyme scrub land were degraded
   with respect to native sites (significant differences at P < 0.05). In
   all cases, total porosity, macroporosity, and cation exchange capacity
   declined by more than 18\% (-0.11 cm(3) cm(-3)), 30\% (-0.11 cm(3)
   cm(-3)), and 48\% {[}-10.5 cmol(+) kg(-1)], respectively. Except in
   irrigated terraces, soil erodibility increased by as much as 59\% (+0.16
   USLE factor). Substantial losses of soil organic C (37\%, -14.7 Mg
   ha(-1)), available water (52\%, -36.2 mm), total N (65\%. -1.7 Mg
   ha(-1)), and rooting depth (68\%, -39 cm) were also observed in
   grassland and thyme scrub land. These changes suggest adverse effects on
   environmental protection functions of soil because of soil compaction
   and/or elimination of structural binding agents. Scanning electron
   microscopy images confirmed these morphological changes in
   microaggregates. Similar changes did not occur in cropland and grassland
   within Cryepts or in planted pine forest land. Reforestation with pine
   (Pinus nigra Arnold, Pinus sylvestris L., and Pinus uncinata Mill. ex
   Mirb.) provided organic cements and fungal hyphae that reinforce soil
   aggregation as well as ecologically valuable humus. Because cropland and
   grassland were able to recover the natural soil properties without human
   activity, we deduce that Cryepts are resilient.}},

Abstract = {{Higher plant growth tests are recommended to be used for testing soils
   and soil materials for their ecotoxicological properties. Soil samples
   from two different sites (LUFA Speyer Standard soil and BBA Berlin,
   Dahlem) were taken fresh from the field or from a storage site and used
   in the higher plant growth test, ISO 11269-2. Biomass response after a 3
   week growth period of oat (Avena sativa L.) and wild turnip (Brassica
   rapa ssp. rapa (DC.) Metzg.) was taken as test parameter to determine
   the influence of long term storage and various pre-treatments selected
   to prepare soil for being used as a control or reference soil. Tests
   were designed to allow for additional testing of microbial activity
   (dehydrogenase activity (DHA)), potential nitrification and supply of
   plant-available nitrogen (NO3-N content) in the test substrates. Soil
   stored for a long time period under air-dry conditions (BBA-soil) or at
   conditions maintaining a low moisture content (LUFA-soil) had low
   microbial activity but a sufficiently high level of plant-available
   nitrogen (NO3-N) and yielded good biomass increase after the growth
   period. Field soil used subsequently after sampling in the test had high
   microbial activity during the whole test period but low levels of NO3-N
   providing only low amounts of nitrogen available for the early growth
   stages of the test species, which in addition decreased rapidly over the
   test period due to uptake by the test plants and to the microbial
   activity. No significant differences were observed between fresh soil
   pretreated differently over a period of time and soil used immediately
   after sampling in the test if pre-treatment conditions were appropriate
   to maintain microbial activity. Spreading stored soil on a field plot
   and keeping it for at least 4 weeks under field conditions resulted in
   similar biomass response as found with soil sampled fresh from the
   field. The effect of storage on the result of a soil quality
   characterization essay is finally demonstrated. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sowing other crops in rotation with cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) has
   proven to be a successful strategy employed by farmers to reverse yield
   decline and maintain soil quality. The objectives of this study were to
   quantify soil macro-invertebrate abundance and composition with and
   without N fertiliser application during the wheat-cropping phase of a
   cotton-based rotational system. Comparison with invertebrate abundance
   was also made with an adjacent area of native vegetation. The experiment
   was first established in 1993, but invertebrate sampling was only
   conducted between June and December 1997, during the winter wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) phase at 6,15 and 23 weeks after planting (WAP)
   the crop and in nearby native vegetation at the same time. Ants were
   identified to genera and all other invertebrates to order. Changes in
   crop cover and soil temperature were also evaluated at 6, 15 and 23 WAR
   Ant abundance was higher in the treatments where N fertiliser was not
   applied, but only later in the season (summer), compared to the
   treatments where N fertiliser was applied. Other invertebrates showed a
   similar pattern of recovery to ants, with higher levels of abundance in
   summer compared with earlier in the wheat growing cycle. The use of ants
   as bioindicators for monitoring changes in soil health within
   cotton-based rotational systems, especially in the wheat-cropping phase,
   is complicated by the confounding factor of seasonality, although their
   fluctuations in abundance mimic other invertebrates. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Grazing in fall and early winter decreases the cost of beef production
   in southwestern Saskatchewan. This grazing system can be improved by
   utilizing legume and native shrub species, which exhibit high nutritive
   value in the fall. To realize the system's full potential, a better
   understanding of optimum mixtures of legumes and shrubs is required. A
   greenhouse study was conducted to optimize mixtures of legumes and
   shrubs for economical pasture production. The first goal was to obtain
   better understanding of synergy from mixtures of legumes and native
   shrubs. The second goal was to estimate the changes in soil quality
   caused by growing legumes and shrubs in monocultures or mixtures. Legume
   species studied were: alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (Alf), purple prairie
   clover {[}Petalostemon purpureum (Vert.) Rydb] (Pr Cl) and American
   vetch (Vicia americana Muhl.) (Vetch); shrubs were: winterfat
   {[}Krascheninnikovia lanata (Pursh) Guldenstaedt] (Wf) and Gardner's
   saltbush {[}Atriplex gardneri (Moq.) D. Dietr.] (Sb). Treatments
   consisted of five monocultures, six mixtures and a control. Data on
   plant biomass, forage quality and soil quality parameters indicate that
   legume and shrub mixtures of Alf + Wf and/or Alf + Sb can potentially
   provide diversified forage sources, extended grazing periods and higher
   or similar yields with enhanced or similar forage quality than when
   grown separately.}},

Abstract = {{During the past 50 yr, ecological and agricultural scientists have
   pursued an integrated definition and metric of soil quality. In the past
   20 yr, considerable attention has been paid to nematodes, demonstrating
   that these ubiquitous members of the soil community reflect change in
   ecological structure and function of soils in ways more predictable and
   efficient than for other soil flora or fauna. With the help of
   multivariate analysis, we studied the application of free-living
   nematode communities as model indicators of physical and chemical
   disturbance of agricultural soil. We used canonical correspondence
   analysis (CCA) and partial CCA to segregate effects of tillage and
   chemical/nutrient treatments. With the results of CCA, we assigned
   relative direct and indirect tillage sensitivity and chemical/nutrient
   sensitivity ratings to soil genera found in two test data sets, each
   containing three matrices: (1) sites by species or genera, (2) sites by
   soil properties, and (3) sites by management practices. Of 46 total
   genera, the ones most sensitive to direct effects of tillage include
   Aphelenchoides, Eucephalobus, Eudorylaimus, Heterocephalobus, and
   Wilsonema compared to the tolerant genera Achromadora, Anatonchus,
   Cephalobus, Chiloplacus, Clarkus, Epidorylaimus, Mylonchulus, Plectus,
   and Tylencholaimellus. Some genera are more sensitive to indirect than
   direct effects of tillage: these include Achromadora, Cephalobus,
   Microdorylaimus, Monhystera, Panagrolaimus, and Prionchulus. With the
   exception of Discolaimus and Prismatolaimus, genera sensitive to
   chemical/nutrient treatments differ from those sensitive to tillage
   treatments including Alaimus, Cylindrolaimus, Mesorhabditis,
   Odontolaimus, and Protorhabditis. Likewise, genera uniquely sensitive to
   indirect but not direct effects of chemical/nutrient treatments are
   Aphelenchus, Aporcelaimellus. and Diplogaster. Eudorylaimus and
   Eumonhsytera are sensitive to indirect effects of both tillage and
   chemical/nutrient treatments. Our results suggest that physical and
   chemical/nutrient disturbances can alter populations of nematode genera
   differently, and that indirect effects of management are greater than
   direct effects. This methodology aids in distinguishing nematode genera
   that have distinctive responses to agricultural management practices
   from those that are ambiguous. This knowledge is useful for both
   interpretation and enhancement of free-living nematode community
   indices.}},

Abstract = {{J. MEISEL. N. TRUSHENSKI AND E. WEIHER (Department of Biology,

   analysis of oak savanna community composition in western Wisconsin, J.
   Torrey Bot. Soc. 129: 1 15-124. 2002. Oak savannas were historically
   abundant, but they are now rare. Although there is great interest in oak
   savanna restoration, there is still debate about the nature of the
   understory composition of oak savannas, especially in lowlands. We
   sampled 168 quadrats (0.25 m(2)) in remnant floodplain oak savannas
   along the Chippewa River, WI, to produce a gradient analysis of
   vegetation by both taxonomic and guild composition. Community
   composition varied along two main gradients, as indicated by
   correlations between DCA scores and environmental factors. The
   communities mainly varied along a soil quality gradient (primarily
   nitrogen and organic matter), from sand barrens to wet-mesic savannas.
   and along a tree canopy cover gradient from open prairie-like areas to
   areas with heavy canopy, Although significant, fire frequency was of
   minor importance, but we believe this was partly a sampling artifact.
   Seven general community types were described, and MANOVA tests showed
   they differed in terms of guild composition. Forbs tended to dominate
   most community types. with Solidago species usually among the most
   abundant species. while C4 graminoids (mostly Andropogon gerardii and
   Sarghastrum nutans) were dominant only in the poorest soils and
   relatively open areas. Stepwise regression showed relatively weak
   relationships between relative guild cover and the measured
   environmental variables. Only C4 graminoids showed close correspondence
   to the main gradients affecting taxonomic composition. The other guilds
   responded to disturbance and distinct soil factors.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The only trees in most of the Negev desert are 3 native Acacia species.
   We tested the hypothesis that they act as keystone species as a result
   of the improved soil conditions under their canopies. Furthermore,
   because many Acacia populations suffer high levels of mortality due to
   water stress, we tested whether trees in high mortality populations had
   diminished effects on plant species and soil quality under their
   canopies. We show that plant species diversity beneath the tree canopies
   is higher than in the surrounding areas. There was also a clearly
   identifiable suite of species with higher occurrence under the trees.
   Plant species composition differed significantly between high and low
   mortality sites. However, there was higher species diversity in high
   mortality sites and under trees with higher water stress. Soil nutrient
   content was higher under the trees than in the open areas, especially
   under larger trees and trees with higher water status. The results
   indicate that there is a combination of positive and negative effects of
   Acacia trees on the under-canopy environment, which may include positive
   effects of higher soil nutrients and a negative influence of higher soil
   salinity.}},

Abstract = {{Through the use of safety factors, the use of single-species test data
   has been adequate for use in protective hazard assessments and criteria
   setting but, because hazard quotients do not consider the presence of
   multiple species each with a particular sensitivity or the interactions
   that can occur between these species in a functioning community, they
   are ill-suited to environmental risk assessment. Significant functional
   redundancy occurs in most ecosystems but this is poorly considered in
   single-species tests conducted under laboratory conditions. A
   significant advance in effects assessment was the use of the microcosm
   as a unit within which to test interacting populations of organisms. The
   microcosm has allowed the measurement of the environmental effect
   measures such as the NOAEC(community) under laboratory or field
   conditions and the application of this and other similarly derived
   measures to ecological risk assessment (ERA). More recently,
   distributions of single-species laboratory test data have been used for
   criteria setting and, combined with distributions of exposure
   concentrations, for risk assessment. Distributions of species
   sensitivity values have been used in an a priori way for setting
   environmental quality criteria such as the final acute value (FAV)
   derived for water quality criteria. Similar distributional approaches
   have been combined with modeled or measured concentrations to produce
   estimates of the joint probability of a single species being affected or
   that a proportion of organisms in a community will be impacted in a
   posteriori risk assessments. These techniques have not been widely
   applied for risk assessment of dredged materials, however, with
   appropriate consideration of bioavailability and spatial and nature of
   the data these techniques can be applied to soils and sediments. (C)

Abstract = {{The disappearance of dichloromethane-extractable organic C (DEO-C) from
   hydrocarbon-contaminated soil is seldom fully accounted for by the
   evolution of CO2. An oil-contaminated soil was spiked with C-14
   n-octadecane and a creosote-contaminated soil with C-14
   {[}4,5,9,10]pyrene to test the hypothesis that contaminant C is
   redistributed among soil C fractions during bioremediation. The soils
   were incubated for 12 months and destructively analyzed at one week, two
   weeks, one month, and thereafter monthly. The soil fractions examined
   were biomass-C (BC), humic-C (HC), and water soluble-C (WSC). Humin-C
   (HNC) was calculated as C-14(total) minus the sum of direct measurements
   of the other C fractions. Labeled CO2 and volatile organic C (VOC) were
   collected and measured. The data provide a series of `snapshots' of the
   transformations of contaminant-C in each soil. VOC was insignificant and
   for both soils 47-50\% of the applied C-14 was recovered in the evolved
   CO2 only after three months incubation. The primary fate of C from the
   labeled organic Compounds ill both soils was into the humic-C and
   humin-C fractions; in some cases as much as 50\% of the applied C-14 was
   recovered from these fractions. Neither BC nor WSC were significant
   fates of the C-14 during this incubation, and in combination did not
   exceed 12\% of the total C-14 applied in each soil. Enrichment of the
   humic-C and humin-C with contaminant-derived C poses interesting
   questions regarding the end point of bioremediation, traditionally total
   removal of the contaminant. Metabolism of the C to other fractions is
   clearly an alternate possibility. Furthermore, the fractions enriched
   may actually be those considered beneficial to soil quality, Such as
   humic and humin-C. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, crop rotation and no-till farming have become common
   practices in Alberta and are widely recommended to maintain and/or
   enhance soil quality for sustained crop production, and improve
   environmental quality. This study was under-taken to evaluate the
   effects of canola (Brassica rapa L.) and field pea (Pisum sativum L.) as
   replacements for summer fallow on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
   production, and to determine the role of tillage (no-till versus
   modified no-till) on crop production on an Albright silt loam (Mollic
   Cryoboralf) near Beaverlodge, Alta. Spring wheat was grown for 2 years
   of the 3-year cropping cycle. Crop sequences studied were:
   canola-wheat-wheat (CWW), field pea-wheat-wheat (PWW) and
   fallow-wheat-wheat (FWW). The control was continuous wheat, i.e.
   wheat-wheat-wheat or monoculture wheat (MW). In modified no-till sweeps
   attached to the seed drill pushed crop residues aside from the centre
   7.5 cm of the seed row. Wheat yield following field pea increased by an
   average (1997-1999) of 10.5\% as compared to monoculture wheat. Our data
   showed no measurable effect of canola on succeeding wheat yields as
   compared to monoculture wheat. Wheat yields following fallow were
   intermediate between the CWW and PWW cropping systems. Residue
   management through the modified no-till system resulted in a warmer
   seedbed during spring and improved wheat production in all crop
   rotations studied, especially the first succeeding wheat. Modified
   no-till also resulted in higher yields of canola but not pea. Our data
   indicate that in a 3-year rotation with wheat the preferred break crop
   would be field pea for the cold semi-arid region of Alberta, Canada. (C)

Abstract = {{In the Sahel, poor soil quality and rainfall levels have a great
   influence on pasture production and hence on secondary output. In areas
   where rainfall is the limiting factor for primary production, recovery
   of primary and secondary production after the dry season depends on soil
   type. On sandy soils a large fraction of rainfall infiltrates and
   becomes available for plant growth, stimulating fast herbage growth,
   while on clayey and loamy soils low infiltration rates generate runoff,
   leading to slower herbage growth rates. The very different moisture
   retention characteristic of sands and clays is another possible cause
   for the observed differences in growth rates. lit this paper we
   investigate the herbage growth rate from the onset of the rainy season.
   We hypothesise that, in areas where rainfall is the limiting factor for
   primary production. the vegetation growth rate on clayey soils is lower
   than that on sandy soils. We will test this hypothesis using long-term
   rainfall, soil types and satellite derived normalised difference
   vegetation index data. This research shows that the growth rates on
   sandy soil are significantly greater than that on clayey soils during
   the early part of the rainy season. We also show that these differences
   can be detected at large scales using satellite imagery. We also
   conclude that, at this scale, movement strategies of pastoralists would
   be intrinsically linked to not only rainfall patterns and distribution.
   but also to the underlying soil types in the region as this affects the
   quality and quantity of fodder available. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The development of low-input farming systems requires knowledge of the
   extent to which management characteristics influence the soil as a
   habitat for micro-organisms and a medium for plant growth. This paper
   presents a study of long-term effects of organically and conventionally
   cultivated systems on a range of soil physical, chemical and biological
   characteristics in Denmark. Seven soils were included, falling into
   three groups (I-III). Each group consists of an organically managed soil
   (Org) referenced by one or two conventionally managed soils (Conv) with
   the same soil type (sandy loam) and pedological history. All organically
   managed soils were dairy farm soils (H), which had been organically
   managed for 46, 47 and 40 years, respectively. They had forage crop
   rotations and received animal manure. The conventional soils were either
   dairy farm soils or soils grown to annual cash crops (P). Undisturbed
   core samples were used for assessing dry bulk density and water
   retention. Undisturbed cubic samples were used for assessing wet
   stability of macro-aggregates, clay dispersibility, microbial biomass C,
   beta-glucosidase activity, ergosterol, and the abundance of different
   groups of fungi. Penetration resistance and ease of soil fragmentation
   were measured in the field. The quantifying methods were supplemented by
   a visual inspection of soil structure of the top 30 cm soil in the held.
   Irrespective of agricultural system, the use of tractors and heavy
   machinery had caused compaction of the subsoil in the form of a dense
   pan below ploughing depth. In group I, the H-soils were heavily
   trafficked and this overshadowed the long-term effects of the
   diversified crop rotations and animal manure applications on the
   physical parameters. Generally, the results highlight the paramount
   influence of soil tillage and traffic in agriculture. Further, the
   results confirm the positive effects of organic manures and diversified
   crop rotations on soil quality aspects. Microbial biomass C was found to
   be higher in organically than in conventionally managed dairy farm
   soils, and appeared to correlate linearly to the volume of 0.2-3.0 mum
   pores ('protective' pore space). The simple model did, however, not
   explain a lower microbial biomass for two soils dressed only with
   synthetic fertilisers. The results further indicated that the
   contribution of the different biotic mechanisms responsible for
   macro-aggregation varied from soil to soil. The results revealed
   promising correlations between quantitative scientific laboratory
   methods and descriptive methods in the field. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The impacts of recent changes in cropping systems in the northern Great
   Plains on nutrient dynamics are described in this review paper. Cropping
   intensity and diversity are increasing in the Great Plains because
   reduced tillage systems have improved water conservation and,
   subsequently, crop yields. Higher annualized crop yields increase
   nutrient removal which must be balanced by increased nutrient inputs to
   ensure optimal crop yield and quality. while avoiding soil depletion.
   Furthermore, diversification of crops alters the pattern and degree of
   nutrient removal and influences microbiological activity and soil
   quality. Although cropping intensification and diversification will
   influence most plant nutrients, N and P are the nutrients most commonly
   deficient for crop production in the Great Plains and most likely to be
   affected by management practices. Cropping intensification increases
   crop residue return to the soil, which in turn increases the soil
   organic C pool. This can lead to higher soil organic matter levels and a
   greater potential for nutrient cycling, an effect that will increase
   with time. Cropping systems that include legumes have the potential for
   contributing N to following crops and may moderate NO3 levels in the
   soil to avoid potential for NO3 leaching. Phosphorus availability may be
   influenced by depletion or accumulation of P, based on past cropping and
   fertilizer management. In addition, preceding crop may influence P
   availability through residue effects and impacts on
   vesicular-arbus-cular mycorrhizae activity. Synchrony of nutrient supply
   with crop demand is essential in order to ensure optimum crop yield and
   quality while avoiding negative environmental impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Cultivated forage crops are grown on almost 12 million ha on the
   northern Great Plains. This paper reviews the benefits of diversifying
   annual crop rotations with forage crops and highlights innovations in
   forage systems. Agronomic benefits of rotating forage crops with annual
   grain crops include higher grain crop yields following forages (up to 13
   yr in one study), shifts in the weed population away from arable crop
   weeds, and improved soil quality. Perennial legumes in rotation also
   reduce energy requirements by adding significant amounts of N to the
   soil. Soil water availability may limit the extent to which forages
   benefit following crops. Under semiarid conditions, forages can actually
   reduce yields of the following crops, and as such, tillage practices
   that conserve soil water have been developed to partially address this
   problem. Forages in rotation provide environmental benefits, such as C
   sequestration, critical habitat for wildlife, and reduced NO., leaching.
   A wider range of annual plant species are now used in forage systems in
   an effort to extend the grazing season and to maximize use of water
   resources. Intensive pasture management using cultivated forages is on
   the increase as is the use of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) in grazing
   systems, in some cases, bloat-reduced alfalfa cultivars are used.
   Pasture-based systems appear to provide benefits for both animal and
   human health and arguably the health of the environment. Pasture systems
   are less nutrient exhausting than hay systems. As a result, nutrient
   management strategies will differ in the following crop. Additional
   research is required to optimize the role of cultivated pastures in
   grain-based cropping systems.}},

Abstract = {{Plant root mucilage is known to enhance soil quality by contributing
   towards the soil carbon pool, soil aggregation, detoxification of heavy
   metal ions and interactions with rhizospheric microflora. Mucilage
   consists of many monosaccharide units, including fucose which can be
   used as an indicator for plant root based polysaccharides. This is the
   first report of an immunological technique developed to use anti-fucose
   antibodies as markers for probing and localizing fucosyl residues in
   mucilage polysaccharide and, in turn, for localization of plant root
   mucilage. Fucose was complexed with bovine serum albumin to raise
   antibodies against fucose. A fucose-directed antibody was shown to
   cross-react with root cap mucilages from grasses. This antibody was used
   to localize root mucilage polysaccharide in maize and wheat root caps
   using immunogold electron microscopy. Abundant labelling could be
   localized on the cell wall, and in the intercellular matrix and vesicles
   of the peripheral root cap cells. Labelling was less intense in cells
   towards the centre of the root cap tissue. Control experiments confirmed
   that immuno-old localization of fucose was specific and reliable. (C)

Abstract = {{For the past two decades, the Taiwan Environmental Protection
   Administration has made a systematic investigation of As, Cd, Cr, Cu,
   Pb, Hg, Ni and Zn in agricultural soils to identify soil pollution from
   industrial production. The EPA has cooperated with local governmental
   agencies to establish a soil quality monitoring system that would
   upgrade the land recovery ability and prohibit polluted lands from being
   cultivated or turned over to other uses. Based on an island-wide soil
   survey, more than 1,000 hectares of arable soils in Taiwan were found to
   be considerably contaminated by heavy metals. One of the heavy metal
   contaminated sites, located near a ceramic product manufacturing factory
   in Nantou County, was identified as lead contaminated. According to the
   Nantou Environmental Protection Bureau, the lead content in contaminated
   sites showed a great variation of several `mg Pb kg(-1) soil' to several
   thousands `mg Pb kg(-1) soil'. Therefore, it is appropriate to estimate
   the lead spatial distribution through geostatistics such as Kriging. The
   soil lead concentration contour maps obtained by Kriging can help us to
   identify the pollution patterns and delineate the range of contaminated
   sites. The purpose of this study is to determine the Pb concentrations
   at each location by performing detailed soil sampling on those Pb
   contaminated sites and estimating the lead spatial distributions by
   Kriging. A total of 70 soils were sampled from different locations at
   two experiment sites. Lead contents were determined with 0.1 M HCl
   extractable lead content of the soils. The results obtained by
   investigating the lead contents in each 15 cm segment down to a 60 cm
   depth, revealed that lead contents were greater in arable land near the
   ceramic products manufacturing factory, and lead concentrations
   decreased with depth. In addition, Pb concentrations in heavily
   contaminated soils showed heavy concentrations of Pb in specific
   locations. Results from Pb content spatial distributions indicated that
   the Kriging model is a useful tool and can provide decision-makers with
   critical information for delineating hazardous areas in heavy metal
   contaminated sites.}},

Abstract = {{Morphometric measurements of the volume fractions (V(v)) of two
   prominent metal-sequestering compartment, chloragosome granules and
   debris vesicles, were made on transmission electron micrographs of
   chloragocytes in Dendrodrilus rubidus (Annelida: Oligochaeta:
   Lumbricidae) from one uncontaminated site and three qualitatively and
   quantitatively different metalliferous soils associated with disused
   Pb/Zn mines. We also examined the relative volume fractions of the
   alimentary wall and attached chloragogenous tissue by light microscopy.
   Several conclusions relevant to environmental diagnostics were reached:
   Metal identity and degree of soil pollution exert strong effects on
   chloragocyte ultrastructure; morphometry by light microscopy indicated
   that the metal-induced structural effects are characterized by
   intracellular alterations not accompanied by a significant expansion of
   the tissue volume; elevated metal burdens can reduce chloragosome V,
   and, concomitantly, increase the V(v) of their autophagic derivatives,
   the debris vesicles; the measured cellular alterations were more closely
   correlated with integrated tissue metal burdens than the were with
   integrated soil metal burdens; and estimates of tissue metal
   distribution, derived by combining morphometric data and published
   whole-worm and chloragosome metal concentrations, suggested that the
   alimentary wall of earthworms may sequester Pb, Zn, and Cd. Our study
   shows that cellular changes, directly or indirectly, may yield
   quantifiable expressions of metal loads bioaccumulated by earthworms.
   However, the practical use of cellular changes as biomarkers of soil
   quality probably will require automated light-microscopic morphometry in
   combination with organelle-specific molecular probes to be cost
   effective.}},

Abstract = {{Current concern for soil quality has stimulated research on soil
   biological and chemical properties. In contrast, the mechanical
   behaviour of soil is somewhat neglected. We have examined the effects on
   soil mechanical properties of more than 100 years of contrasting
   fertilization employing three treatments from the Askov long-term
   experiment: UNF (unfertilized), NPK (mineral fertilized) and AM (animal
   manured. We have measured tensile strength of aggregates when air-dry
   and when adjusted to -10, -30 and -100 kPa pressure potential. Four
   aggregate size classes were investigated (1-2, 2-4, 4-8 and 8-16 mm
   diameter). Soil fragmentation was characterized in the field using a
   drop-shatter test. Bulk soil strength was determined in the field using
   a shear vane and a torsional shear box. Soil texture, pH, cation
   exchange capacity and microbial biomass were measured. The unfertilized
   soil has little soil organic matter and microbial biomass and is dense.
   Its aggregates were strong when dry and weak when wet. In contrast, the
   manured soil had strong aggregates when wet and rather weak ones when
   dry. The NPK soil generally had intermediate properties. The differences
   between the soils when dry seem to be related to differences in
   dispersible clay content, whereas the differences when wet are related
   to differences in the amount of organic binding and bonding material.
   The optimal water content for tillage as well as the tolerable range in
   water content was largest in the manured soil and smallest in the
   unfertilized soil. Our results indicate that soil mechanical properties
   should be measured over a range of water regimes to determine the
   effects of various long-term fertilization treatments.}},

   of good soil-management practices. To characterize the effects of
   different management practices, molecular indicators such as
   phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA). denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
   (DGGE) and composition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria were used to
   analyze bacterial community structure and diversity from four eastern
   Washington State soils. Samples from four sites were collected
   representing a transect of high-precipitation to low-precipitation areas
   that covered different agronomic zones with different management and
   cropping practices. Biomass amounts estimated from extractable PLFA were
   significantly higher in the no-till (NT) soil than in the
   conventional-till (CT) soil. Similarities among the different 16S rDNA
   DGGE band profiles were analyzed quantitatively using correspondence
   analysis and this confirmed that the CT soil was the most dissimilar
   soil. DGGE analysis of 16S rDNA ammonia-oxidizing bacteria from the four
   soils revealed two identical bands, indicating little effect of
   agronomic practices and precipitation on these species. A second set of
   primers. specific for amoA (ammonia monooxygenase) genes, was used to
   examine ammonia oxidizers in the samples. Six banding patterns
   (clusters) from amplified rDNA restriction analysis of 16S rDNA
   fragments were observed after restriction analysis with HinfI.
   Sequencing of these clones revealed the presence of only
   Nitrosospira-like sequences. Analysis of the sequences showed that
   ammonia oxidizers from the NT soil were more diverse compared to those
   from the CT and conservation reserve program soils. Our data showed that
   management and agronomic practices had more impact on bacterial
   community structure than annual precipitation. (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {{Sustainable resource management is one of the most complex concerns
   today. Society has spent billions of dollars conserving soils in
   production, yet it is unclear whether these efforts buy sustainability,
   or even what sustainability is. Further study about which soils need
   conservation merits consideration. We use a simulation model,
   regression, and optimization analysis to examine the sustainability of
   resource management in objective, measurable ways. Soil quality,
   represented by a new index, and other nonirrigated corn production data
   are placed into a dynamic model to identify: 1) the conditions where
   soil conservation is efficient, and 2) under what definitions
   conservation is sustainable. Results show that decisions to use or
   conserve soil and the impacts of these decisions are highly dependent
   upon soil type and how sustainability is defined. In general, while soil
   conservation slowed degradation on erodible soils, it seemed to be more
   effective and economically efficient the better the initial quality of
   the soil. This calls into question whether U.S. conservation policy that
   focuses on marginal soils supports sustainability. Economic research was
   undertaken to study which soils might best be targeted for conservation,
   using economic and sustainability criteria. An economic model of
   nonirrigated corn production was created to determine-under requirements
   of maintaining a certain level of production or maintaining soil
   quality-if, when, and where it was best to apply conservation practices.
   Results show that decisions to use or conserve soil and the impacts of
   these decisions are highly dependent upon the characteristics of the
   soil and how sustainability is defined. In general, white soil
   conservation slowed degradation on erodible soils, it seemed to be more
   effective and economically efficient the better the initial soil
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. We draw on ecological modernization theory and international
   political economy arguments to examine the sources of an environmental
   Kuznets curve (or EKC) that produces an inverted U-shaped rate of
   deforestation relative to economic development. Method. We use ordinary
   least squares regression with White's ( 1978) correction Cor possible
   heteroskedasticity to examine the rate of deforestation (1980-1995) in
   less developed countries. Results. Net of controls for initial forest
   stock and the quality of deforestation estimates, we find strong
   evidence for an EKC driven by (1) agglomeration effects linked to the
   level of urbanization, (2) rural-to-urban migration that partially
   offsets rural population pressure, (3) the growth of services-dominated
   urban economies, and (4) strong democratic states. We Find little
   evidence that foreign debt or export dependence influence the
   deforestation rate. Conclusions. Although deforestation continues to
   pose pressing and potentially irreversible environmental risks, there is
   evidence of self-corrective ecological and modernization processes
   inherent in development that act to mitigate these risks.
   Deforestation is a pressing environmental problem involving permanent
   loss of species, soil degradation, impact on global climate change, and
   long-term resource depletion. Of the approximately 3.4 billion hectares
   of forest land that existed around the globe in 1980, approximately 5
   percent had been cleared by 1995 (FAO, 1997). Although some decline in
   the rate of deforestation has been detected in the 1990s (with rapid
   deforestation in some regions being offset by uneven decreases in Brazil
   and reforestation in some developed nations), there is no guarantee of
   abatement in the near future (World Resources Institute, 2000). Given
   the inextricable links between forest cover and biodiversity, soil
   quality, and atmospheric replenish-ment, understanding the causes and
   consequences of deforestation must be central to both natural and social
   environmental science.
   Of the various forms of environmental degradation, deforestation holds a
   special appeal because (1) the felling of trees is spatially fixed and
   therefore more amenable to study, (2) deforestation is unambiguously due
   to human activities, and (3) the loss of forest cover is uniquely
   intertwined with nearly all other forms of environmental degradation.
   This article extends and improves on prior cross-national analyses of
   deforestation. Whereas most past studies have been empirical and
   descriptive, more recent investigations have been more theoretical,
   emphasizing modernization processes, demographic pressures, and
   dependency/world systems constraints (e.g., Rock, 1996; Rudel and Roper,
   1997; Ehrhardt-Martinez, 1998, 1999). As a part of this theorizing, the
   existence and implications of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) have
   garnered increasing attention. Given that the actual meaning of this
   curvilinear relationship between development and deforestation depends
   heavily on the intervening mechanisms linking the two, the purpose of
   this investigation is first to establish the existence of an EKC for
   deforestation and then to examine various competing explanations for
   this pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Soil physical condition following tillage influences crop yield, but the
   desired condition cannot be adequately evaluated with current
   techniques. This study was conducted to determine a soil condition index
   (SCI) that could be used to select the type of implement needed to
   achieve an optimal seedbed with minimum energy input. Effects of bulk
   density, moisture content, and penetration resistance resulting from
   three tillage systems (no-till, chisel plow and moldboard plow), on the
   growth of corn (Zea mays L.) were studied. The experiment was conducted
   in Boone County, Ames, IA, on soils that are mostly Aquic Hapludolls,
   Typic Haplaquolls and Typic Hapludolls with slopes ranging from 0 to
   5\%. The results are from the 2000 season, which had normal weather
   conditions and yield levels for the Iowa state. The average corn grain
   yield at this site was 9.36 Mg/ha. At the V2 cor growth stage, the
   average dry biomass was 1.34 g per plant. The soil physical properties
   were normalized with respect to reference values and combined via
   multiple regression analysis against corn biomass at V2 stage into the
   SCI. Mean SCI values for the no-till, chisel and moldboard plow
   treatments were 0.86, 0.76, and 0,73, respectively, all with a standard
   error of 0.0127. The lower the SCI, the more optimum the soil physical
   conditions. An analysis of variance showed significant differences among
   mean SCI for each treatment (p-value = 0.001). The use of the SO could
   improve the tillage decision-making process in environments similar the
   one studied. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) and its different pools have key importance in
   optimizing crop production, minimizing negative environmental impacts,
   and thus improving soil quality. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate the soil C and N contents in bulk soil and in different SOM
   pools (light and heavy fractions) of a clayey Rhodic Ferralsol after 13
   years of different tillage and crop rotations in Passo Fundo, State of
   Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from no-tillage
   (no soil disturbance except for sowing; NT) and conventional tillage
   (disc plough followed by light disc harrowings; CT) applied to
   wheat/soybean (W/S) and wheat/soybean-vetch/maize (W/S-V/M) rotations.
   As reference, soil was sampled from a non-cultivated area adjacent to
   the field experiment. The greatest soil C and N contents were found in
   non-cultivated soils in the 05 cm depth (45 a C kg(-1) soil and 3.6 g N
   kg(-1) soil). Crop cultivation led to a decrease in SOM content which
   was higher for CT soils (approx. 60\% decrease in C and N contents) than
   NT soils (approx. 43\% decrease in C and N contents) at 0-5 cm. Tillage
   had the greatest impact on soil C and N storage. Soils under NT did not
   contain higher C and N storage than CT soils below 5 cm depth.
   Significantly, higher amounts of organic carbon of FLF in CT (0.5-0.7 g
   C kg(-1) soil) than in NT soils (0.2 g C kg(-1) soil) at 10-210 cm depth
   were also observed and the differences in C and N storage between CT and
   NT soils in the 0-30 cm layer were not significant. Silt and clay
   fractions contained the largest amount of organic carbon (60-95\%) of
   total organic carbon), and free light fraction was the most sensitive
   pool of organic carbon to detect changes in SOM due to soil tillage and
   crop rotations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in the quality and health of soil has been stimulated by recent
   awareness that soil is vital to both production of food and fiber and
   global ecosystems function. Soil health, or quality, can be broadly
   defined as the capacity of a living soil to function, within natural or
   managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity,
   maintain or enhance water and air quality, and promote plant and animal
   health. Soil quality and health change over time due to natural events
   or human impacts. They are enhanced by management and land-use decisions
   that weigh the multiple functions of soil and are impaired by decisions
   which focus only on single functions, such as crop productivity.
   Criteria for indicators of soil quality and health relate mainly to
   their utility in defining ecosystem processes and in integrating
   physical, chemical, and biological properties, their sensitivity to
   management and climatic variations, and their accessibility and utility
   to agricultural specialists, producers, conservationists, and policy
   makers. Although soils have an inherent quality as related to their
   physical, chemical, and biological properties within the constraints set
   by climate and ecosystems, the ultimate determinant of soil quality and
   health is the land manager. As such, the assessment of soil quality or
   health, and direction of change with time, is the primary indicator of
   sustainable management. Scientists can make a significant contribution
   to sustainable land management by translating scientific knowledge and
   information on soil function into practical tools and approaches by
   which land managers can assess the sustainability of their management
   practices. The first steps, however, in our communal journey towards
   sustainable land management must be the identification of our final
   destination (sustainability goals), the strategies or course by which we
   will get there, and the indicators (benchmarks) that we are proceeding
   in the right direction. We too often rush to raise the sails of our
   `technological' ship to catch the wind, before knowing from where it
   comes or in property defining our destination, charting our course, and
   setting the rudder of our ship. Examples are given of approaches for
   assessing soil quality and health to define the sustainability of land
   management practices and to `translate our science into practice'. (C)

Abstract = {{Existing definitions of ``soil quality{''} and ``sustainable land
   management{''} are analysed to derive a procedure for defining land
   quality (LQ) indicators of sustainable land management. Land - rather
   than soil qualities are considered to reflect the impact of the climate
   on soil behaviour. LQ is different for different types of land use and
   attention is arbitrarily confined here to agriculture. Simulation
   modelling of crop growth and solute fluxes is used to define LQ as the
   ratio between a conditioned crop yield and potential yield x 100. The
   actual agro-ecological condition and its potential, both expressed by LQ
   for a given piece of land, is considered here as independent input into
   broader land-use discussions which tend to be dominated by
   socio-economic and political considerations. Agro-ecological
   considerations should not be held hostage to actual socio-economic and
   political considerations which may change in the near future while the
   LQ has a much more permanent character. The proposed LQ reflects yields,
   risks of production as simulations are made for many years, and soil and
   water quality associated with the production process. The latter are
   expressed here in an exploratory manner for seven tropical soils and in
   more detail for Dutch conditions in terms of the probability that
   groundwater is polluted with nitrates, reflecting the most dominant
   current LQ problem. The proposed procedure requires the selection of
   acceptable production and pollution risks by the user before a LQ value
   can be obtained. Existing definitions implicitly emphasise the field and
   farm level. However, LQ is also important at the regional and higher
   level which, so far, has received little attention. Then, again, an
   agro-ecological approach is suggested when defining the LQ as input into
   the planning process, emphasising not only an independent assessment of
   the potential for agricultural production, but also of nature
   conservation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In countries around the Mediterranean basin, the degradation of soil and
   water resources is a serious threat for the human welfare and the
   natural environment as a result of the unique climate, topography, soil
   characteristics, and peculiarities of agriculture. The detrimental
   effects of agricultural practices on soil quality include, erosion,
   desertification, salinization, compaction, and pollution. The resultant
   impacts on water resources include pollution due to nutrient and
   pesticide leaching and intrusion of seawater into aquifers. In order to
   select the appropriate sustainable strategies for preventing those
   impacts, research should focus on development of an accurate soil
   quality monitoring system at multiple scales based on a functional
   evaluation of soils. The objectives of this work are: (a) to point out
   the peculiarities of the Mediterranean region; (b) to underline the most
   important impacts of agricultural practices on soil and water quality,
   in respect to the above peculiarities; and (c) to propose a simple and
   cost effective methodology for the assessment of soil quality at a
   watershed scale, based on zones of specific functional interest. The
   proposed assessment methodology would provide information about the
   status of the soil resources, correlate soil quality with management and
   aid with the development of sustainable management practices. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The maintenance of soil quality is critical to environmental
   sustainability. Although, several papers have been published on this
   subject, progress in soil quality monitoring has been slow: Knowledge
   and assessment of changes (positive or negative) in its status with time
   is needed to evaluate the impact of different management practices.
   Selection of key indicators and their critical limits (threshold
   values), which must be maintained for normal functioning of the soil,
   are required to monitor changes and determine trends in improvement or
   deterioration in soil quality for various agro-ecological zones for use
   at district, national and global levels. Many soil indicators interact
   with each other, and thus, the value of one is affected by one or more
   of the selected parameters. Interdependence of pH and nutrient
   availability, electrical conductivity and infiltration, etc. has been
   well documented by many researchers. Some researchers have proposed
   procedures for evaluating soil quality functions by combining and
   integrating specific elements into soil quality indices. These
   procedures allow for weighting of various functions, depending upon the
   user goals and socio-economic concerns.
   Although, selection of soil indicators will vary with societal goals,
   the followings seem to be suitable indicators for crop production in
   most cases: organic matter, topsoil-depth, infiltration, aggregation,
   pH, electrical conductivity, suspected pollutants and soil respiration.
   Crop yield can be used as an integrator of the foregoing soil
   indicators. A minimum set of data on soil indicators must be identified
   to develop meaningful soil quality assessment. Also, monitoring soil
   indicators needs to set up sampling strategies allowing assessment of
   changes in soil quality which might be hidden by soil heterogeneity, by
   seasonal fluctuations or by analytical uncertainties. This paper
   describes the guidelines that can be followed to identify critical
   limits for the key indicators and the procedure for monitoring changes
   in soil quality trend. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An understanding of the nature of soils in natural and human influence
   ecosystems is essential if progress is to be made in the determination
   and monitoring of soil quality. This paper briefly discuss the changing
   circumstances which have resulted in the increased awareness of the
   importance of soil as a key component of both natural and human
   influenced environmental systems. These changed circumstances and the
   recognition of the often crucial role that soils play within these
   systems has resulted in a demand for measures of soil quality, similar
   to those used in the characterisation of water and air. Whilst it is
   relatively straightforward to quantify the fitness to breathe of air, or
   the fitness to drink with respect to water, it is considerably more
   difficult to identify similar criteria to be applied to soil. In part
   this arises because of the wide range of uses to which soils are put and
   in part because of the complexity of the soil system and the possibility
   that changes in the soil may be slow and possibly only occur when some
   threshold is reached. The paper stresses that any index of soil quality
   must consider soil function, and these functions are varied and often
   complex. A soil which is considered to be of high quality for one
   function may not be so for other functions. As a consequence there are
   potentially many soil properties which might serve its indicators of
   soil quality, and research is required to identify the most suitable. It
   may also be questioned whether it is appropriate to pursue this notion
   of a limited number of soil quality indicators. If an indicator is
   chosen comparisons between sites and results from different
   investigators are not possible unless the methods of analysis are given.
   Standard methods of soil analysis must be developed. These standard
   methods are distinct from national standard values, or indicator values
   frequently set by national governments or regulatory agencies. The
   International Standardisation Organisation (ISO) has developed a
   programme for the development of standard methods of soil analysis
   across a range of possible properties including visible, biological,
   physical and chemical properties. If it is decided that soil quality
   indicators are required and progress is to be made on developing
   acceptable indicators of soil quality with agreed standard methods of
   determination there is need for co-operation amongst soil scientists and
   those involved in determining appropriate and sustainable use of the
   soil. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality represents an integral value of the compositional
   structures and natural functions of soil in relation to soil use and
   environmental conditions on site. Among the indigenous soil components,
   different organisms and especially microorganisms play a key role in
   ecologically important biogeochemical processes. In that way, soil
   microorganisms contribute to the maintenance of the matter and energy
   transfer in terrestrial environments. Under stress conditions caused by
   adverse anthropogenic effects such as dissemination of chemical
   pollutants, the development and biochemical activities of soil
   microorganisms undergo several alterations. To prevent negative
   ecological consequences, microbiologically-related parameters should be
   involved in the indication of soil quality. In order to indicate some
   reliable indicators, an international project was established in which
   scientists from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Russia, Slovak Republic and
   Germany were participating. Standardized methods for selected
   microbiological and biochemical soil parameters were repeatedly applied
   in the individual laboratories on soil samples from rather unaffected
   and anthropogenically-affected soil sites (49 in total). After
   evaluation of more than 20 individual parameters it was concluded that
   N-2-fixing bacteria, total microbial biomass, soil respiration,
   dehydrogenase activity, and perhaps also the humification activity of
   soil microorganisms could serve as sensitive indicators of soil quality.
   Further research is necessary, however, to recognize critical limits
   with respect to the different soil types and uses. Seasonal oscillations
   in ecologically-related soil biological activities which regularly occur
   should be appropriately respected. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Field experiments were conducted to examine the effects of organic and
   synthetic soil fertility amendments on soil microbial communities and
   soil physical and chemical properties at three organic and three
   conventional vegetable farms in Virginia and Maryland in 1996 and 1997.
   Two treatments, including either an alternative organic soil amendment
   (composted cotton-gin trash, composted yard waste, or cattle manure) or
   synthetic soil amendment (fertilizer) were applied to three replicated
   plots at each grower field location. Production history and time
   affected propagule densities of Trichoderma species which remained
   higher in soils from organic farms. Propagule densities of Trichoderma
   species, thermophilic microorganisms, and enteric bacteria were also
   detected in greater numbers in soils amended with alternative than
   synthetic amendments, whereas propagule densities of Phytophthora and
   Pythium species were lower in soils amended with alternative than
   synthetic fertility amendments. Concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, and Mn were
   higher in soils amended with alternative than synthetic fertility
   amendments. Canonical correlations and principle component analyses
   indicated significant correlation between these soil chemical factors
   and the biological communities. First-order canonical correlations were
   more negative in fields with a conventional history, and use of
   synthetic fertilizers, whereas canonical correlations were more positive
   in fields with a history of organic production and alternative soil
   amendments. In the first year, yields of corn or melon were not
   different in soil amended with either synthetic or organic amendments at
   four of six farms. In the second year, when all growers planted
   tomatoes, yields were higher on farms with a history of organic
   production, regardless of soil amendment type. Alternative fertility
   amendments, enhanced beneficial soil microorganisms reduced pathogen
   populations, increased soil organic matter, total carbon, and cation
   exchange capacity (CEC), and lowered bulk density thus improving soil
   quality. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Twelve grassland sites were sampled inside and outside the Mountain
   Zebra National Park (MZNP), South Africa to assess changes in
   grasshopper assemblages to grazing by indigenous mammals inside the park
   compared to grazing by domestic cattle outside. The MZNP has been
   restored from cattle-grazed farmland to indigenous mammal parkland for
   62 years. The number of grasshopper species and families inside the park
   was not significantly different from outside the park, but the number of
   individuals inside the park was significantly higher. Multivariate
   statistics did not reveal any strong site groupings based on simple
   inside/outside comparisons, but there were clear groupings of sites
   based on vegetation characteristics and other environmental variables.
   The park boundary, therefore, does not significantly determine
   grasshopper assemblages, although intensity of grazing does. The
   indigenous mammals inside the park had the same effect on grasshoppers
   as the domestic cattle outside, and it was the level of defoliation and
   trampling that was important rather than the type of mammal. Intensive
   livestock grazing and trampling leads to bush encroachment and reduction
   in grass cover and/or disappearance of several grass species. In
   response to this pressure, grasshopper populations dropped, with
   localized extirpation of some species. Vegetation composition and
   structure, particularly grass height and percentage cover, had a
   significant effect on grasshopper assemblages. The MZNP is thus an area
   of localized, elevated grasshopper abundance in comparison with the
   surrounding farms, and presumably represents a situation prior to the
   current, intensive farming activities. Such elevated grasshopper
   abundances are important for maintaining soil quality and hence
   ecological integrity of this landscape which is poor in organics and
   nitrogen. The MZNP could be viewed as a centre where species with high
   mobility may seek refuge from anthropogenic pressures. The MZNP also
   serves as a reference illustrating the differences between
   restored-through-natural-succession and anthropogenically disturbed
   habitats, and compares desirable with undesirable ecosystem changes for
   herbivorous invertebrates such as grasshoppers.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to provide a better understanding of the
   relationship between foliar nutrient status, maple dieback and soil
   quality. Fieldwork was conducted in four maple stands, two of which were
   located in the Appalachians at Tingwick and two in the Laurentians at
   Duchesnay. All stands were characterised by a mound and depression
   microrelief. In one of the Tingwick maple stands (T-1) the predominant
   soil type was found on mounds, and was well to moderately well-drained
   (Leeds and Woodbridge series). At the other site (T-2), the predominant
   soil type was in depressions, and imperfectly to poorly drained
   (Sainte-Marie and Brompton series). At the first Duchesnay site (D-1)
   the predominant soil type was found on mounds and was well to rapidly
   drained (Ste Agathe series). At the second Duchesnay site (D-2), the
   predominant soil type was also found on mounds, but was well to
   moderately well-drained (Sergent series). On all sites, the soils were
   acidic and nutrient poor. The lowest pH values and nutrient
   concentrations (in the H-Ah horizons) were found in maple stands with
   well-drained soils (T-1 and D-1) (P < 0.05). On these sites, maple
   dieback was less than 10\%. It was on the poorly to imperfectly drained
   soils at Tingwick (T-2), as well as on the moderately drained soils at
   Duchesnay (D-2), that we observed the lowest biological activity.
   Although these soils were the most nutrient rich, we observed foliar
   nutrient deficiencies, and maple dieback in excess of 25\%. Our results
   suggest that maple dieback is the result of a poor physiological
   adaptation of sugar maple to poor drainage conditions in the areas
   studied.}},

Abstract = {{We used soil analyses, a greenhouse experiment, and a field experiment
   to examine the roles of competition and abiotic soil factors in plant
   community pattern formation in a California grassland. We collected
   soils from five microhabitats: one dominated by the native perennial
   grass Sporobolus airoides Torrey (alkali sacaton), two dominated by the
   nonnative annual grass species Hordeum marinum (Hudson) ssp. gussoneanum
   (Parl.) Thell (foxtail) and Bromus diandrus Roth (ripgut grass), and
   bare soil created either by gopher mounds or by high salt concentrations
   (sodic soils). We used principal Components analysis (PCA) to determine
   whether soils from these five microhabitats differed ill any discernible
   pattern. In the greenhouse we examined the emergence, growth, and
   survival of the native perennial in soil from the five habitat types. In
   the field we then examined a combined survival and reproduction measure
   to assess how competition with the two nonnative annual grasses affected
   the fitness of S. airoides. PCA revealed that B. diandrus soils were
   distinct from soils occupied by S. airoides, although the perennial
   emerged, grew, and survived well on these soils in the greenhouse.
   Despite some differences in soil quality in the greenhouse experiment,
   sacaton emergence, growth, and survival were possible in all five soils.
   Those S. airoides plants that survived in sodic soils grew far larger
   than plants grown in other soils survival, however, was very low in
   sodic soils. Sacaton actually performed worst in soils from areas
   dominated by S. airoides. In the field experiment, total available soil
   nitrogen affected reproduction and survival. In addition, soil ammonium
   levels interacted with competition from B. diandrus to produce lower
   survival than in control plots. There was no survival in the presence of
   high densities of H. marinum gussoneanum. The two nonnative species seem
   to represent threats from two distinct types of invaders: (1)
   ``selective invaders,{''} which only invade a narrow range of habitats
   but can restrict natives from those habitat types, and (2) ``twin
   invaders,{''} which have similar niches to the native and can exist over
   almost the same range of habitats as the native. Twin invaders can
   potentially reduce fitness or threaten the persistence of the native
   over much of its range.}},
