Abstract = {{Permanent grasslands represented a common type of land use in northern
   Italy traditional agriculture, but its area has been constantly
   declining over the last 50 years. Three permanent grasslands of the Po
   valley (northern Italy) were characterized in terms of biodiversity and
   soil quality and were compared with other agricultural land uses. Two
   indicators of biological soil quality (BSQ-ar, BSQ-c) were also applied
   and validated. Results demonstrated the importance of permanent
   grasslands as biodiversity `hot spots' within the intensive
   agroecosystems. The quality of soils was higher in permanent grasslands
   with respect to the arable lands, as evidenced by the standard soil
   quality indicators (organic carbon, aggregate stability) and confirmed
   by BSQ. This research proposes BSQ as a synthetizing soil quality
   indicator. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

Abstract = {{This study is part of the long-term monitoring of Finnish arable land
   and it is based on soil analyses of 705 monitoring sites sampled in
   1998. The same sites were sampled twice previously, in 1974 and 1987. We
   describe here the state of the Finnish cultivated soils in 1998 and
   changes in soil quality since 1987. The samples were analysed for
   organic C, volume weight, pH, P, K, Ca, S, Mg, Al, B, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu,
   Fe, Mn, Mo, Se and Zn. Macronutrients were extracted with 0.5 M ammonium
   acetate + 0.5 M acetic acid (pH 4.65) and most micronutrients, Al and
   heavy metals with the same solution + 0.02 M Na(2)EDTA. Hot water was
   used to extract B and Se.
   From 1987 to 1998, soil P, Ca, Mg, S, Cr, Cu,. Zn, volume weight and
   electrical conductivity increased and soil K, B, pH and organic C
   decreased. There was no change in soil Al, Cd, Mn and Ni. Between 1987
   and 1998, the use of P, K, B and Cu in mineral fertilisers declined
   whereas that of Ca in liming agents and Zn in mineral fertilisers
   increased. With the exception of P and Cu, these changes affected the
   concentrations, of easily soluble macro- and micronutrients in the soil
   accordingly. The slight decrease in soil pH might be due to the increase
   in the use of fertliser N. The finding that soil Cd and Ni ceased to
   increase and that soil Cr increased only slightly was attributed to the
   dramatic reduction in. national emissions and bulk depositions of heavy
   metals.}},

Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SCIENCE IN FINLAND}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{311-328}},
Abstract = {{Worldwide interest in soil quality evaluation has increased rapidly
   throughout the past decade, prompting us to evaluate the long-term
   impact of four cropping systems on several biological, chemical and
   physical determinants of soil quality. We hypothesized that after 17
   years several of the determinants would show significant differences
   between conventional cereal and low input/organic rotations. Four crop
   rotations were imposed on a silt soil from 1982 through 1999. Rotation A
   was a conventionally managed cereal rotation that received 100\% of the
   recommended mineral fertilizer each year. Rotation B was also managed
   conventionally from 1982 until 1993, although it received only 50\% of
   the recommended mineral fertilizer. From 1994 through 1999, rotation B
   was managed as an organic rotation. Rotations C and D were low-input
   rotations with plant residues returned either untreated (C) or composted
   (D) from 1982 until 1994. From 1994 through 1999, they were also managed
   organically. Significant decreases in extractable phosphorus (P) and
   potassium were observed in rotations C and D compared with rotation A,
   presumably because their yearly nutrient inputs were somewhat lower. The
   amount of soil organic carbon (C(org)), soil water holding capacity, the
   numbers and biomass of earthworms and the microbial biomass carbon and
   nitrogen were or tended to be higher in low input/organic than in
   conventionally managed plots. These effects may be in connection with
   the slightly increased levels of C(org) in soil of the organic
   rotations. Activities of twelve enzymes were strongly affected by
   sampling time (early- versus late-summer), but much less by long-term
   management. Litter decomposition, numbers of soil nematodes, arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity, AM spore density and AM functioning
   were little affected by rotation. However, AM spore density correlated
   positively with the high amounts of extractable calcium and P which were
   a result from excessive liming applied to some plots in 1982. The
   crucial question to be answered in future is whether plant growth and
   yield will correlate with the changes in soil properties. This question
   will be dealt with in a further paper using data from the same
   experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Arable soil is a functional unit whose condition is vital to crop
   production, but also to ecosystems at large owing to the significant
   role of soil in global nutrient cycles and balances. The soil quality
   concept recognises the concern for the sustainability of current arable
   land use practices. It integrates soil chemical, physical and biological
   properties, and takes account of the interaction of soil with water and
   air. This paper reviews the soil quality concept and its applications
   and discusses the importance of the concept for the assessment of
   Finnish arable soils. Many aspects of the chemical quality of arable
   soil are already well known in Finland. In contrast, follow-up of the
   physical and biological soil components, which are increasingly seen as
   important features of soil quality, is rudimentary. For monitoring of
   the soil quality at different scales - field, regional, national and
   global a suitable set of indicators needs to be identified. In this
   paper particular attention is paid to the potential importance and
   usefulness of selected biological indicators. It is clear that more
   basic research is needed to provide scientists and advisors with a solid
   basis for transmitting reliable information on soil quality. While the
   soil quality concept has been justifiably criticised, it has clear
   merits in the integrated handling of the soil entity and in highlighting
   the environmental aspects of arable soil quality.}},

Title = {{Short fallows of Tithonia diversifolia and Crotalaria grahamiana for
   soil fertility improvement in western Kenya}},
Journal = {{AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{55}},

Pages = {{181-194}},
Abstract = {{Managed short-duration fallows may have the potential to replace longer
   fallows in regions where population density no longer permits slow
   natural fallow successions. The purpose of fallows is not only to
   improve subsequent crop performance but also to restore soil fertility
   and organic matter content for the long term. We therefore evaluated the
   soil organic matter and nutrient flows and fractions in a short fallow
   experiment managed in the western Kenya highlands, and also compared the
   experimental area with a 9-12-yr-old adjacent natural bush fallow. The
   factorial agroforestry field experiment with four land-use and two P
   fertilizer treatments on a Kandiudalfic Eutrudox showed that 31-wk
   managed fallows with Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsley) A. Gray and
   Crotalaria grahamiana Wight \& Arn. improved soil fertility and organic
   matter content above those of a natural weed fallow and continuous maize
   (Zea mays L.). Post-fallow maize yields were also improved, although
   cumulative three-season increases in yield were small (0-1.2 Mg ha(-1))
   when the yield foregone during the fallow season was accounted for.
   Improvements in yield and soil quality could be traced to quantity or
   quality of biomass recycled by the managed fallows. The non-woody
   recycled biomass produced by the continuous maize, weed fallow, and
   tithonia treatments was near 2 Mg ha(-1), whereas crotalaria produced
   three times more recyclable biomass and associated N and P. Increases in
   topsoil N due to the fallows may have been attributable in part to deep
   acquisition and recycling of N by the fallows. Particulate macro-organic
   matter produced by the fallows contained sufficient N (30-50 kg ha(-1))
   to contribute substantially to maize production. Organic P accumulation
   (29 kg ha(-1)) similarly may play a significant role in crop nutrition
   upon subsequent mineralization. The effect of the P fertilizer
   application on soil properties and maize yield was constant for all
   land-use systems (i.e., no land- use system x P fertilizer interactions
   occurred). There was an indication that tithonia may have stimulated
   infestation of Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth., and care must be taken
   to evaluate the full effects of managed fallows over several seasons.}},

Abstract = {{Recent interest in soil quality and rangeland health, and the large
   areas set aside under the USDA Conservation Reserve Program, have
   contributed to a gradual convergence of assessment, monitoring, and
   management approaches in croplands and rangelands. The objective of this
   paper is to describe a basis for integrating soils and soil quality into
   rangeland monitoring, and through monitoring, into management. Previous
   attempts to integrate soil indicators into rangeland monitoring programs
   have often failed due to a lack of understanding of how to apply those
   indicators to ecosystem function and management. We discuss four
   guidelines that we have used to select and interpret soil and soil
   quality indicators in rangelands and illustrate them using a recently
   developed rangeland monitoring system. The guidelines include (i)
   identifying a suite of indicators that are consistently correlated with
   the functional status of one or more critical ecosystem processes,
   including those related to soil stability, soil water infiltration, and
   the capacity or the ecosystem to recover following disturbance; (ii)
   basing indicator selection on inherent soil and site characteristics and
   on site- or project-specific resource concerns, such as erosion or
   species invasion; (iii) using spatial variability in developing and
   interpreting indicators to make them more representative of ecological
   processes; and (iv) interpreting indicators in the context of an
   understanding of dynamic, nonlinear ecological processes defined by
   thresholds. The approach defined by these guidelines may serve as a
   paradigm for applying the soil quality concept in other ecosystems,
   including forests and ecosystems managed for annual and perennial crop
   production.}},

Abstract = {{The high-value, large-scale crop production systems in the San Joaquin
   Valley (SJV) of California typically entail intensive tillage and large
   fertilizer and water inputs but few C additions to the soil. Such
   practices often contribute to a decline in soil quality. Our objective
   for this participatory study was to examine the effects of supplemental
   C management practices (SCMPs) on various soil quality indicators. To
   increase farmer participation, we conducted the study on farms using a
   variety of SCMPs, including cover crops, compost and manure amendments,
   and several different crop rotations common to the region. The SCMPs
   significantly changed a number of soil properties, including soil
   organic matter (SOM); total Kjeldahl N; microbial biomass C and N;
   exchangeable K; Olsen P; and extractable Fe, Mn, and Zn. A comparison
   including previously established, adjacent organic, conventional, and
   transitional fields in addition to the treatment fields at one farm
   revealed significant differences in 16 of 18 soil quality indicators. A
   soil quality index computed for this farm scored the established organic
   system significantly higher than the conventional system. Our results
   suggest that significant changes in several soil quality indicators
   occur with a variety of SCMPs. This is especially noteworthy considering
   the intensive tillage, irrigation, and hot, semiarid environment of the
   SJV, California, where increases in SOM and related soil properties are
   generally not expected in a 3-yr study.}},

Abstract = {{The term soil quality (SQ) encompasses both a soil's productive and
   environmental capabilities. Strategies or frameworks that help farmers
   manage SQ are vital as sole emphasis on production can have negative
   environmental consequences and exclusive focus on environmental
   considerations could endanger supplies of food or fiber. Recent efforts
   in the USA have prioritized the development of SQ assessment strategies
   that would be used by individual farmers. The Illinois Soil Quality
   Initiative (ISQI) is an example of a participatory research strategy
   coupled with a SQ index-screening trial conducted on farm fields. A
   multivariate approach was used to identify promising indices and
   document tradeoffs in soil condition that were associated with tillage
   choices. Participatory aspects of the project confirmed that farmers
   appreciated the multivariate nature of soil and had great interest in SQ
   and stewardship. A dialogue component of the project had been structured
   to identify and then respond to cooperators' SQ information needs and to
   contribute to the development of indices that were related to soil
   function. Cooperator feedback suggested that a simple extension of this
   approach would be incapable of motivating or justifying the adoption of
   SQ building practices because factors constraining management choices
   were primarily structural (socioeconomic). Constructive follow-up
   efforts might strive to develop techniques to integrate SQ information
   into frameworks that reflect the outcomes to be achieved within social
   or economic contexts. Only by devising such strategies (which might
   combine models, indices, expert knowledge, and/or direct measurement)
   will we be able to manage the soil resource to achieve desired ends.}},

Abstract = {{The mission of the Soil Quality Institute (SQI) of the USDA Natural
   Resources Conservation Service is to develop and disseminate tools for
   soil quality assessment. In keeping with this mission, the SQI, through
   partnerships, has developed two assessment tools for use by farmers and
   field staff. We review these efforts here. The first, the Soil Quality
   Card Design Guide, provides a nine-step process for conducting workshops
   to guide farmers in the development of locally adapted soil quality
   assessment cards. The second, the Soil Quality Test Kit Guide, provides
   instructions and interpretations for 11 field tests representing
   physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil. In this paper, we
   present a summary of soil quality cards developed in seven states. An
   important strength of the soil quality card design process lies with the
   active participation of farmers to design the cards themselves as part
   of locally lead conservation activities. We also present results from
   soil quality test kit training workshops showing that the test kit
   provides an excellent framework for teaching soil quality concepts in
   the field. Regular use to compare effects of management systems or
   monitor changes over time will likely be limited to farmers with fairly
   high skill levels, specialists, and agricultural consultants.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality concepts are commonly used to evaluate sustainable land
   management in agroecosystems. The objectives of this review were to
   trace the importance of soil organic matter (SOM) in Canadian
   sustainable land management studies and illustrate the role of SOM and
   aggregation in sustaining soil functions. Canadian studies on soil
   quality were initiated in the early 1980s and showed that loss of SOM
   and soil aggregate stability were standard features of nonsustainable
   land use. Subsequent studies have evaluated SOM quality using the
   following logical sequence: soil purpose and function, processes,
   properties and indicators, and methodology. Limiting steps in this soil
   quality framework are the questions of critical limits and
   standardization for soil properties. At present, critical limits for SOM
   are selected using a commonly accepted reference value or based on
   empirically derived relations between SOM and a specific soil process or
   function (e.g., soil fertility, productivity, or erodibility). Organic
   matter fractions (e.g., macro-organic matter, light fraction, microbial
   biomass, and mineralizable C) describe the quality of SOM. These
   fractions have biological significance for several soil functions and
   processes and are sensitive indicators of changes in total SOM. Total
   SOM influences soil compactibility, friability, and soil water-holding
   capacity while aggregated SOM has major implications for the functioning
   of soil in regulating air and water infiltration, conserving nutrients,
   and influencing soil permeability and erodibility. Overall, organic
   matter inputs, the dynamics of the sand-sized macro-organic matter, and
   the soil aggregation process are important factors in maintaining and
   regulating organic matter functioning in soil.}},

Abstract = {{Perennial forages provide numerous ecosystem services - cleaner surface
   and ground water, improved soil quality, reduced airborne particulates,
   and richer wildlife habitat. Especially when these crops are planted on
   strategically selected soils and landscape positions, they can
   effectively protect and enhance the environment while providing
   economically viable returns. Deeply rooted, high yielding perennial
   forages also have proven useful in remediating contaminated sites. As
   more roles for these crops develop, forage producers should take credit

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are key components of soil microbiota and
   obviously interact with other microorganisms in the rhizosphere, i.e.
   the zone of influence of plant roots on microbial populations and other
   soil constituents. Mycorrhiza formation changes several aspects of plant
   physiology and some nutritional and physical properties of the
   rhizospheric soil. These effects modify the colonization patterns of the
   root or mycorrhizas (mycorrhizosphere) by soil microorganisms. The
   rhizosphere of mycorrhizal plants, in practice a mycorrhizosphere,
   harbors a great array of microbial activities responsible for several
   key ecosystem processes. This paper summarizes the main conceptual
   principles and accepted statements on the microbial interactions between
   mycorrhizal fungi and other members of rhizosphere microbiota and
   discusses current developments and future trends concerning the
   following topics: (i) effect of soil microorganisms on mycorrhiza
   formation; (ii) mycorrhizosphere establishment; (iii) interactions
   involved in nutrient cycling and plant growth; (iv) interactions
   involved in the biological control of plant pathogens; and (v)
   interactions to improve soil quality. The main conclusion is that
   microbial interactions in the rhizosphere of mycorrhizal plants improve
   plant fitness and soil quality, critical issues for a sustainable
   agricultural development and ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was established in 1993 on a sodic Vertosol (Vertisol,
   Typic Haplustert) at Merah North, north-western New South Wales, to
   evaluate the sustainability of selected irrigated cotton (Gossypium
   hirsutum L.)-rotation crop sequences. Crop sequences were selected
   following discussions with local cotton growers. The indices used to
   evaluate sustainability included soil quality, microbiology, yield and
   profitability. This paper presents data on soil properties {[}soil
   organic C, structure as air-filled porosity of oven-dried soil,
   exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and Na, pH, electrical conductivity (EC1:5) and
   EC1:5/exchangeable Na in the 0-0.6 m depth], lint yield and
   profitability (as gross margins/ha and gross margins/ML of irrigation
   water). The 6 cropping systems sown after minimum tillage were:
   continuous cotton (R1), long-fallow cotton (R2), cotton-green manured
   faba bean (Vicia faba L.) (R3), cotton-dolichos (Lablab purpureus
   L.)-green manured faba bean in the first year followed by cotton-wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) (R4), cotton-dolichos (R5), cotton-fertilised
   dolichos (with P and K removed by cotton replaced as fertiliser) (R6).
   In 1996, air-filled porosity of oven-dried soil was highest with R4 at
   the surface but lowest with R1 in the 0.15-0.30 m depth. In subsequent
   years, air-filled porosity of oven-dried soil was higher with R2 and R4
   in the deeper depths, although differences between cropping sequences
   were small. Air-filled porosity of oven-dried soil increased between
   1996 and 1998 in all treatments, and was probably caused by the change
   from intensive to minimum tillage in 1993, irrigation with moderately
   saline water and application of gypsum resulting in an increase in
   EC1:5/exchangeable Na. In general, differences in soil properties such
   as soil organic C, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and Na, pH, electrical
   conductivity (EC1:5) and EC1:5/exchangeable Na between cropping
   sequences were far less than those which occurred with time. The key
   changes were decreases in pH, exchangeable sodium percentage,
   exchangeable cations and organic C between 1994 and 1996, and increases
   in air-filled porosity of oven-dried soil, EC1:5 and EC1:5/exchangeable
   Na between 1996 and 1998. A decrease in air-filled porosity of
   oven-dried soil occurred between 1998 and 1999 as a consequence of
   preparing land and sowing cotton under very wet conditions. R1 had the
   highest cumulative gross margin/ha and R3 had the lowest. R2 had the
   highest cumulative gross margin/ML of irrigation water and R3 again the
   lowest. Among crop sequences, R2 and R4 gave the best returns with
   respect to both land and water resources.}},

Abstract = {{In many industrialized countries the use of land is impeded by soil
   pollution from a variety of sources. Decisions on clean-up, management
   or set-aside of contaminated land are based on various considerations,
   including human health risks, but ecological arguments do not have a
   strong position in such assessments. This paper analyses why this should
   be so, and what ecotoxicology and theoretical ecology can improve on the
   situation. It seems that soil assessment suffers from a fundamental
   weakness, which relates to the absence of a commonly accepted framework
   that may act as a reference. Soil contamination can be assessed both
   from a functional perspective and a structural perspective. The
   relationship between structure and function in ecosystems is a
   fundamental question of ecology which receives a lot of attention in
   recent literature, however, a general concept that may guide
   ecotoxicological assessments has not yet arisen. On the experimental
   side, a good deal of progress has been made in the development and
   standardized use of terrestrial model ecosystems (TME). In such systems,
   usually consisting of intact soil columns incubated in the laboratory
   under conditions allowing plant growth and drainage of water, a
   compromise is sought between field relevance and experimental
   manageability. A great variety of measurements can be made on such
   systems, including microbiological processes and activities, but also
   activities of the decomposer soil fauna. I propose that these TMEs can
   be useful instruments in ecological soil quality assessments. In
   addition a ``bioinformatics approach'' to the analysis of data obtained
   in TME experiments is proposed. Soil function should be considered as a
   multidimensional concept and the various measurements can be considered
   as indicators, whose combined values define the ``normal operating
   range'' of the system. Deviations from the normal operating range
   indicate that the system is in a condition of stress. It is hoped that
   more work along this line will improve the prospects for ecological
   arguments in soil quality assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Differences between organic and conventional management were
   investigated for 14 paired topsoil sites (28 fields) from around the
   south and east of England, the majority being in arable management.
   Parameters used were soil organic matter content, total nitrogen content
   and available phosphorus, potassium and magnesium, pH, topsoil depth and
   shear strength. The aim was to assess differences in management and to
   draw inferences for sustainable soil management practices. Organically
   managed topsoils were found to be characterized by deeper plough
   horizons and higher percentage organic matter, total nitrogen and
   available P. They had lower shear strengths and were substantially lower
   in available K than their conventional counterparts. No significant
   differences in available Mg or pH were found between management classes.
   It is concluded that soil organic matter content, total N, available P
   and K, topsoil depth and shear strength were effective `sustainability
   indicators'.}},

Abstract = {{The soil quality was evaluated following the addition of organic matter
   and microorganisms to a clay loam soil collected in Aranjuez (Madrid)
   under controlled conditions of temperature and moisture, and over a
   period of three months. The following treatments were carried out: soil
   (control); soil + 50 t/ha of animal manure (E50); soil + 50 t/ha of
   animal manure + 301/ha of effective microorganisms (E50EM); soil + 30
   t/ha of combination of various green crop residues and weeds (RC30) and
   soil + 30 t/ha of combination of various green crop residues and weeds +
   301/ha of effective microorganisms (RC30EM). The soil samples were taken
   before and after the incubation and analysed using physical, chemical
   and microbiological parameters. A significant increase in the production
   of polysaccharides and alkaline phosphatase and esterase enzymes in the
   treatments E50EM and RC30EM was observed, being in direct correlation
   with the humification of the organic matter, with the water retention at
   field capacity, and with the cationic exchange capacity (CEC). It can be
   concluded that the incorporation of microorganisms EM potentialized the
   soil biological activity and improved physicochemical soil properties,
   contributing to a quick humification of fresh organic matter. Those
   findings were proved by microbiological activities of exopolysaccharides
   by alcaline phosphatase and esterase enzymes, which can be used as
   earlier and integral soil health indicators.}},

Title = {{Tillage intensity effects on chemical indicators of soil quality in two
   coastal plain soils}},
Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{913-932}},
Abstract = {{Few experiments in the coastal plain region of the southeastern United
   States have reported the effect of long-term tillage and tillage
   intensity on chemical soil quality indicators. The purpose of this study
   was to determine the 17-year influence of four tillage systems on
   chemical soil quality indicators in a Benndale fine sandy loam
   (coarse-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic, Typic Paleudults) and a
   Lucedale very fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, subactive,
   thermic, Rhodic Paleudults) in the coastal plain region of Alabama.
   Tillage systems were no-tillage, disk, moldboard plow, and chisel plow
   under varied double-cropping in a randomized complete block design with
   four replications. Soil pH, sum of extractable bases, soil organic
   carbon (SOC), and soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca),
   magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu),
   and iron (Fe) were determined on soil samples collected at depths of
   0-2.5, 2.5-7.5, 7.5-15.0, 15.0-22.5, and 22.5-30 cm. Soil carbon (C)
   accumulation occurred primarily in the top 2.5 cm, varied by soil type,
   and was inversely proportional to tillage intensity. The coarse textured
   Benndale soil averaged 27.6, 13.1, 12.7, and 10.4 g C kg(-1) soil with
   no-tillage, disk, chisel, and moldboard plow management, respectively,
   in the top 2.5 cm. The finer textured Lucedale soil averaged 16.7, 10.0,
   9.8, and 6.9 g C kg(-1) soil, for the same treatments and depth,
   respectively. Surface applications of lime maintained soil pH at an
   acceptable level within the plow layer on both soil types and all
   tillage systems. Extractable P was higher with no-tillage than moldboard
   plowing to the 22.5 cm depth on the Lucedale soil. On the Benndale soil,
   P tended to accumulate at the 15 to 22.5 cm depth with tillage systems
   other than moldboard plowing, and no-tillage had the most extractable P
   at these depths. Soil C and pH combined proved effective as continuous
   pedotransfer functions, predicting 73\% and 86\% of the variation in sum
   of extractable bases for the Benndale and Lucedale soils, respectively.
   As determined from chemical indicators of soil quality, adoption of
   conservation tillage with doublecropping is a sustainable practice for
   these soils.}},

Abstract = {{Soil is a key natural resource and soil quality is one of the most
   important properties, which determines crop productivity and
   sustainability. Good soil quality not only produces good crop yield, but
   also maintains environmental quality and consequently plant, animal, and
   human health. The physical, chemical, biological, and ecological factors
   of a soil form its quality and determine crop productivity. These soil
   quality factors or properties can be modified or improved in favor of
   better soil quality through adoption of appropriate management
   practices. However, there are some permanent soil properties inherent to
   the soil like soil depth, slope, climate, texture, stoniness, and
   mineralogy contribute significantly to soil quality and are little
   affected by management. Selected soil management practices to improve
   soil quality are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Pasture management can be effective at sequestering soil organic C. We
   determined the depth distribution of particulate organic C (POC),
   non-particulate organic C (NPOC), particulate-to-total organic C
   (POC-to-TOC) ratio, and particulate organic C-to-N (POC-to-N) ratio
   under pastures near Watkinsville, GA, USA. POC was highly related with
   total organic C (TOC), but became an increasingly larger portion of TOC
   near the soil surface, where both pools were greatest. POC and NPOC were
   (i) greater under pasture than under conservation-tillage cropland, (ii)
   greater when pasture was grazed than when hayed, (iii) marginally
   greater with higher fertilization of pasture, (iv) greater with higher
   frequency of endophyte infection of tall fescue, and (v) greater under
   increasing stand age of grass. Soil under pasture comparisons that had
   greater TOC content had (i) larger improvements in POC than in NPOC and
   (ii) lower POC-to-N ratios, suggesting improvement in biochemical soil
   quality, as well as soil C sequestration. Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Berni-isolated (0.5 ha) plots have been used since 1995 to quantify
   changes in soil and water quality with conversion from agricultural to
   bioenergy crops. Soil quality improvements, including increases in soil
   carbon storage, have occurred on sites planted to woody or herbaceous
   species, and no-till corn compared with tilled corn or cotton. Initial
   increases in soil carbon occurred within the upper 10 cm of the soil
   profile. Soil carbon on plantings of switchgrass, no-till corn, and
   sweetgum with a cover crop between the rows increased over the first 3
   years. Soil carbon decreased by 6\% on the sweetgum plantings without a
   cover crop and remained lower through the fifth growing season. Overall,
   the greatest increases in belowground carbon storage have occurred
   primarily within the upper 40 cm. Former land use, growth
   characteristics, management practices, and soil characteristics appear
   to be the primary factors determining the timing, depth, and extent of
   changes in soil carbon storage for bioenergy and no-till crops.

Abstract = {{During the last decade, advances in our understanding of biodegradation
   principles, and lessons learned from bioremediation applications, have
   increased our knowledge base to help transition laboratory-based
   processes to the field. Within the group of organic anthropogenic
   compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), chlorinated volatile
   organic compounds (VOC), and the alkylbenzene (benzene, toluene, ethyl
   benzene, and the xylenes, BTEX) hydrocarbons are among the most
   frequently encountered pollutants in soils, groundwater aquifers and
   sediments. This chapter aims to describe the challenges posed by, and
   methodologies used during, the transfer of biodegradation principles to
   field application by addressing the following specific objectives: (i)
   principles of technology transfer and application to a chlorinated
   solvent-contaminated site, (ii) principles and applications of PAH, VOC,
   and BTEX bioremediation, and (iii) principles and applications of soil
   health assessment. Whereas the fundamental processes of biodegradation
   have been well established, harnessing these processes for in situ
   application is fraught with substantial uncertainty. These uncertainties
   are mainly due to site specificities associated with expression of the
   desired biodegradation activity, the difficulty with establishing causal
   relationships between biological activity and geochemical (organic and
   inorganic) changes, and the lack of data for a convincing cost-benefit
   analysis associated with bioremediation applications (i.e. does the
   investment of time and money substantially increase the overall health
   of the impacted environmental compartment?). In addition to the
   requirement for substantial technical expertise, these uncertainties are
   major impediments for site managers, problem owners, and technology
   adopters and implementers to make effective use of bioremediation
   technologies. The results indicate the need of more research on the use
   of in situ biomonitoring techniques at various temporal and spatial
   scales of environmental impact, and in optimization strategies for
   technology implementation within a quantitative uncertainty-based
   decision framework.}},

Abstract = {{Pistacia atlantica trees have a very limited distribution in wadis in
   the central Negev highlands, and erosive processes may have a negative
   impact on the recruitment and survival of the trees. We measured the
   sizes of the trunks of adult trees, the condition of their canopies,
   fruit density, insect herbivory, and soil parameters-both in eroded and
   noneroded habitats. This was to determine the habitat soil quality and
   how it relates to the demographic disposition and vitality of these
   trees. The results revealed irregular size/age distribution and possible
   poor recruitment. There were no differences in fruit density between
   trees in eroded and noneroded habitats. However, analysis on gall
   density per branch revealed that Slavum wertheimae prefer host plants in
   relatively uneroded habitats. Analysis of water-holding capacity, soil
   organic carbon content, and pH revealed significant differences, with
   better soil quality existing in noneroded areas.}},

Abstract = {{In the last part of the twentieth century, recognition became widespread
   of the important effect of agricultural runoff on the health of aquatic
   ecosystems in the Lake Erie basin and elsewhere. Because of the efforts
   to remediate Lake Erie, the ``dead lake{''} among the: Laurentian Great
   Lakes, a number of research and demonstration projects were undertaken
   in the Lake Erie basin to evaluate and foster adoption of conservation
   tillage and other farming techniques that would reduce runoff while
   maintaining productivity. In addition, intensive water quality studies
   of long duration were begun on major tributaries to Lake Eric during
   this time. The Lake Erie Agricultural Systems for Environmental Quality
   (LEASEQ) project examined governmental programs, changes in agriculture,
   and changes in, water and soil quality during the period 1975-1995, and
   sought to evaluate the linkages among these factors. The study area is
   characterized by extensive agricultural land use of soils developed from
   glacial materials deposited on Paleozoic, sedimentary bedrock, mostly
   limestone. Tile drainage is extensive, particularly in slow-draining
   clay-rich lacustrine soils in the lower reaches of the watersheds. This
   paper introduces the study area, its geology, geography, soils, and
   agricultural history in addition, we provide an overview of the LEASEQ
   concept and introduce the 11 other papers in this series, which provide
   a detailed exposition of the results of our studies.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Present agricultural land use and atmospheric deposition may lead to
   heavy-metal accumulation rates in soils that may violate soil quality
   standards in the future. To undertake suitable preventive measures
   against heavy-metal enrichment, flux balances in agroecosystems and
   their uncertainties have to be assessed. For this reason we developed an
   empirical stochastic model, PROTERRA-S, that considers heavy-metal
   inputs through agricultural management as well as outputs by crop
   removal and leaching on a regional scale. In this manuscript we describe
   application of PROTERRA-S to the Sundgau region in Switzerland.
   Considering uncertainty in informational and natural variability, large
   variations of the aggregated regional cadmium and zinc balances were
   found, with standard deviations that were of the same order of magnitude
   as their average values. Uncertainty in the simulated net zinc flux
   originated mainly from uncertainty in the zinc concentrations of manure
   and crops and from uncertainty in atmospheric deposition of zinc. For
   cadmium, the main contribution to the total uncertainty came from
   uncertainty in crop concentration, regression functions to estimate
   Freundlich parameters, atmospheric deposition, and from spatial
   variation of soil pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC). For both zinc
   and cadmium, informational uncertainty in input data were large,
   indicating that significant uncertainty reduction could be achieved by
   additional data collection campaigns. A monetary risk value for the
   regional zinc accumulation rate in Sundgau was calculated to be on the
   order of 22 million Euro.}},

Abstract = {{A two-year field study was conducted to evaluate the impact of
   Fertilization and arbuscular mycorrhizae on the in situ establishment of
   turfgrasses in low and high phosphorus content experimental sites.
   Organic or chemical fertilizers were applied on Kentucky Bluegrass and
   Creeping Bentgrass plots inoculated with either Glomus mosseae, G.
   aggregatum or G. intraradices. The arbuscular mycorrhizal control was
   made From original soils with their respective indigenous fungal
   populations. Soil surveys for indigenous Glomales populations revealed
   the predominance of Gigaspora margarita and Scutellospora calospora
   species at the high and low P sites, respectively. Both turfgrass
   species showed higher root colonization levels, up to 60\%, at the low
   phosphorus soil site. Root colonization levels of Creeping Bentgrass
   were found to be almost twice those of Kentucky Bluegrass for all
   mycorrhizal treatments. The average growth rates of aerial parts were
   not affected by either mycorrhizal or fertilization treatments.
   Statistical analyses showed a significant interaction (P less than or
   equal to 0.05) between high and low phosphorus sites for Creeping
   Bentgrass, and root colonization levels, especially with G. intraradices
   treatment. For both turfgrass species, fertilization and site effects
   were predominant. As turfgrass is highly dependent on soil quality and
   as arbuscular rnycorrhizal benefits vary with plant species, special
   care in the development of turfgrass management practices should be
   taken into account to optimize the arbuscular mycorrhizal turfgrass
   establishment process.}},

Abstract = {{To sustain productivity and environmental quality, an awareness of the
   impacts our management systems are having on soil quality is needed. The
   soil quality test kit is an on-farm tool that has been developed for
   conservationists and farmers to track changes in soil quality. The use
   of the kit was demonstrated by comparing soil quality on long-term
   no-till versus conventional tillage systems on a silt loam soil in
   Tennessee. The no-till management system had significantly improved
   surface soil properties over the conventionally tilled management system
   at this site. The no-till management system had higher infiltration
   rates, more stable aggregates, a lower soil respiration rate, a greater
   resistance to slaking, greater earthworm numbers, and a greater water
   content in the 0-7.6 cm soil depth. The soil quality test kit was able
   to distinguish differences in soil properties on this long-term
   management comparison. The kit is a good on-farm tool for use in
   comparison of relative differences in surface soil properties. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The West Asia-North Africa (WANA) region has a land area of 1.7 billion
   ha, and a population of 600 million. Desertification and soil
   degradation are severe problems in the region. The problem of drought
   stress is exacerbated by low and erratic rainfall and soils of limited
   available water holding capacity and a soil organic carbon (SOC) content
   of less than 0.5 per cent. The SOC pool of most soils has been depleted
   by soil degradation and widespread use of subsistence and exploitative
   farming systems. The historic loss of a SOC pool for the soils of the
   WANA region may be 6-12 Pg compared with the global loss of 66-90 Pg.
   Assuming that 60 per cent of the historic loss can be resequestered, the
   total soil-C sink capacity of the WANA region may be 3-7 Pg. This
   potential may be realized through adoption of measures to control
   desertification, restore degraded soils and ecosystems, and improve soil
   and crop management techniques that can enhance the SOC pool and improve
   soil quality. The strategies of soil C sequestration include integrated
   nutrient management (INM) and recycling, controlled grazing, and growing
   improved fodder species on rangeland. Improved technologies for cropland
   include use of INM and biofertilizers, appropriate tillage methods and
   residue management techniques, crop rotations and cover crops, and water
   and nutrient recycling technologies. Through adoption of such measures,
   the potential of soil-C sequestration in the WANA region is 0.2-0.4 Pg C

Pages = {{197-203}},
Abstract = {{Compaction and loss of mechanical stability and biological activity in
   agricultural soils cause reductions of infiltration capacity and
   increase the risk of severe flooding events. Triggering factors among
   agricultural production techniques for such a ``creeping sealing{''} are
   excessive mechanical loads through traffic and tillage operations,
   monotonous crop rotations, insufficient monitoring of structure forming
   parameters and processes and the use of pesticides.
   Maintaining a high infiltration capacity of soils is one of the most
   significant achievements of agriculture which is not covered by the
   prices of agricultural products. Independent of the production system
   conservation soil tillage improves significantly the infiltration
   capacity. But on conventional agricultural farms this technique has to
   be considered as one single factor in an otherwise hostile environment.
   On organic farms there are a number of factors with positive effects on
   infiltration rates. Organic farmed soils favour particularly the
   establishment of ``biopores{''} resulting in on an average twice as high
   infiltration rates than conventional farmed soils. The spatial extension
   of organic farming is therefore a measure of prime significance in the
   combat against the negative effects of the anthropogenic sealing of
   soils.
   Research needs are allocated for the modelling of infiltration,
   dependent on soil physical, chemical and biological parameters on
   different scales, the development of methods to determine mechanical
   stress on soils and related critical values, the improvement of methods
   for estimating the lime requirement of soils and the sustainable
   implementation of conservation soil tillage on organic farming systems.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated soil quality growth effects on Folsomia candida (Willem)
   (Collembola) in microcosm experiments. A high-quality forest soil
   (andosols) and pure sand were used as substrates in one experiment and
   soil quality was controlled by mixing the two soils using 25, 50, and
   100\% forest soil to sand (vol/vol basis). A higher forest soil to sand
   ratio increased microbial biomass N, total C (TC), and total N (TN)
   contents, soil respiration, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
   Collembolan body length increased with increasing proportions of forest
   soil. In another experiment using seven forest soils, collembolan growth
   was compared with soil parameters such as organic matter content, TC,
   TN, soil pH, microbial biomass (C, N, and P), and respiration. Growth
   was greater in soils with lower microbial biomass and higher microbial
   N/P ratio. Since higher microbial N/P indicated a higher percentage of
   bacteria] biomass, we concluded that collembolan growth reflected soil
   biological quality, especially bacterial activity.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing influences plant community structure, soil quality and
   health, and is likely to also affect the populations and diversity of
   soil biota. In our study, we determined the abundance and family level
   diversity of soil mites under very heavy and light grazing regimes, and
   a very heavy grazing exclosure, and asked whether there were differences
   in abundance of mite taxa that reflected the severity of disturbance.
   The field experiment we sampled was established in 1949 on a Rough
   Fescue Prairie with Orthic Black Chernozemic (Udic Haploboroll) soils
   near Stavely Alberta Canada. Soil cores were taken from the light
   (L)(1.2 AUM (animal unit month) ha 1) and very heavy (VH) (4.8 AUM
   ha(-1)) grazing regimes and the grazing recovery exclosure (Ex) in the
   very heavy grazing site in June and October 1999. The results showed
   that the soil temperature, moisture and bulk density varied between the
   grazing regimes, soil depth and the sampling times. Collembola were not
   abundant at any of the sites compared with Acari. Among Acari,
   prostigmatid mites were significantly more abundant in VH site and all
   the grazing treatments at both depths and sampling times. Oribatida, and
   to a lesser extent Mesostigmata, were more closely associated with
   reduced and undisturbed habitats than the Prostigmata, and there was a
   positive relationship between increased grassland productivity and the
   abundance and diversity of soil microarthropods. Our results suggest
   that Acari are sensitive to soil disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the sex ratio and spatial distribution of males
   and females in three populations of the endemic and restricted tropical
   dioecious shrub, Baccharis concinna (Asteraceae) in the mountainous
   region of Serra do Cipo, southeastern Brazil. The proportion of female
   plants in the population at lower elevation (1000 m a.s.l.) was
   significantly greater than of male plants. At this elevation of PIN and
   Ca/Al ratios in the soil were also greater indicating better nutritional
   status of the soils. The concentration of aluminium increased
   significantly with the elevation (p < 0.001), perhaps rendering soils
   less conducive to female plants at higher elevations. Female plants are
   possibly adversely affected to a greater extent by soil quality than
   male plants. The spatial distribution of the populations within habitat
   was tested by the K(t) function, where the neighbourhood of a given
   individual was defined by a circle with a radius (t) up to 3 m. Despite
   the strong tendency for aggregation, the distribution of the sexes
   within habitats was random and the hypothesis was not supported. The
   independent distribution of the sexes within habitats may be explained
   by nutrient homogeneity of the soils, as well as by an absence of
   antagonism between the sexes. Nevertheless, we found a trend for males
   and females to be aggregated according to their gender.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of the climatic aridity characterized by the weakness of the
   precipitation (annual average of 200 nun) and its irregularity
   throughout the seasons, the olive groves of the south insure 60\% of the
   Tunisian oil production. In those rainfall conditions, tree development
   and yield vary considerably and depend hugely on the soil quality. Olive
   crops evolvement during 60 years in three 80-year-old orchards shows
   that, the yield of the year (n) depend on rainfall of the same year and
   the year before (n-1). For olive trees planted on deep sandy soil, the
   yields reach 65 kg / year / tree and the alternate bearing is weak. But
   on clayey - loamy - sandy soil and often shallow (depth less than 0.8
   m), annual production didn't exceed 14 kg per tree and per year and the
   alternate bearing is frequent. Furthermore, our results show that the
   olive tree vegetative growth, flowering and fructification were in
   relation with the soil structure.}},

Abstract = {{In the Yaqui valley, northwest Mexico, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is
   grown as a winter crop followed by maize (Zea mays L.) as a summer crop
   both planted on beds. Straw of both crops is usually burned to
   facilitate seedbed preparation for the succeeding crop. Soil physical
   and biological attributes were determined from 1996 to 2000 from a study
   initiated in 1992 at the CIANO (Centro de Investigaciones Agr colas del
   Noroeste) experiment station. The objective was to compare five
   treatments: (1) conventional tilled bed (CTB)-straw incorporated, and
   permanent bed (PB) with (2) straw removed, (3) straw partly removed, (4)
   straw retained, and (5) straw burned - on soil strength, soil structure,
   and soil microbial biomass carbon (SMB). Seven N treatments were applied
   to wheat, but for the purpose of this study we chose a subset of three N
   treatments (0, 150 and 300 kg N ha(-1)) for measurements. Maize received
   a uniform application of 150 kg N ha(-1) each year. Soil strength
   decreased as the amount of crop residues applied for each tillage-straw
   treatment increased. Permanent beds-straw burned treatment had the
   highest soil strength and CTB-straw incorporated the lowest. The largest
   soil aggregate fractionation, evaluated with a fractal dimension
   parameter (D), corresponded to PB-straw burned treatment and the lowest
   to PB-straw retained treatment. SMB was greater at 0-7 cm than at 7-15
   cm depth. As the amount of crop residues increased in each tillage
   PB-straw treatment, the SMB generally increased. The largest amount of
   SMB occurred most often on either CTB-straw incorporated or PB-straw
   retained and the lowest in PB-straw burned treatment. The practice of
   retaining crop residues as stubble should be adopted in the Yaqui valley
   since changes resulting from burning crop residues showed the tendency
   to decrease productivity and soil quality as shown by increased soil
   strength and soil fractionation, and reduced SMB. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Effect of 19 years of different tillage (direct drilled vs. conventional
   tillage) and stubble management (stubble retained vs. burnt) on soil
   carbon fractions were studied in a red earth, an Oxic Paleustalf at
   Wagga Wagga, NSW. The changes in carbon fractions were related to
   observed changes in soil structural stability and nitro-en availability.
   Significant differences in total organic carbon (TOC) were detected to
   0.20 m depth, but the largest differences existed in the top 0.05 m
   where a difference of 8.0 g/kg (equivalent to 5.2 t ha(-1)) was found
   between the extreme treatments (direct drilled/stubble retained (DD/SR)
   vs. conventional cultivation/stubble burnt (CUSB)). Tillage had a much
   greater effect in reducing total carbon than stubble burning accounting
   for 80\% of the total difference between the extreme treatments in
   0-0.05 m layer. Tillage and stubble burning resulted in lower levels of
   different organic carbon fractions with tillage preferentially reducing
   the particulate organic carbon (POC) (> 53 mum) (both free and
   associated POCs), whereas stubble burning reduced the incorporated
   organic carbon (< 53 mum). We also found that tillage and stubble
   burning both significantly lowered the water stability of aggregate >2
   mm, whereas stubble burning was related to the reduction of water
   stability of aggregates < 50 mum. Furthermore, tillage was related to
   the decline in mineralisable nitrogen (MN) due to the loss of POC,
   especially the free POC fraction. POC was a more sensitive indicator of
   soil quality changes under different tillage and stubble management than
   TOC. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining and/or conserving organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)
   concentrations in the soil using management practices can improve its
   fertility and productivity and help to reduce global warming by
   sequestration of atmospheric CO2 and N-2. We examined the influence of 6
   years of tillage (no-till, NT; chisel plowing, CP; and moldboard
   plowing, MP), cover crop (hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) vs. winter
   weeds), and N fertilization (0, 90, and 180 kg N ha(-1)) on soil organic
   C and N concentrations in a Norfolk sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous,
   thermic, Typic Kandiudults) under tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)
   and silage corn (Zea mays L.). In a second experiment, we compared the
   effects of 7 years, of non-legume (rye (Secale cereale L.)) and legume
   (hairy vetch and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.)) cover crops
   and N fertilization (HN (90 kg N ha(-1) for tomato and 80 kg N ha(-1)
   for eggplant)) and FN (180 kg N ha(-1) for tomato and 160 kg N ha(-1)
   for eggplant) on soil organic C and N in a Greenville fine sandy loam
   (fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic, Rhodic Kandiudults) under tomato and
   eggplant (Solanum melogena L.). Both experiments were conducted from
   1994 to 2000 in Fort Valley, GA. Carbon concentration in cover crops
   ranged from 704 kg ha(-1) in hairy vetch to 3704 kg ha(-1) in rye in
   1999 and N concentration ranged from 77 kg ha(-1) in rye in 1996 to 299
   kg ha(-1) in crimson clover in 1997. With or without N fertilization,
   concentrations of soil organic C and N were greater in NT with hairy
   vetch than in MP with or without hairy vetch (23.5-24.9 vs. 19.9-21.4 Mg
   ha(-1) and 1.92-2.05 vs. 1.58-1.76 Mg ha(-1) respectively).
   Concentrations of organic C and N were also greater with rye, hairy
   vetch, crimson clover, and FN than with the control without a cover crop
   or N fertilization (17.5-18.4 vs. 16.5 Mg ha(-1) and 1.33-1.43 vs. 1.31
   Mg ha(-1), respectively). From 1994 to 1999, concentrations of soil
   organic C and N decreased by 8-16\% in NT and 15-25\% in CP and MP. From
   1994 to 2000, concentrations of organic C and N decreased by 1\% with
   hairy vetch and crimson clover, 2-6\% with HN and FN, and 6-18\% with
   the control. With rye, organic C and N increased by 3-4\%. Soil organic
   C and N concentrations can be conserved and/or maintained by reducing
   their loss through mineralization and erosion, and by sequestering
   atmospheric CO2 and N-2 in the soil using NT with cover crops and N
   fertilization. These changes in soil management improved soil quality
   and productivity. Non-legume (rye) was better than legumes (hairy vetch
   and crimson clover) and N fertilization in increasing concentrations of
   soil organic C and N. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The need to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural activities
   and to control degradation of soil structure is one of the main aims of
   land management, especially in vulnerable environments. Intensive
   cultivation of some agricultural soils can lead to deterioration in soil
   structure and other physical properties of the soil and, consequently,
   decreased crop yields. The most important modifications of soil
   structure mainly involve changes in soil porosity. Therefore,
   measurements of this physical property can help to quantify the impact
   of management practices on soil. This is now possible because of the
   increasing use and availability of the technique of image analysis which
   makes possible the automated measurement of soil porosity on thin
   sections or impregnated soil blocks prepared from undisturbed soil
   samples.
   Soil porosity is, therefore, the best indicator of soil structure
   quality. Quantification of the pore space in terms of shape, size,
   continuity, orientation and arrangement of pores in soil allows us to
   define the complexity of soil structure and to understand its
   modifications induced by management practices. In this way, we can
   identify those management practices that are more compatible with
   environmental protection. Characterisation of the pore system provides a
   realistic basis for understanding the retention and movement of water in
   soil. Significant correlations have been found between elongated
   continuous transmission pores and hydraulic conductivity that can be
   useful in the development and improvement of models for predicting water
   movement. Soil porosity shows a strong correlation with penetration
   resistance: a decrease of porosity is generally associated with an
   increase of penetration resistance. The pore shape and size distribution
   are also strictly related to chemical, biochemical and biological
   properties, like enzyme activity, and root growth.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective is to analyse the soil physical degradation in a
   test-site in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). The test-site is located in a
   semi-arid zone, where the rainfall is scarce, lower than 400 mm, and not
   well distributed throughout the crop cycles, with a strong Mediterranean
   character. Moreover, the reference evapotranspiration is elevated
   (higher than 1,000 mm year(-1)). So, irrigation is very common in this
   zone. The implementation of irrigation in the zone began 30 years ago.
   Soils of six irrigation plots were analyzed. In these plots there was a
   crop rotation: maize,barley, wheat, potato and sugar beet. These plots
   belong to a commercial farm. They have been continuously irrigated for
   twenty-five years. These soils are characterized by thin epipedons, with
   low organic matter content, and subsurface horizons with carbonate
   accumulation. On these plots an index of physical degradation of soil
   was calculated based on: crust index, structural stability and water
   holding capacity. In every case the values obtained were lower than
   0.033. These values mean a low or reduced level of physical degradation.
   The physical degradation obtained for irrigation soils is lower than the
   one for non-irrigation soils, in this zone. Since, the results show that
   the irrigation does not cause physical degradation, control and
   reclamation measures for these soils are not necessary.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of soil quality has received considerable interest as a
   measure of the environmental impact of agriculture. Such measures are
   increasingly important as agriculturalists (and their customers) move to
   include depreciation of natural capital in the assessment of farm
   performance. As a concept, soil quality has numerous advantages, but its
   application has several potential disadvantages. In particular, soil
   quality criteria are site specific and relate to the particular purpose
   of a user, unlike the criteria used to assess air and water quality.
   Soil structure is considered an important component of soil quality. The
   tablelands of south eastern Australia, where grazing of livestock is the
   dominant land use, are a significant source of surface water and
   groundwater supplies for a large part of the continent. Degrading soil
   structure will alter the relationship between infiltration and runoff,
   thereby impacting on soil erosion, pasture production and catchment
   health. A long term replicated experiment has been established at The
   University of Sydney, Orange, to determine the most appropriate tools to
   quantify changes in soil structure under alternate grazing systems. A
   number of soil properties relating to soil structure are under
   investigation, including soil hydraulic conductivity, image analysis of
   pore geometry, penetration resistance and soil microbial activity, as
   well as conventional measurements of bulk density and organic carbon.
   These methods are discussed, and results from the first year are
   reported. It is hoped that these results will enable soil structure
   change to be incorporated into grazing management decision models.}},

Abstract = {{It is estimated that an area of 33 million ha in Europe is degraded by
   soil compaction. Wheel loads still increase and compaction expands deep
   into the subsoil. Subsoil compaction is very persistent and
   possibilities of natural or artificial loosening are disappointing. The
   EU acknowledged subsoil compaction as a serious form of soil
   degradation,and financed two concerted actions on subsoil compaction.
   The concerted actions involve 49 institutes in 27 countries in whole
   Europe. Two databases were constructed: (1) on literature on subsoil
   compaction; (2) on soil mechanical properties and impact of subsoil
   compaction on soil nutrients, physical properties, crop production and
   environment. Other results of the concerted actions are two concepts for
   the determination of susceptibility of subsoils for compaction and how
   to prevent subsoil compaction. One concept is based on a deterministic
   approach taking into consideration the strength of the subsoil in
   relation to the stresses in the soil exerted by the wheel load, the
   effect of compaction on soil physical properties and rooting depth and
   crop growth, and the possibilities for loosening and natural
   recuperation. The other concept is based on an empirical approach
   considering the same aspects however based on experience. The
   deterministic approach is the scientific sound and universal way to
   determine the susceptibility to subsoil compaction and the resulting
   guidelines, recommendations and management decisions to prevent subsoil
   compaction will have accordingly a sound basis. However this
   deterministic approach requires a lot of additional data and research.
   The empirical concept lacks this sound basis and is not universal
   because it is only valid for experience with local soils, climate,
   management and crops. However it needs less additional data and research
   to formulate guidelines to prevent subsoil compaction.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction in pasture productivity is generally attributed to alterations
   in soil quality. Soil compaction due to animal trampling is one of the
   factors responsible for the degradation of the physical quality of soils
   under pasture. The objective of this study was to evaluate soil
   compaction by determining soil strength in an irrigated short-duration
   grazing system at three cow-stocking rates. The study was carried out at
   the ESALQ experimental station (University of Sao Paulo, Brazil), where
   an irrigated short-duration grazing system was established. Simultaneous
   measurements of soil strength and moisture were made in plots submitted
   to three cow-stocking rates: 5.68 animal units (AU) ha(-1), 4.42 AU
   ha(-1), and 3.50 AU ha(-1). The influence of soil moisture on soil
   strength was taken into account using regression analysis techniques.
   After this procedure the results showed that soil strength was
   significantly higher for the treatment that employed the highest
   cow-stocking rate, while similar values were obtained for the other two
   treatments.}},

Abstract = {{The Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model was
   developed for use in whole farm/small watershed management. The model
   was constructed to evaluate various land management strategies
   considering sustainability, erosion (wind, sheet, and channel),
   economics, water supply and quality, soil quality, plant competition,
   weather and pests. Management capabilities include irrigation, drainage,
   furrow diking, buffer strips, terraces, waterways, fertilization, manure
   management, lagoons, reservoirs, crop rotation and selection, pesticide
   application, grazing, and tillage. Manure may be applied as solid or
   liquid. Confined feeding areas may contain a lagoon to catch runoff from
   the feeding area plus wash water that is used in the barn. Effluent from
   the lagoon is applied automatically to a field designated for liquid
   manure application. Solid manure is scraped from the feeding area
   automatically at a user input interval in days and stockpiled for
   automatic application to designated fields. An owner may have any number
   of solid manure application fields. The model provides for application
   of manure from outside sources. These applications may be scheduled on
   certain dates or automatically at regular intervals. Manure is also
   supplied to fields by grazing animals. The manure management model is
   flexible enough to simulate a variety of systems from confined feeding
   (with or without lagoons) to grazing animals plus manure from outside
   sources. A variety of livestock including cattle, swine, and poultry may
   be considered because daily manure production in kg/head and it's
   ingredients (mineral and organic N and P) are inputs. APEX simulates
   runoff, soil erosion, and manure erosion. Routing mechanisms simulate
   soluble nutrient transport with water, organic nutrient transport by
   sediment, and manure transport by water.}},

Abstract = {{Sewage sludge were applied to degraded soils cropped with barley at the
   municipal district of Pinto (Madrid, Spain). Soil samples were analyzed
   at the end of the yield to determine the residual effects of sludge
   applications at a rate of 40 t ha(-1) on soil respiration, microbial
   biomass carbon, and enzyme activities involved in biogeochemical cycles
   of nutrients.
   The addition of organic matter with this residue caused changes in soils
   biological parameters, provoking an increase in soil microbial biomass
   and basal respiration, improving the potential microorganism activities.
   Biochemical parameters such as oxidoreductase and hydrolase enzymes were
   studied. Activities of both groups of enzymes showed an increase with
   the organic treatment. These effects showed an improvement in soil
   quality that was only significant in soils that received the organic
   treatment more recently, meanwhile the residual effects on these
   parameters three years after its application were very similar to the
   unamended soils, as a consequence of intensive mineralization processes
   under the environmental conditions in the studied area.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, manure has been recognized as an excellent soil amendment
   that can improve soil quality and provide nutrients for crop production.
   In areas of high animal density, however, repeated high applications of
   manure can lead to phosphorus (P) accumulations in soils, and migration
   of excess manure P from soils to ground and surface waters has been
   linked to eutrophication of aquatic systems. The objectives of this
   study were to determine whether the calcareous co-amendments CaO,
   Ca(OH)(2), cement kiln dust (CKD), and a cement kiln dust/fly ash
   mixture (CKD/FA) could lower the amount of extractable orthophosphate
   (ortho-P) in fresh and composted manure, and to monitor extractable
   ortho-P concentrations in cropped soils that received fresh and
   composted manure mixed with calcareous co-amendments. Extractable
   ortho-P concentrations declined by up to 37\% in fresh manure and 49\%
   in composted manure with the application of 200 g co-amendment kg(-1)
   manure (dry weight basis), and lower extractable ortho-P levels
   persisted during a 6 week laboratory incubation. In a greenhouse
   experiment, fresh manure mixed with CaO and Ca(OH)(2) co-amendments
   inhibited P uptake by barley and decreased extractable ortho-P
   concentrations in soils. Chemical and biological reactions in plant-soil
   systems led to the apparent dissolution or desorption of ortho-P from
   fresh manure mixed with CKD and CKD/FA and composted manure-co-amendment
   mixtures. Factors controlling the stability of newly formed Ca-P
   compounds in manure after they are added to plant-soil systems will
   require further study.}},

Abstract = {{Crop rotations, particularly those that include legumes, often result in
   improved soil quality and crop yields. A study was conducted to confirm
   the presence and persistence of the residual effects of crop rotation

   (moldboard plow {[}MP]; chisel plow {[}CP]; no tillage (NT]). Rotation
   (spring barley monoculture and spring barley-red clover rotation) and
   weed management (intensive, moderate, minimum) treatments, initiated in
   1987, were terminated, and a test crop of spring wheat was grown in 1995
   and 1996. Tillage treatments were maintained throughout. Multivariate
   analysis showed that weed communities were more affected by treatment
   termination in the rotation NT treatment with minimum weed management
   than in all other treatments. The former treatment was dominated by
   perennial broadleaf weeds but sustained adequate wheat yields (3.3 Mg
   ha(-1)) compared with the monoculture (1.0 Mg ha(-1)) one year after
   termination. Weed communities in CP and MP plots were less affected by
   treatment termination. Yet, changes in herbicide use at termination
   caused the virtual elimination of quackgrass from tilled plots and
   allowed field pennycress to become ubiquitous across treatments.
   Residual effects from crop rotation were more important than those from
   weed management in increasing wheat yields in tilled systems.
   Differences in wheat yield in NT systems 2 yr after treatment
   termination were attributed to residual effects from previous weed
   management rather than from crop rotation. Beneficial effects of crop
   rotation and weed management may persist for 2 yr but will vary
   according to tillage system.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial community responses to alternative management may be
   indicative of soil quality change. In this study, soils were collected
   from research plots over 2 years and from commercial grower fields over
   1 year. Treatments at the sites included 1-9 years of either winter
   cover cropping or winter fallow practices. Soils were assayed for
   microbial fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), direct count microscopy and
   Biolog substrate utilization potentials to assess management and
   environmental influences on soil communities. The strongest influence
   was season. Soils in early spring (prior to termination of the cover
   crop) utilized fewer carboxylic acids and generally were enriched in
   eukaryotic FAMEs, whereas proportionally more bacterial FAMEs were
   detected in soils at canopy closure and harvest of the summer vegetable
   crop. Within a season, community FAME and Biolog patterns were related
   to field properties. FAME profiles from grower fields in early spring
   and harvest were correlated significantly with soil texture, cation
   exchange capacity, and carbon content. Changes in community structure
   and Biolog potential occurred in some soils in response to winter cover
   crops, although effects were not observed until cover crop
   incorporation. Greater amounts of fungal and protozoan FAME markers were
   detected in some co-ver-cropped soils compared to winter fallow soils.
   Cover crop residues increased FAME diversity at one research station and
   Biolog diversity at two research stations and the grower fields.
   Although seasonal and field-dependent factors are major determinants of
   microbial community structure, shifts can occur as soil physical and
   chemical properties change in response to alternative practices, as
   demonstrated by this study.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the physical and chemical properties of feedstock
   and compost materials used at the Clear Lake Golf Course located in
   southwestern Manitoba. The compost was found to have a very low organic
   matter content (range = 9.1 to 13.2\%) and a low moisture content (27.8
   to 32.8\%). To improve the compost quality, two recommendations were
   made: (1) a composting pad should be installed to prevent soil
   contamination and (2) the moisture content should be monitored,
   particularly during the curing stage. The compost contained Hg
   concentrations ranging from 3.16 to 6.1 mg kg(-1). The grass clippings,
   the primary feedstock material, had Hg concentrations ranging from 8.53
   to 20.2 mg kg(-1). The putting green soil Hg concentration ranged from
   60.7 to 90.8 mg kg(-1). Elevated Hg levels may have been due to previous
   mercurial fungicide use and all the values were well above the Canadian
   compost and soil guideline values of 0.8 and 6.6 mg kg(-1),
   respectively. It was estimated that 104.4 kg of Hg has accumulated in
   the top 8 cm of the putting green soil, which cover an area of 9,290
   m(2). Based on a Hg flow analysis conducted on the solid materials
   entering and leaving the putting green soil, a passive remediation
   approach was recommended that involved: (1) removal of the aeration
   cores, (2) restrictions on the compost use, (3) construction of a
   composting pad, and (4) the periodic monitoring of the soil and compost
   Hg concentrations. Calculations suggested the soil would reach the soil
   quality guideline value in approximately one hundred years. This is a
   long period of time, and, as the data suggests a degree of
   bioavailability, the impact of the long-term exposure to golf course
   staff must be determined. As there are thousands of golf courses in
   North America that may have been treated with mercurial fungicide, a
   health risk assessment should be done on the Hg exposure levels during
   the handling and processing of the aeration cores and grass clippings.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable agroecosystem management generally entails increased
   management ability and input. Decision making for sustainable management
   could be enhanced by tools that provide integration and synthesis of
   soil test results, management priorities, and environmental concerns.
   Science-based soil quality indices (SQIs) may provide an ecologically
   based approach needed for land managers to make sustainable decisions.
   We developed a general approach for choosing the most representative
   indicators from large existing data sets. combining indicators into
   location-specific indices of soil quality, and using this index to
   assess agricultural management practices. We used a poultry-litter
   management case study to illustrate the design and use of this SQI.
   Site-specific indices were created using the SQI design framework for
   two sites with different soil types but similar climatic regimes. At
   each site we compared alternative poultry-litter management practices:
   land application of fresh vs. composted poultry litter. The data sets
   were composed of > 40 assays including total organic C, macro- and
   micronutrients, heavy metals, plant available water, water-stable
   aggregate, bulk density, and microbial biomass and activity.
   Multivariate statistical techniques were used to determine the smallest
   set of chemical, physical, and biological indicators that account for at
   least 85\% of the variability in the total data set at each site. We
   defined this set as the minimum data set (MDS) for evaluating soil
   quality. We evaluated the efficacy of the chosen MDS to assess
   sustainable management by performing multiple regressions of each MDS
   against numerical estimates of environmental and agricultural management
   sustainability goals (i.e., net revenues, P runoff potential. metal
   contamination, and amount of litter disposed of). Coefficients of
   determination for these regressions ranged from 0.35 to 0.91, with an
   average R(2) = 0.71. We then transformed and combined each MDS into an
   additive SQI. Index values exhibited significant differences between
   management treatments. SQI values for composted litter applied at a low
   rate were consistently highly ranked, but the relative ranking of
   treatments changed slightly due to differences in inherent soil
   properties at the two sites. Using this generalized framework allowed
   indices to be tailored to local conditions. The resulting soil quality
   index appears to be an effective monitor of sustainable management.}},

Abstract = {{The terms ``soil health{''} or ``soil quality{''} as applied to
   agroecosystems refer to the ability of soil to support and sustain crop
   growth while maintaining environmental quality. High-quality soils have
   the following characteristics: (i) a sufficient, but not excess, supply
   of nutrients; (ii) good structure (tilth); (iii) sufficient depth for
   rooting and drainage; (iv) good internal drainage; (v) low populations
   of plant disease and parasitic organisms; (vi) high populations of
   organisms that promote plant growth; (vii) low weed pressure; (viii) no
   chemicals that might harm the plant; (ix) resistance to being degraded;
   and (x) resilience following an episode of degradation. Management
   intended to improve soil health involves creatively combining a number
   of practices that enhance the soil's biological, chemical, and physical
   suitability for crop production. The most important general strategy is
   to add plentiful quantities of organic matter-including crop and cover
   crop residues, manures, and composts. Other important strategies include
   better crop rotations, reducing tillage and keeping the soil surface
   covered with living and dead residue, reducing compaction by decreasing
   heavy equipment traffic, and using best nutrient management practices.
   Practices that enhance soil quality frequently reduce plant pest
   pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) farming systems generally use excess
   tillage and produce low levels of crop residue in the potato year, both
   of which are detrimental to soil quality. In eastern Canada the major
   form of primary tillage is autumn (September-October) mouldboard
   ploughing (20 cm depth). which leaves the soil bare and unprotected over
   the winter period prior to planting potato in the following spring
   (May). A study (split-plot randomized block with six replicates) was
   initiated in 1994 on a fine sandy loam (Orthic Podzol) in Prince Edward
   Island to evaluate the use of conservation tillage in both 2-year
   {[}barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)-potato] and 3-year {[}barley-red clover
   (Trifolium pratense L.)-potato] potato rotations. The main conservation
   tillage strategy was to shift the primary tillage event from the autumn
   to spring, by replacing the autumn e mouldboard ploughing with a
   herbicide treatment, and use of a relatively shallow (15 cm depth)
   one-pass reduced tillage (chisel plough) just prior to potato planting.
   Mulches were used on all plots after potato harvest to provide soil
   cover over the cool season. Potato Yield and quality, incidence of tuber
   disease, surface residue levels after potato planting, soil organic
   carbon and carbon fractions, and soil structure were evaluated from 1994
   to 1999, over three and two cycles of the 2- and 3-year rotation,
   respectively. Results for the 2-year rotation indicated that neither
   conventional nor conservation tillage were sustainable, due to
   Rhizoctonia disease pressure and decline in tuber quality, in comparison
   to the 3-year rotation. Potato yields and tuber quality were similar
   between tillage systems in the 3-year rotation. Conservation tillage
   significantly increased the concentration of organic carbon and
   macro-organic carbon at the soil 0-8 cm depth, compared to conventional
   tillage, and significantly improved soil structural stability. Use of
   conservation tillage in 3-year potato systems has the potential to
   maintain crop productivity, protect the soil resource, and improve soil
   quality. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In view of the increasing wheel loads of agricultural vehicles, the
   question arises as to whether soil can recover from the mechanical
   impact of traffic. The damage to soil quality depends also on the soils
   resilience. This paper presents a new approach to monitoring vertical
   soil movement in situ. We assessed the effects of trafficking the soil
   with excavators and sugarbeet harvesters by monitoring surface and
   subsurface levels. The caterpillar loads of the crawlers varied from 13
   to 19 t, the wheel loads of the sugarbeet harvesters from 6 to 11 t.
   Classical geodetic levelling was used to record soil surface movement
   and a hydrostatic settlement meter measured deformation at three depths
   within the soil profile. The results of three field tests prove the
   importance of wheel load and soil moisture for soil compaction.
   Trafficking very dry soil with an excavator did not cause significant
   plastic deformation in 30 cm depth. Conversely, trafficking wet soil
   with a sugarbeet harvester led to soil sinkage of 1 to 2 cm even at 60
   cm depth. Increased wheel load in subsequent passes led to greater
   subsidence than during the first pass. Settlement decreased from the
   soil surface to deeper layers, but it remained throughout the monitoring
   period of up to 12 days. No soil recovery from plastic deformation was
   recorded within this time. The measuring system has the potential for
   long-term monitoring of the mechanical recovery of the soil,
   Additionally, it can contribute to the validation of mechanical impact
   models, which are based on soil stresses.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decades, large amounts of diffuse cadmium (Cd) and zinc
   (Zn) contaminated soil material have been deposited in the floodplains
   of the river Rhine in the Netherlands. As spatial information on soil
   quality is required at different scale levels covering the whole area,
   characterisation exclusively based on soil sampling and analysis is
   time-consuming and very expensive. A quicker method is developed based
   on a multivariate calibration procedure using partial least squares
   (PLS) regression to establish a relationship between reflectance spectra
   in the visible-near-infrared (VNIR) region and spectrally active soil
   characteristics (organic matter and clay content) that are
   inter-correlated with concentration levels of Cd and Zn. Several
   spectral pre-processing methods (normalisation, multiplicative scatter
   correction (MSC), derivation, standard normal variate (SNV) transform)
   were employed to improve the robustness and performance of the
   calibration models. No pre-processing gave the best results for Cd and
   Zn with RMSECV equal to 0.676 and 80.97 mg kg(-1), respectively.
   Application of the calibration models for soil quality characterisation
   in river floodplains is promising. The future possibilities of
   multivariate calibration and pre-processing in remote sensing have to be
   explored. (C) 2001 ElsevierScience B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil enzyme activities (beta-glucosidase, amylase, chitinase, xylanase)
   were investigated in natural and improved fallows of the semi-arid zone
   of Senegal. The effect of age (4-, 11-, and 21-year-old), management
   (fenced versus grazed), and vegetation (natural, Acacia holocericea,
   Andropogon gayanus) were compared. Principal component analysis revealed
   a relationship between enzyme activities and the age and the management
   of fallows. beta-Glucosidase and amylase activities were significantly
   higher in the oldest natural fallows. The highest xylanase activity was
   recorded for the A. gayanus improved fallows. This fallow also showed
   highest chitinase activity, similar to that of the 21-year-old natural
   fenced fallow. Amongst the different types of fallow management studied,
   the introduction of A. holocericea depleted all the tested activities.
   No relationships between enzymes activities and soil organic content,
   and total microbial biomass were evident. The reasons for the observed
   variations are discussed. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste (MSW) composts have been frequently used as N and
   C amendments to improve soil quality and to support plant growth, with
   the additional benefit of reducing waste disposal costs. However,
   attention has been paid to the risks of MSW use for the soil
   environment. The presence of heavy metals in MSW composts can affect
   some microbiological characteristics of soil such as the structure of
   the soil microbiota, which are responsible for the transformations
   making nutrients available to plants. The effects of MSW compost and
   mineral-N amendments in a 2-year field trial on some physical-chemical
   properties, some enzyme activities and the genetic diversity of cropped
   plots (sugar beet-wheat rotation) and uncropped plots were investigated.
   Variations of pH were not statistically related to MSW compost and
   mineral-N amendments, or to the presence of the crop. Amendment with MSW
   compost increased the organic C and total N contents, and dehydrogenase
   and nitrate reductase activities of soil. In cropped plots amended with
   MSW compost, dehydrogenase activity was positively correlated with
   P-glucosidase activity, and both enzyme activities with organic C
   content. No MSW compost dosage effect was detected. No effects were
   observed on denaturing gradient get electrophoresis and amplified rDNA
   restriction analysis patterns, indicating that no significant change in
   the bacterial community occurred as a consequence of MSW amendment.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of plant growth promoting (PGP) activity of bacterial
   communities recovered from each of six weed species (barnyard grass
   (Echinochloa crusfalli (L.) Beauv.), corn spurrey (Spergula arvensis
   L.), goldenrod (Sonchus sp.), Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.),
   lamb's-quarters (Chenopodium album L.), and quack grass (Agropyron
   repens (L.) Beauv.)) was examined in relation to the effect it had on
   the growth of the potato cultivar Russet Burbank. Bacterial species
   composition and community structure were compared, species-abundance
   relationships were determined, and those members conferring positive
   benefits for potato growth and development were identified. Of the
   genera identified, Bacillus, Arthrobacter, Stenotrophomonas,
   Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas were the most common, and
   Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was the most frequent species recovered
   across all sources. Significantly higher population densities were found
   in the root zones of quack grass, compared with Italian ryegrass and
   lamb's-quarters. There were no significant differences in species
   richness among the root zones; however, evenness indices (species
   distribution) were significantly lower in corn spurrey (P = 0.05).
   Significantly higher diversity indices (Hill-1 and Hill-2 numbers) (P =
   0.05) were found in the root zone soil communities of potato and
   goldenrod, indicating a decrease in the proportional abundance of common
   and very abundant species, respectively, while in barnyard grass, corn
   spurrey, and Italian ryegrass the reverse was the case. In both years of
   the study, Italian ryegrass and corn spurrey were consistently better
   sources of PGP rhizobacteria for potatoes, significantly (P < 0.001)
   increasing the mean wet weight of shoots and roots in in vitro
   bacterization studies. Barnyard grass was a consistently poor source of
   such isolates. Species-abundance measures of root zone bacterial
   biodiversity were not found, in this instance, to be a particularly good
   predictor of the presence or absence of PGP rhizobacteria. We consider
   that the study of complementary crops and soil-conditioning treatments
   should not preclude the examination of weed species as possible
   beneficials, as alterations in rhizobacterial biodiversity and
   functional versatility can influence the numbers and types of PGP
   bacterial strains, and consequently may serve to improve soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Forest dwelling browsing mammals, notably feral goats and deer, have
   been introduced to New Zealand over the past 220 years; prior to this
   such mammals were absent from New Zealand. The New Zealand forested
   landscape, therefore, presents an almost unique opportunity to determine
   the impacts of introduction of an entire functional group of alien
   animals to a habitat from which that group was previously absent. We
   sampled 30 long-term fenced exclosure plots in indigenous forests
   throughout New Zealand to evaluate community- and ecosystem-level
   impacts of introduced browsing mammals, emphasizing the decomposer
   subsystem.
   Browsing mammals often significantly altered plant community
   composition, reducing palatable broad-leaved species and promoting other
   less palatable types. Vegetation density in the browse layer was also
   usually reduced. Although there were some small but statistically
   significant effects of browsing on some measures of soil quality across
   the 30 locations, there were no consistent effects on components of the
   soil microfood web (comprising microflora and nematodes, and spanning
   three consumer trophic levels); while there were clear multitrophic
   effects of browsing on, this food web for several locations, comparable
   numbers of locations showed stimulation and inhibition of biomasses or
   populations of food web components. In contrast, all microarthropod and
   macrofaunal groups were consistently adversely affected by browsing,
   irrespective of trophic position. Across the 30 locations, the magnitude
   of response of the dominant soil biotic groups to browsing mammals (and
   hence their resistance to browsers) was not correlated with the
   magnitude of vegetation response to browsing but was often strongly
   related to a range of other variables, including macroclimatic, soil
   nutrient, and tree stand properties.
   There were often strong significant effects of browsing mammals on
   species composition of the plant community, species composition of leaf
   litter in the litter layer, and composition of various litter-dwelling
   faunal groups. Across the 30 locations, the magnitude of browsing mammal
   effects on faunal community composition was often correlated with
   browser effects on litter layer leaf species composition but never with
   browser effects on plant community composition. Browsing mammals usually
   reduced browse layer plant diversity and often also altered habitat
   diversity in the litter layer and diversity of various soil faunal
   groups. Across the 30 locations, the magnitude of browser effects on
   diversity of only one faunal group, humus-dwelling nematodes, was
   correlated with browser effects on plant diversity. However, browser
   effects on diversity of diplopods and gastropods were correlated with
   browser effects on habitat diversity of the litter layer. Reasons for
   the lack of unidirectional relationships across locations between
   effects of browsers on vegetation community attributes and on soil
   invertebrate community attributes are discussed.
   Browsing mammals generally did not have strong effects on C
   mineralization but did significantly influence soil C and N storage on
   an areal basis for several locations. However the direction of these
   effects was idiosyncratic and presumably reflects different mechanisms
   by which browsers affect soil processes. While our study did not support
   hypotheses predicting consistent negative effects of browsing mammals on
   the decomposer subsystem through promotion of plant species with poorer
   litter quality, our results still show that the introduction of these
   mammals to New Zealand has caused far-ranging effects at both the
   community and ecosystem levels of resolution, with particularly adverse
   effects for indigenous plant communities and populations of most groups
   of litter-dwelling mesofauna and macrofauna.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobically digested sewage sludges collected from four wastewater
   treatment plants located in Sha Tin, Tai Po, Yuen Long, and Shek Wu Hui
   in Hong Kong were subjected to chemical characterization and toxicity
   testing to provide preliminary assessment of their suitability for land
   application. All sewage sludges were slightly alkaline with pH range of
   8.3 - 8.7. Electrical conductivity (EC; 0.69 dS m(-1)) and soluble NH4-N
   content (996 mg kg(-1)) of sewage sludge from Yuen Long were lower than
   that of other plants. Concentrations of heavy metals were determined as
   total, extractable, and water-soluble fraction using mixed acid
   digestion, DTPA (pH 7.3), and distilled water, respectively. Yuen Long
   sludge was most polluted with Zn and Cr higher than the pollutant
   concentration limits listed in Part 503 of USEPA, owing to the effluent
   coming from the tannery industry. High concentration of Ni was found in
   sludge from Sha Tin that originated mainly from the electroplating
   industry. DTPA-extractable Zn contents were high in sludges from Yuen
   Long (1247 mg kg(-1)) and Shek Wu Hui (892 mg kg(-1)), while 3.7 mg
   kg(-1) of DTPA-extractable Cr was found in Yuen Long sludge. Metal
   speciation of sludges showed that Pb was major in residual phase while
   Cu, Cr, and Ni in organic and residual phases, and Zn did not show any
   dominant chemical phase. The sludge extracts did not exert significant
   adverse effect on seed germination of Brassica chinensis (Chinese
   cabbage), but Yuen Long sludge caused a reduction in root growth. In
   view of its lower EC and soluble ammonia contents, the high
   concentration of Zn and Cr in Yuen Long sludge would likely be
   responsible for this adverse effect on root growth. Therefore, Yuen Long
   sludge would likely have a more serious impact on soil quality and plant
   growth as compared to other sludges. This would require further
   verification from greenhouse and field experiments. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Protocol for the Derivation of Environmental and Human Health Soil
   Quality Guidelines of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the
   Environment was used to prepare preliminary Environmental Soil Quality
   Guidelines (SQG(E),) for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). A thorough
   literature search led to the compilation of the existing toxicological
   data. Calculated Environmental Soil Quality Guidelines for TNT are
   SQG(E) = 0.02 mg/kg (preliminary value) for agricultural land use and 86
   mg/kg for residential/park, commercial/industrial land use. Because of
   the lack of sufficient scientific information on the effects of TNT in
   soil on microbial processes, this type of evaluation was not possible.
   For oral toxicological data, laboratory animals were used instead of
   grazing and foraging species to determine the ingestion guideline since
   no related literature was found. Furthermore, this work has led to the
   identification of avenues of future research necessary to complete the
   task at hand. The research should focus on specific studies involving
   direct contact between the organisms and the soil, in order to: (1)
   develop a database of effects of TNT on microbial processes, (2) study
   the effects of TNT ingestion on birds and grazing herbivores, (3)
   determine plant bioconcentration factors, and (4) observe in situ the
   toxic effects after direct contact exposure.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of soil quality indicators, such as microbial biomass-C,
   soil respiration, and urease and acid phosphatase activities, in a
   laterite soil (Typic Haplustalf) amended with different doses of
   Calcutta municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) were studied over 120 days
   of incubation at 30 degreesC under 60 \% soil water holding capacity.
   The parameters were found to increase with the increase in doses of
   MSWC. Soil microbial biomass-C (MBC) and soil respiration activity
   reached peak values at 30 days of incubation and then gradually
   decreased up to 120, days of incubation. Urease and acid phosphatase
   activities showed peak values at 60 and 90 days of incubation,
   respectively. The increase in soil enzyme activities with the fall in
   MBC suggested that the release of enzymes was associated with lysis of
   microbial cells at the end of their life cycle. There was no indication
   of any detrimental effect on soil quality indicators of application of
   MSWC to soil.}},

Abstract = {{A long-term experiment comparing no-till with conventional tillage
   systems across five rotations was evaluated 11 years after initiation.
   The objectives of the present paper are (1) to report differences in
   soil chemical properties (namely soil organic matter, total nitrogen,
   phosphorus, potassium and pH) that have resulted by converting from
   conventional to no-till under contrasting cropping systems and (2) to
   draw tentative conclusions and recommendations on fertility status and
   fertilizer use and management. Soil in the no-till system had increased
   surface soil organic C levels relative to conventional tillage
   regardless of rotation. In addition, depending on the rotation, the N
   and P content of the soil improved with no-till compared with
   conventional tillage. In other words, no-till has helped to retain soil
   organic matter (SOM), conserved more N, and resulted in increased
   extractable P and exchangeable K concentrations in the upper root-zone.
   Hence, wheat produced in a no-till system may receive more nutrients
   from decomposition of SOM and acidification of the seed zone. It is
   possible that lesser amounts of fertilizer nutrients will be needed
   because of the greater efficiency of nutrient cycling in no-till systems
   relative to conventional systems. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Soil degradation by accelerated erosion is a serious problem and will
   remain so during the 21st century, especially in developing countries of
   the tropics and subtropics. Yet, its extent, severity, and economic and
   environmental impacts are debatable. Estimates of global and regional
   land area affected are tentative and subjective. Results of field
   measurements are often technique-dependent. Considerable progress has
   been made in modeling soil erosion, yet field validation of these models
   remains to be done for principal soils and ecoregions. Similar to the
   land area affected, estimates of erosional impacts on crop yield,
   productivity and soil quality are tentative and subjective. Further,
   erosion-induced losses on crop yield are scale-dependent because of the
   compensatory beneficial effects on yields from depositional sites, and
   technology-dependent because of the masking effects of input such as
   fertilizers and irrigation. Erosion caused changes in soil carbon
   dynamics and non-point source water pollution are important
   environmental impacts. While erosion (e.g., detachment and transport)
   can lead to emission of trace gases into the atmosphere, deposition can
   bury and sequester some of the carbon. In addition to improving the
   database on the land area affected, there is also a need to assess
   erosional impacts on productivity and soil C balance at the watershed,
   regional, and global scale. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality research has focused on intensively managed agricultural
   and forest soils, but the concept and importance of soil quality is also
   pertinent to reclaimed mine soils and other disturbed ecosystems. Adding
   organic amendments has been used as a means for ameliorating mine soils
   and improving their quality, but the long-term effects of amendments on
   soil quality are not known. In 1982, a mined site was amended with seven
   different surface treatments: a control (nothing added), 30 cm of native
   soil, 112 Mg ha(-1) sawdust, and municipal sewage sludge (SS) at rates
   of 22, 56, 112, and 224 Mg ha(-1). Four replicates of each treatment
   were installed as a randomized complete block design. Each plot was
   split and planted with pitch X loblolly pine hybrid (Pinus rigida X
   taeda) trees and Kentucky-31 tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.).
   During the 16-yr period, organic matter content, total organic N, N
   mineralization potential, aggregate stability, and other physical and
   chemical properties were measured as mine soil quality indicators. The
   comparative ability of these organic amendments to positively affect
   organic matter content, total N, and other parameters was most apparent
   and pronounced after 5 yr. However, after 16 yr, soil organic matter
   (SOM) content and total N appeared to be equilibrating at approximate to
   10 000 and 750 kg ha(-1), respectively. Organic matter inputs by
   vegetation alone across the 16-yr period in the control plots resulted
   in organic matter and N mineralization potential values comparable to
   levels in the organically-amended plots, indicating the overriding
   importance of vegetation in the soil recovery process. After 16 yr,
   there appears to be no lasting soil quality improvements due to addition
   of organic amendments to this mine soil. Amendments improved short-term
   production, but their cost of transport and application may be difficult
   to justify based on long-term soil quality improvement.}},

Abstract = {{The present study demonstrates the development of crop specific land
   quality index (LQI) for sorghum {[}sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] under
   semiarid tropics of India. The method developed as LQI is a function of
   climatic quality index (CQI) and soil quality index (SQI). The CQI
   defined as growth index was derived from the compound product of water
   satisfaction index and radiation index. The SQI was developed as
   multiple attributes of soil properties related to sorghum suitable soil
   quality such as soil depth, available water capacity (AWC), drainage and
   slope. The LQI was correlated with the actual sorghum yield obtained
   from benchmarks soils and it was found that LQI bears good agreement
   with the yield. From the yield correlation, the LQI class has been fixed
   as LQI value < 1.0 rated as high, 1-1.5 as moderate and > 1.5 as low
   corresponding to the maximum attainable yield of > 50\%, 40-50\% and
   less than < 40\%, respectively. The study also indicated that CQI value
   of < 0.25 and SQI value of < 5 correspond to good sorghum growing area.
   Finally, the isoline maps of CQI and SQI maps were superimposed through
   TYDAC-SPAN-GIS system to arrive at LQI class map. The map indicates that
   out of a total area under sorghum (11.7 m ha), 43\% falls under high LQI
   class, and 38\% under moderate, and 19\% under low LQI class. The
   moderate and low LQI areas need proper rehabilitation measures for
   increasing sorghum yield. The LQI developed may help in planning and
   management of soils not only under Indian SAT but also in areas of
   similar soil and climatic conditions occurring elsewhere. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Polyclonal antisera were raised against cell walls of a soil aggregating
   basidiomycete isolated in eastern Montana (isolate BB1) which has been
   identified as a member of the russuloid clade using molecular genetic
   techniques. In cross-reactivity tests using quantitative enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polyclonal antisera to BB I cross-reacted
   significantly with fungal species representative of the russuloid clade
   and little or no reactivity was observed with fungal species of the
   polyporoid, euagaric, hymenochaetoid, bolete and gomphoid-phalloid
   clades of the Homobasidiomycetes. These results suggested that the cell
   walls of fungal species from the russuloid clade share common antigenic
   binding sites that are recognizable by the polyclonal antibodies and
   that these sites were not found or were present in small amounts in
   fungal species from the other clades. Experiments on the water stability
   of artificial aggregates amended with fungal species representative of
   these six homobasidiomycete clades indicated that many species of the
   russuloid clade were very efficient soil stabilizers. Fungal species
   from the other clades vary in their ability to aggregate soil particles
   but cross-react weakly with the antibodies. ELISA was used on water
   stable aggregates (WSA) from soil samples of three dryland locations
   under conventional tillage, no tillage and fallow management practices
   and on WSA from soil samples from grass barrier strips that were
   undisturbed for 30 years. Greater antigenic response was observed from
   WSA of undisturbed soils compared to cultivated soils and from WSA of
   soils under no till compared to till or fallow management practices.
   These results suggested that specific soil aggregating russuloids in WSA
   are sensitive to soil disturbance such as tillage. To our knowledge,
   this study is the first report of the detection and quantification of a
   taxonomic group of specific soil aggregating Homobasidiomycetes in
   dryland soils under diverse agricultural systems. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{There is a strong link between desertification of the drylands and
   emission of CO(2) from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere. Thus,
   there is a strong need to revisit the desertification process so that
   its reversal can lead to C sequestration and mitigation of the
   accelerated greenhouse effect. Drylands of the world occupy 6.31 billion
   ha (Bha) or 47\% of the earth's land area distributed among four
   climates: hyper-arid (1.0 Bha), arid (1.62 Bha), semi-arid (2.37 Bha)
   and dry sub-humid (1.32 Bha). Principal soils of drylands are Aridisols
   (1.66 Bha), Entisols (1.92 Bha), Alfisols (0.38 Bha), Vertisols (0.21
   Bha) and others (1.27 Bha). Drylands occur in all continents covering
   2.01 Bha in Africa, 2.00 Bha in Asia, 0.68 Bha in Australia, 1.32 Bha in
   the Americas and 0.30 Bha in Europe. Desertification, degradation of
   soil and vegetation in drylands resulting from climatic and
   anthropogenic factors, affects about 1.137 Bha of soils and an
   additional 2.576 Bha of rangeland vegetation. The rate of
   desertification is estimated at 5.8 million hectares (Mha) per year.
   Desertification is a biophysical process (soil, climate and vegetation)
   driven by socio-economic and political factors. The principal
   biophysical processes involved, accelerated soil erosion by water and
   wind and salinization, reduce soil quality and effective rooting depth,
   decrease vegetal cover, reduce biomass productivity, and accentuate
   vagaries of climate especially low and variable rainfall. Major
   consequences of desertification include reduction in the total soil C
   pool and transfer of C from soil to the atmosphere. Total historic loss
   of C due to desertification may be 19 to 29 Pg. The rate of C emission
   from drylands due to accelerated soil erosion is estimated at 0.227 to
   0.292 Pg C y(-1). Therefore, desertification control and restoration of
   degraded soils and ecosystems would improve soil quality, increase the
   pool of C in soil and biomass, and induce formation of secondary
   carbonates leading to a reduction of C emissions to the atmosphere.
   Desertification control and soil restoration are affected by
   establishing vegetative cover with appropriate species, improving water
   use efficiency, using supplemental irrigation including water
   harvesting, developing a strategy of integrated nutrient management for
   soil fertility enhancement, and adopting improved farming systems.
   Adoption of these improved practices also have hidden carbon costs,
   especially those due to production and application of herbicides and
   nitrogen fertilizers, pumping irrigation water etc. Restoration of
   eroded and salt-affected soils is important to C sequestration. Total
   potential of C sequestration in drylands through adoption of these
   measures is 0.9 to 1.9 Pg C y(-1) for a 25- to 50-year period beyond
   which the rate of sequestration is often too low to be important. In
   addition to enhancing productivity and food security, C sequestration in
   soils and ecosystem has numerous ancillary benefits. Therefore,
   identification and implementation of policies is important to facilitate
   adoption of recommended practices and for commodification of carbon.}},

Abstract = {{Topsoil is an essential component for land reclamation in mining areas.
   It is seriously damaged if it is not mined out separately without being
   contaminated, eroded and protected. Systematic handling and storage
   practices can protect topsoil while in storage and after it has been
   redistributed onto the regraded area. Impact of coal mining on topsoil
   quality in Indian context has been described. Systematic removal of
   topsoil, its storage practice, geometry of topsoil heap are discussed in
   this study. Removed topsoil should be reclaimed technically and its
   shelf-life period should be ascertained. To assess the shelf-life
   period, an investigation was conducted in a large opencast coal project.
   Soil dumps of different age classes in the area were identified and
   analyzed critically to evaluate the deterioration of soil quality with
   respect to time, and compared with those of unmined areas. Changes in
   soil quality showed a continuous decrease every year and ultimately
   became biologically sterile. Biological reclamation is essential if the
   soil is to be stored beyond the shelf-life period. Preservation of
   stockpiled topsoil, its redistribution on the regraded areas, nutrients
   and amendments to be added, are discussed briefly in this study.}},

Abstract = {{The activity and biomass of soil microorganisms were measured in soils
   from 25 different arable sites in the Pacific region of Nicaragua with
   the objective of elucidating their interrelationship with soil textural
   and soil chemical properties. All soils developed from recent volcanic
   deposits but differ in their particle size distribution. Short-term
   phosphorus fixation capacity varied widely and was, on average, 11\% of
   added P. In contrast, long-term P fixation capacity varied within a
   small range of around 55\%. Mean basal respiration was 8.6 mug CO2-C
   d(-1) g(-1) soil, average contents of biomass C, biomass P, and
   ergosterol as an indicator of fungal biomass were 116, 1.95, and 0.34
   mug g(-1) soil, respectively, They were all, except biomass P,
   significantly lower in the sandy than in the loamy soils. The mean
   biomass C-to-soil C ratio was 0.69\%, the mean metabolic quotient 95 Mg
   CO2-C d(-1) g(-1) biomass C, the mean ergosterol-to-biomass C ratio
   0.31\% and the mean biomass C-to-P ratio 107. The very low
   ergosterol-to-biomass C ratio indicates that fungi contribute only a
   relatively small percentage to the microbial biomass. The biomass C-to-P
   ratio exceeded considerably the soil C-to-total P ratio. Metabolic
   quotient qCO(2) and ergosterol-to-biomass C were both negatively
   correlated with biomass C-to-soil C ratio and clay content, indicating
   positive correlations between qCO(2) and ergosterol-to-biomass C ratio
   and between biomass C-to-soil C ratio and clay content. Key problems of
   soil fertility and soil quality in Nicaragua are low availability of
   soil organic matter and phosphorus to soil microorganisms, which are
   magnified by a low percentage of fungi, probably reducing the ability of
   soil to provide nutrients for plant growth. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{We measured the activity and soil microbial biomass in volcanic ash
   soils from 10 sites under ecological fanning (no pesticides, shallow
   ploughing, mulching, organic fertilizers, crop rotation) and 15 sites
   under conventional farming (pesticides, mineral fertilizers, deep
   ploughing). Our aim was to determine the effects of management system on
   soil quality and soil fertility in tropical Nicaragua in relation to
   soil type. None of these sites were irrigated. Conventional management
   led to significantly increased amounts of total soil P and a
   significantly larger biomass C-to-P ratio compared to ecological
   management. Almost all of the other microbial properties, i.e. soil
   basal respiration, ergosterol and biomass C were significantly improved
   by ecological management. Also the biomass C-to-soil C ratio was
   significantly increased, but not the metabolic quotient qCO(2) or the
   ergosterol-to-biomass C ratios, indicating that the positive effects of
   ecological management were mainly due to increased C input rates.
   Biomass C, ergosterol, and basal respiration rate were significantly
   larger at the loamy sites than at the sandy sites, The same was true for
   the biomass C-to-soil C ratio, but the ergosterol-to-biomass C ratio and
   the metabolic quotient qCO(2) were larger at the sandy sites. Our
   results demonstrate that ecological management is an important tool for
   soil conservation and sustainable management of arable land in
   Nicaragua. However, the decline in total P and the low P availability to
   soil microorganisms need attention as a precaution against P deficiency.
   The improvement was greatest at the loamy sites, although the effects of
   management system were in most cases independent of the soil type. For
   this reason, ecological management should be preferably promoted on
   loamy soils. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the residual effects of 4 or 5 years of previous
   cropping regimes, which included grasses, legumes and fallow, each with
   or without annual nitrogen (N) fertilization, at three locations in
   Alaska. At two locations, some previous management practices, especially
   fallow and in some cases N fertilization, resulted in increased yields
   of subsequent cereal crops. These effects disappeared by the second year
   of the study. Significant effects were not found at a third site. Soil
   bulk density, organic carbon (C) and N, and microbial biomass C and N
   were not affected by previous treatments. Soil wet aggregate stability,
   pH, and mineralizable C and N were significantly affected in at least
   one location by previous cropping or N fertilization. Effects of
   previous management had disappeared or were diminished by the autumn of
   the year following cessation of the treatment. These results indicate
   that effects due to past cropping history may be short lived in
   subarctic agricultural soils.}},

Abstract = {{Different functional groups of soil arthropodofauna present in the
   agro-ecosystem can be severely modified by tillage practices. The
   abundance of different trophic groups subject to conventional tillage
   (CT) and no tillage (NT) practices were evaluated compared to a natural
   field boundary (FB) in a wheat crop. Arthropods were captured using
   pitfall traps and collected every 20 days during 10 months, and grouped
   according to their habits in predators, phytophagous and detritivorous.
   Tillage systems affected the abundance of arthropod fauna and the
   proportion between different functional groups as regards a FB.
   Predators constituted the most abundant group of all arthropods
   captured, and their number was higher under NT than under CT. In CT, an
   increase in predators was observed only in spring, probably associated
   with a recolonisation from the adjacent plots of NT. Phytophagous was
   the least representative group in the three evaluated systems, it was
   higher under cropped plots (NT and CT) than in the FB, and was not
   affected by tillage practices.
   Under NT, the number of predators, remained higher along the crop
   development. Phytophagous activity in no till plots remains constant. In
   FB, the number of captured individuals was lower and relatively stable
   along the whole sampling period than in the cultivated plots.
   Ploughing action (CT plots) provoked a decrease in the relative
   importance of predators and an increase in phytophagous as regards those
   in NT and FB. Total biomass of captured arthropod fauna showed
   significant differences between treatments, being higher in NT and lower
   in CT plots.
   It is concluded that tillage systems affect not only the abundance of
   arthropod fauna but also the proportion between different functional
   groups. The consequences of these changes for soil quality are discussed
   later on. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have succeeded in applying laser-induced shockwave plasma
   spectroscopy (LISPS) to the problem of the detection and analysis of
   metal elements deposited from water samples by means of electrolysis. It
   is shown that metal elements are generally deposited in the form of a
   thin film on the electrode surface, while the electrode also
   conveniently serves as a subtarget for the relatively soft metal film,
   thereby providing the necessary conditions for the generation of
   shockwave plasma, which is favorable for highly sensitive
   spectrochemical analysis. It is shown that the detection sensitivity of
   this method reaches its highest value at low surrounding air pressure of
   around 1 torr. The lowest detection limit attained for various metal
   elements investigated in this experiment varies from around ten to a few
   tens or ppb. This limit can be readily improved upon by incorporating an
   optical multichannel analyzer into the detection system. We have thus
   presented a promising method for the realization of a compact mobile
   monitoring system for the accurate control of water and soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Soil survey data are required for different kinds of environmental and
   agronomic studies, especially for estimating general soil quality
   indicators such as Available Water Capacity (AWC) over large areas.
   Generally, AWC estimates take the form of a unique value per soil class,
   and the uncertainty pervading these estimates is not assessed, although
   it is of crucial importance for the users. To overcome this problem
   without requiring expensive-to-measure data, we propose an alternative
   approach which estimates AWC from two different types of information
   currently available in soil databases: (i) imprecise descriptions of
   soil classes, i.e. synthesis profiles or qualitative descriptions of
   soil classes, (ii) pedotransfer functions and other statistical
   relations between input soil properties.
   The imprecise descriptions of soil classes were considered as sets of
   fuzzy intervals of values of soil properties and represented by
   possibility distributions. Statistical relations were translated into
   fuzzy relations of soil properties by applying a
   ``probability-to-possibility{''} transformation. AWC was then estimated
   by means of a fuzzy interval calculus that was implemented as a
   Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), allowing the representation of
   relations between the variables. AWC estimates were expressed by
   possibility distributions that were translated into a set of prediction
   intervals corresponding to different possibility levels. The approach
   was applied to the estimation of the AWC from soil class descriptions
   from three detailed soil maps in the Languedoc plain (southern France).
   The validation study demonstrated that the proposed approach provided
   reliable but fairly imprecise estimates, which allows the soil classes
   to be ranked with respect to the AWC. The best reliability-precision
   compromise was obtained at possibility level of 0.8 by using qualitative
   descriptions as a data source. Because it only uses currently available
   information of soil databases, the proposed approach can be extensively
   used in the future for regional applications which allow for a certain
   amount of (known) imprecision, or in studies aimed at defining
   improvements to existing soil databases. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BY.

Abstract = {{Soil management systems that encourage the formation and stabilization
   of recalcitrant clay-humic complexes will have the greatest long-term
   impact on C sequestration and soil quality. The objective of this study
   was to determine the relationship between the chemical, biochemical, and
   spectroscopic characteristics of humic substances and clay mineralogy.
   Clay-humic complexes were separated from the Ap horizon of a Webster
   soil (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Typic Endoaquoll) by an invasive
   sonication-centrifugation technique. The samples were analyzed for
   mineralogy by XRD (x-ray diffraction), chemical composition by
   inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectorscopy (ICP-AES), C and
   N by thermal combustion, C chemistry by solid state C-13 magic angle
   spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS-NMR) and both gas
   chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
   analyses of extractable organic compounds. The coarse, medium, and fine
   clay fractions are dominated by quartz, a low-charged interstratified
   phase, and smectite, respectively. Extractable organic compounds, 30 to
   52\% of the total C, are dominated by basic amino acids and
   polyunsaturated fatty acids. Less than 3\% of the extractable C is
   monosaccharides and amino sugars and only trace levels of phenolic acids
   were found. The C/N ratios of humic substances associated with the
   coarse, medium, and fine clay fractions are 17, 10, and 10,
   respectively. The coarse clay fraction has stronger carboxyl and 0-alkyl
   C-13-NMR peaks and lower levels of extractable amino acids, fatty acids,
   monosaccharides, and amino sugars than humics associated with the fine
   clay fraction. The results indicate that the biochemistry of the
   clay-humic complexes differs substantially from that of whole soils and
   that soil clay mineralogy strongly influences humification.}},

Abstract = {{The most stable forms of organic matter in soils are the clay-humic
   complexes. An understanding of mechanisms and processes influencing the
   formation of clay-humic complexes may facilitate development of
   agricultural management systems that increase the long-term
   sequestration of C in soils and improve soil quality. The specific
   objective of this study was to visualize associations between humic
   substances and clay minerals separated from a typical agricultural soil.
   The soil sample used in this study was from the Ap horizon of a Webster
   (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquoll) soil located
   near Waseca, MN. The whole soil clay fraction (<2 mum particle-size
   fraction) was separated by a relatively mild sedimentation technique,
   and coarse, medium, and fine clay fractions (0.2-2.0, 0.02-0.2, and
   <0.02 lm size fractions, respectively) were separated from a portion of
   the whole clay sample by an aggressive sonication-centrifugation
   technique. All samples were Ca-saturated, dialyzed, and freeze-dried.
   The samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy to obtain
   images of clay-humic complexes and energy dispersive x-ray analysis to
   obtain maps of elemental distributions. Two distinct types of
   clay-associated humic substances were identified. The first type exists
   as diffuse filamentous films that cover basal surfaces of 2:1
   phyllosilicates in the medium and fine clay fractions. The second type
   exists as discrete particles of high-density metal-humic substance
   complexes in the coarse clay fraction.}},

Abstract = {{Soil redistribution from tillage and water erosion have the potential to
   modify the spatial patterns of soil quality on terraced and steep

   relationship. Our objectives were to quantify soil quality parameters
   along terraced and steep hillslopes and determine the relationship
   between soil redistribution from tillage erosion and water erosion on
   soil quality parameters in the Chinese Loess Plateau. Soil quality
   indicators, i.e., soil organic matter (OM), available P, N, bulk density
   (D-b), and clay and silt contents were measured at 5-m intervals on a
   terraced field and at 10-m intervals on a steep cultivated hillslope in
   a down slope transect. Soil redistribution rates from tillage and
   overland flow were obtained by Cs-137 technique integrated with a
   tillage erosion prediction model (TEP). Water erosion was the primary
   cause for the overall decline in soil quality on the steep cultivated
   hillslope while tillage erosion had a comparable contribution to overall
   level in soil quality on the terraced hillslope. Soil movement by
   tillage controlled the spatial patterns in OM, N, and P on both terraced
   and steep cultivated hillslopes. Selective removal of finer particles by
   water erosion caused a linear decrease in clay content of 0.02\% m(-1)
   and corresponding increase in silt content of 0.04\% m(-1) downslope on
   the steep cultivated hillslope. The impact of tillage erosion on OM, N,
   and P on the steep cultivated hillslope can be assessed using the change
   in adjacent slope gradients (X) through a soil quality-topography
   regression model, Y = aX + b.}},

Abstract = {{Pure spruce stands are unsatisfactory, especially from the ecological
   point of view. Therefore, attempts are being made to convert these into
   mixed forests by planting groups of beech under the canopy of the spruce
   forests. In this study the invertebrate fauna of such 20 and 40-year-old
   beech groups, pure spruce stands and deciduous stands are compared to
   see how far the young beech groups have already influenced the coenosis
   of spruce forests. The analysis was based upon 3 ecological guilds:
   Saprophagous macroinvertebrates, epigeic predators and predators of the
   trunk area. The study shows that while spruce stands are not barren
   deserts, they do contain less species and individuals than deciduous
   stands. As a result, the reconversion of spruce forests remains an
   important task in forest management. The beech groups are species richer
   than the spruce stands. However, the tree species are not the only
   important factor, the structure and the size of the groups are also of
   significance. Furthermore, other tree species such as Quercus, Via, Acer
   and Fraxinus as well as successional tree species may possibly promote
   diversity and accelerate the improvement of soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reviews eight well-known and accepted pedo-transfer functions
   used for evaluation of soil hydraulic conductivity (saturated and
   unsaturated) from routinely available soil data. A comprehensive data
   set containing detailed measurements of 63 German soil horizons, to
   which none of the models had been previously calibrated, were used for
   the evaluation of pedo-transfer functions. The paper considers only
   pedo-transfer functions which have shown good results in the past.
   The statistical analysis of the eight functions shows that the model of

   quality. In: E.G., Gregorich, M.R., Carter, (Eds.), Soil Quality for
   Crop Production and Ecosystem Health. Developments in Soils Science,
   vol. 25, Elsevier, (1997) 221-245.], which requires an input of measured
   saturated hydraulic conductivity, performs best in terms of prediction
   of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Evaluation of the unsaturated
   hydraulic conductivity by the pedo-transfer functions shows, on average,
   better correlations if the saturated hydraulic conductivity tan input
   parameter) is also obtained from predictions of pedo-transfer functions
   rather than directly from experiments. This outcome is attributed to a
   dependence of the saturated hydraulic conductivity on soil structure,
   i.e. macropores, while the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is
   generally more dependent on soil texture. The deviating results of
   estimated soil hydraulic conductivity, as compared to the experimental
   data, indicate that the use of pedo-transfer functions based only on
   estimated soil hydraulic parameters must be carried out with great
   caution. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Low organic matter concentration coupled with low native soil phosphorus
   (P) concentrations is a major constraint limiting the productivity of a
   soybean-wheat system on Vertisols in the Indian semi-arid tropics. In a
   3-year field study (1996-99), the performance of four different composts
   obtained from legume straw (Glycine max Merr.L), cereal straw (Triticum
   aestivum), oilseed straw (Brassica juncea L.) and city rubbish were
   compared, and also with chemical fertilizers in terms of degree of
   maturity, quality of compost, improvement in soil organic matter,
   biological activities of soil and yields of soybean and wheat.
   Phospho-sulpho-nitrocomposts (phosphocomposts) were prepared containing
   approximately 2.5 to 4.2\% P and 1.4 to 2.3\% N, in an aerobic
   decomposition process for 4 months by adding an aqueous slurry of 1:1
   (dry weight) cow dung, 2.2\% P in the form of low grade Mussorie
   phosphate rock (7.5\% P), 10\% pyrite (S, 22.2\%) and 0.5\% urea N, and
   bioinoculums such as the cellulose decomposers Paecilomyces fusisporus
   and Aspergillus awamori, and P-solubilizing organisms i.e. Bacillus
   polymyxa and Pseudomonas striata. The maturity indexes were strongly
   associated with the source of materials, chemical composition and degree
   of decomposition, The matured composts had lower C/N ratios (8.2 to
   21.7) and water soluble carbohydrates (0.23 to 0.43\%) and larger ratios
   of cation exchange capacity/total organic carbon (CEC/TOC) and
   lignin/cellulose than the initial. The matured compost increased total
   P, water soluble P, citrate soluble P, total N and NO(3)-N and the
   application of phosphocompost at the rate of 10 t/ha gave plant growth
   dry matter accumulation, seed yield and P uptake by soybean equivalent
   to single superphosphate at 26.2 kg P/ha. The continuous turnover of
   enriched phosphocompost increased soil microbial biomass C and the
   activity of enzymes compared to application of chemical fertilizer.}},

Abstract = {{Severe erosion, initiated by climatic changes during the Late
   Pleistocene-Early Holocene period and resultant declines in dust
   deposition, causes the formation of waterfalls during the winter floods
   in many wadi systems in the central Negev desert of Israel, In some
   areas, erosion of the original loess substrate has been complete, so
   that the underlying rock has been exposed. We examined the effects of
   this erosion in four wadis in the central Negev desert on soil
   nutrients, plant community structure and plant quality. We predicted
   that erosion has caused reductions in soil nutrients. Reductions in soil
   nutrients should result in reductions in plant cover. Furthermore,
   reduced soil nutrient availability should cause reductions in the
   nutrient status and quality of the plants growing there. In addition to
   the loss of biodiversity that may result, this erosion may result in
   economic hardship for the Bedouin peoples whose herds depend on these
   resources. In this study, there were significant negative effects of
   erosion on soil organic carbon, nitrate nitrogen and water-holding
   capacity, but not on soil phosphorus, conductivity or pH. Furthermore,
   there was a negative effect of soil erosion on an overall measure of
   soil quality derived from a principal components analysis in three of
   the four wadis we studied. Erosion resulted in an increase in plant
   species richness and significantly altered plant community structure in
   eroded areas of wadis. Increased plant species richness in eroded sites
   is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis of plant
   community structure. Plants growing in eroded areas did not differ in
   two quality indices (nitrogen content and digestibility), although
   plants typical of eroded areas had significantly lower levels of common
   digestion inhibitors (total polyphenols) and toxins (alkaloids) than
   plants from undisturbed sites. These last-mentioned results are contrary
   to our prediction and are consistent with the notion that plants growing
   in disturbed (e.g. eroded) sites maximize growth at the expense of
   investments in defense. (C) 2001 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Human activity in the environment has great impact on soil ecology.
   However recent knowledge on properties of anthropogenic soils is still
   scarce. For this reason the purpose of this paper is to deliver data on
   the soil organic matter (SOM) properties of urban soils with an example
   from the city of Rostock (Northeast Germany) and to describe the
   environmental consequences of severe anthopogenic actvity. The results
   suggest that SOM of urban settings is significantly different in their
   chemical nature of humic compounds and their coal contents. The lower
   content of alkyl C and the simultaneously higher contents of aromatic C
   moieties in urban soils compared to their natural counterparts suggest a
   substantially different biochemical behavior against environmental
   hazardous compounds and microbial activity. This knowledge is essential
   for a qualitative assessment of important biochemical mechanisms in
   urban soils.}},

Abstract = {{Compaction significantly reduces yield, quality, and profitability of
   irrigated crops in the US Pacific Northwest (PNW). Compaction assessment
   is usually done via bulk density measurement, even though crops respond
   negatively to excessive compaction largely because of root penetration
   (soil strength) limitations, not because of bulk density per se. For
   most soils, strength is thought to depend primarily on the interaction
   of water content and bulk density. We hypothesized that the soil
   strength (expressed as cone index) of an important PNW soil, Portneuf
   silt loam (Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcid), could be predicted for a given
   bulk density or water content and that it would increase with increasing
   bulk density and decreasing water content. To test this, the in situ
   cone index, the bulk density and water content profile of a 1.5-ha field
   was intensively sampled three times over a 2-year period, producing 688
   data triplets. These data were used to produce soil water strength-bulk
   density response surface relationships using robust curve fitting. Cone
   index relationships were poor when derived from full-profile data sets
   but improved when data were segregated by depths. When grouped by depth
   intervals, cone indices of individual layers were always correlated
   strongly with soil water content, but not always with bulk density. The
   high calcium carbonate content of this soil was thought to have produced
   cementation effects on the cone index that varied with prolonged wetting
   versus prolonged drying. Variability among in situ strength penetrations
   and bulk density cores was also thought to reduce model accuracy. The
   difficulties inherent in developing the comprehensive relationships of
   soil strength to bulk density, and the overriding dependency of strength
   on the dynamic variable of water content, suggest great uncertainty when
   using bulk density sampling for realistic assessment of overall soil
   status affecting root restriction or crop performance unless sampling is
   extensive and the relationships between strength, bulk density, and
   water content have been intensively documented for an individual soil.}},

Abstract = {{The International Soil and Tillage Research Organization (ISTRO) was
   initiated in 1955 as an activity of the World Ploughing Organization
   holding the world ploughing contests. The membership of ISTRO has grown
   from a dozen agricultural engineers and soil scientists in western
   Europe in the 1950s to 450 members from around the world in 2000.
   Thematic evolution of ISTRO has addressed four distinct but
   inter-related issues: (i) ploughing, mechanization and energy/power
   requirements during the 1950s and 1960s; (ii) reduced ol conservation
   tillage and mulch farming during the 1970s, and soil compaction, soil
   strength and soil tilth during the 1980s; (iii) agricultural
   sustainability and soil quality in the 1990s; (iv) greenhouse effect,
   environment quality and modeling in the year 2000 and beyond. The ISTRO
   and its members will continue to play an important role in meeting the
   ever-increasing food demand of the growing human population of the world
   without jeopardizing soil and water resources that an already under
   great stress. A possible future strategy lies in understanding the
   processes and establishing the cause-effect relationship which create
   synergistic effects in enhancing productivity per unit input of land,
   labor, energy and time. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Before the arrival of European agricultural technology, technologies
   addressing the need for more efficient capture and utilisation of
   resources were being developed in Africa. Land invasions and
   displacements, the introduction of technologies more suited to European
   conditions, and increased use of the mouldboard plough and hand hoc
   slowed and almost halted this revolution. In recent decades farmers have
   in some areas regained security of tenure, recognised the potential
   value of indigenous knowledge, and begun to understand the degradation
   caused by soil inversion and other `modern' technologies. Conservation
   tillage is defined as any cropping system which results in conservation
   of natural or other resources, and sustainable agriculture as the use of
   agricultural practices which conserve water and soil and are
   environmentally non-degrading, technically appropriate, economically
   viable and socially acceptable. Synergising of the will, findings and
   knowledge of African farmers and agriculturists with the experience and
   understanding of other conservation tillage researchers, advisers and
   practitioners throughout the world has resulted in this agrarian
   revolution gathering momentum. The potential contributions of
   conservation tillage to sustainable agriculture, and the role of the
   African Conservation Tillage (ACT) network in assisting and facilitating
   the process, and identifying and prioritising research needs, are
   discussed. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   factories and thermal power plants on the quality of water in lakes,
   tanks, ponds, even well waters in relation to its use in the welfare of
   the society (agricultural use, psciculture and other domestic uses). The
   results showed that intensity of acidity (water pH) as well as
   concentration of various soluble salts and BOD and COD in the vicinity
   of an industrial area (i.e. within 100 metres) were very low. A
   substantially higher acidity and ion concentration were recorded up to I
   km away from industry, where the growth of aquatic plants, organisms and
   the production of fish (in lakes and tanks) were severely affected. The
   results further indicated that the acidity of water gradually increases
   up to pH 5.4 and concentration of sulphates and chlorides (880 and 570
   mg l(-1) respectively) between 1-2 km from the industry, suggesting that
   aquatic ecosystems and domestic, agricultural and fish production are
   less affected with increasing distance from industry.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in soil acidity and in biodiversity were analysed in the
   National Natural Park ``Russian North{''}, European Russia. Improving
   soil quality from podzol, podzolic soil, derno-podzolic soil, brown
   earth to pararendzina leads to increase in diversity and changes in
   floristical composition, followed by changing of pine and spruce forest
   to mixed and birch forests. In PCA ordination species diversity,
   richness and evenness of trees, shrubs and vascular plants are closely
   connected with each other, and are represented by the first principal
   component. They are strongly correlated to the thickness of Al horizon,
   pH(H2O) and pH(CaCl2) in organic, surface and subsurface mineral
   horizons. Only bryophyte species richness and diversity are directly
   related to the thickness and weight of organic horizon, soil
   exchangeable acidity, and inversely related to the thickness of Al
   horizon and pH. Thus, the ordination of the major species diversity
   variables is highly related to soil pH, suggesting that pH is the best
   soil related predictor of species diversity parameters. Our study shows
   that plants notably respond to soil acidification in boreal forest
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulated vegetative residue was a concern when Conservation Reserve
   Program (CRP) land returned to grain crop production. This study was
   conducted to determine the effect of residue management, tillage, and
   crop choice on grain yield in the first year of cropping on CRP land
   that was predominately smooth brome (Bromis inermis Leyss). Three
   residue management practices (undisturbed, shred, and remove), three
   tillage systems {[}moldboard plow, disk, and no till], and three crops
   (corn (Zea mays L.), soybean {[}Glycine mar (L.) Merr.], and grain
   sorghum {[}Sorghum bicolor (L,) Moench]\} were used in a factorial
   arrangement of a 3-yr field experiment conducted in Nebraska on
   fine-silty, mixed, mesic Udic Haplustoll; fine-silty, mixed
   (calcareous), mesic Typic Ustorthent; and fine-silty, mixed, mesic
   Cumolic Halustoll soils, Residue management was not significant for corn
   (P > F = 0.16), sorghum (P F = 0.113), and soybean (P > F = 0.491)
   although there were significant residue x tillage interactions. Tillage
   system was not significant (P > F = 0.125) for soybean yields, but
   plowing significantly (P > F = 0.0001) increased both corn and sorghum
   yields. Mean corn yields were 13\% less for the no-till system than for
   the moldboard plow system. However, no-till corn yield differences were
   not significant (P > F = 0.255) when plant population (a possible
   measure of planter performance) and percent green rating (a measure of
   weed control) were included as covariates. Our recommendation for the
   first year of grain crop production on smooth brome CRP land is to shred
   the residue and plant soybean in a no-till system.}},

Abstract = {{The negative effects of tilled fallow on soil quality may be reduced by
   utilizing legume green manure crops. A study was conducted to determine
   the suitability of biennial sweetclover {[}Melilotus officinalis (L.)
   Lam.] as a partial fallow replacement on the northern Great Plains.
   Sweetclover undersown in field pea (Pisum sativum L.), pax (Linum
   usitatissimum L.), or oriental mustard {[}Brassica juncea (L.) Coss.]
   and killed in June of the subsequent fallow year attained shoot biomass
   yields of 3110 to 5370 kg ha(-1), depending on the gear and companion
   crop with which it was grown. Living sweetclover plus its residues after
   being killed provided excellent ground cover to reduce the risk of
   erosion throughout the 20-mo fallow period. Sweetclover compared to
   tilled fallow reduced soil water content at the time of seeding spring
   wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 2 of 3 yr. Available soil N in April
   before seeding spring wheat was 16 to 56 kg ha(-1) greater in
   sweetclover green manure than in fallow treatments. Wheat yields were 47
   to 75\% greater in the sweetclover than in the fallow treatments.
   However, the many positive attributes of sweetclover green manure must
   be weighed against potential reductions in companion crop yield.
   Undersown sweetclover reduced pax yield in 1 of 3 yr and mustard and
   field pea yield in 2 of 3 yr, with yield losses ranging from 10 to 55\%.
   Additional research is needed to determine agronomic practices that
   would reduce competitive interactions between sweetclover and its
   companion crop.}},

Abstract = {{The amount and rate of soil N mineralization often influences the
   productivity and persistence of a grass-legume mixture. This research
   investigated soil N availability in monoculture and binary mixtures of
   alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) or red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) with
   eastern gamagrass {[}Tripsacum dactyloides (L.) L.] on sandy and clay
   loam soils near Manhattan, KS. Soil inorganic N and in situ net N
   mineralization were monitored monthly during the growing seasons of 1996
   and 1997, Soil inorganic N was two- to threefold higher with alfalfa,
   red clover, and gamagrass-alfalfa mixture than with gamagrass in
   monoculture at the end of 1996. At the midseason of 1997, soil inorganic
   N was three- to ninefold higher at the clay loam site, but at the sandy
   site, only alfalfa monoculture was three- to fivefold higher than the
   other treatments in both years. Soils under alfalfa at both sites in
   1997 had the highest cumulative net N mineralized (35-100 kg N ha(-1)
   yr(-1)), followed by the gamagrass-legume mixtures (15-62 kg N ha(-1)
   yr(-1)) and then the gamagrass monoculture treatment (2-15 kg N ha(-1)
   yr(-1) A high correlation (r(2) > 0.9, P < 0.05) was found between C/N
   ratio of the aboveground biomass and the total net N mineralized in the
   2nd yr for both sites, suggesting that litter quality is an important
   driving variable on N mineralization, Our results emphasize the
   importance of forage legumes in maintaining soil quality and
   productivity and quality of forage mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Recent interest in soil tillage and residue management has focused on
   low-input sustainable agriculture. This study was conducted to
   investigate the effect of three tillage systems (no-till, chisel plow,
   and moldboard plow) and four residue placements (bare, normal, mulch,
   and double mulch) on a most recently detected enzyme in soils,
   arylamidase activity. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of an
   N-terminal amino acid from peptides, amides, or arylamides. Results
   showed that arylamidase activity is greatly affected by tillage and crop
   residue placement. The greatest activity was found with chisel/mulch,
   moldboard plow/mulch, and no-till/double mulch, and the lowest with
   moldboard plow/normal and no-till/bare. Arylamidase activity was
   significantly correlated with organic C (r=0.59{*}{*}) and soil PHCaCl2
   (r=0.55{*}{*}), and decreased with soil depth. Results of this work
   suggest that the activity of this enzyme is affected by soil management,
   and indicate its potential ecological significance because of its role
   in the N cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Four higher plant species (Avena sativa L., oat; Lepidium sativum L.,
   cress; Brassica rapa Metzg., turnip; and Phaseolus vulgaris L., bush
   bean) and 15 soils including five mineral oil-contaminated soils were
   tested to assess a soil-based continuous seed germination and early
   seedling growth bioassay. Seed germination was recorded and the shoot
   biomass of 14-day seedlings measured. An automatic self-watering system
   was compared with the daily hand watering. Results obtained from this
   study show that the self-watering system had minor effects on both seed
   germination and early seedling growth, and that soil nutrient status
   rather than soil texture significantly affected both seedling emergence
   and shoot biomass. Proportional dilution of suspicious samples from
   primary tests with an appropriate control soil is recommended for
   secondary tests. Shoot biomass is a more sensitive measurement endpoint
   than seed germination. Bush bean should not be recommended for use due
   to its low sensitivity to mineral oil and poor germination in soil. (C)

Abstract = {{Reclaimed lignite open-cast mine areas in the Rhineland are covered by a
   mixture of loess and sand deposits containing organic material that
   originates from the upper quartary soil which has been taken from the
   front of the mining path. Consequently, the soil fauna that has
   established itself on the reclaimed open-cast mine areas may result from
   the primary succession and also from species that are carried to the
   dumping mines and are able to survive the dumping process. The reclaimed
   landscape consists of a regular structural pattern of crests and
   troughs. The troughs provide appropriate habitats for establishing a
   rich and diverse fauna with higher densities of almost all animal groups
   investigated, with enhanced microbial activity and higher values of
   available macronutrients. In terms of plant growth, the physical and
   chemical conditions found in the troughs exceeded the conditions found
   on the crests. From laboratory studies we made the following
   conclusions: (1) environmental conditions in the troughs were improved
   not only by erosion, but additionally by the soil fauna that directly
   enhanced microbial activity and indirectly increased the availability of
   macronutrients; (2) soil animals improved soil quality by increasing the
   pH-values, increasing the ammonium-nitrogen content and decreasing the
   contend of aluminium ions; and (3) a multiple-species system is able to
   improve soil quality more effectively than a single-species system. (C)

Abstract = {{An option-value model is developed to analyze the impacts of output
   price uncertainty, high sunk costs of adoption, and site-specific
   conditions on the optimal timing of adoption of two interrelated
   site-specific technologies, soil testing and variable rate technology
   (VRT). The model incorporates the potential for adopting these two
   technologies jointly or sequentially. The implications of the pattern of
   adoption for nitrogen pollution and for the design of a cost-share
   subsidy policy to accelerate the adoption of these technologies to
   reduce nitrogen pollution are also analyzed. Ignoring the potential for
   sequential adoption would tend to underpredict the adoption of soil
   testing and overpredict the adoption of VRT. Cost-share subsidies to
   induce accelerated adoption of VRT would be most effective at reducing
   nitrogen pollution if targeted toward fields with relatively high
   spatial variability in soil quality or soil fertility, and either low
   average soil quality or low average soil fertility.}},

Abstract = {{When contracts for the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) expire, highly
   erodible land that had a long-term vegetative cover composed of grasses
   or grass-legume mixtures may be converted back to cropland. Considering
   that some of the same leaf spot pathogens found on grasses can cause
   diseases on wheat, the management practices used to convert these lands
   were evaluated for their effect on winter wheat leaf spot diseases. In a
   3-year spring wheat-winter wheat-pea crop rotation, the major leaf spot
   diseases on winter wheat were tan spot and Stagonospora nodorum blotch.
   Removal of hay or leaving hay in the plots when converting grassland to
   cropland had no significant effect on leaf spot diseases, indicating
   that the residue from the grass-alfalfa crop did not influence leaf spot
   diseases on winter wheat. Tillage treatments did not influence the
   amount of disease in 1996, but with higher precipitation levels in 1999,
   higher disease severities were associated with the no tillage treatment.
   Higher levels of crop residue associated with the no tillage treatment
   could potentially carry over plant pathogens from one crop to the next.
   The severity of leaf spot diseases was consistently lower when nitrogen
   was applied, indicating the importance of nitrogen application when
   converting grassland to cropland.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the impact of no-tillage (NT) against
   conventional-tillage (CT), or the effect of different fertilizers and
   herbicides, soils recently incorporated to agriculture from the El
   Salado basin river (Buenos Aires, Argentina) under a corn
   (1996/1998)-pasture (1998-)rotation were monitored for several soil
   (micro)biological, physical and chemical properties during the second
   (1997) to fourth (1999) years from the beginning of the experiment
   (1996). The rates of exchange of O-2 and CO2 expressed in terms of kg
   O-2 or CO2-C per hectare per day, are denoted as qO(2) and qCO(2). They
   decreased at the end of the corn growth cycle (T2) along with an
   increase of the respiratory quotient (RQ = qCO(2)/qO(2)), when compared
   to the time of land preparation (TO), irrespective of the management
   system. Both, qO(2) and qCo(2), increased 8 months after the
   mixed-grass-legume pasture planting (T3) keeping similar RQs with values
   slightly higher for NT than CT. At T4 (after 20 months of pasture), a 22
   and 21\% decrease of organic carbon was registered for NT and CT,
   respectively, with respect to the beginning of the experiment. A 22\%
   (not significative) and a significative 31\% diminish of total nitrogen
   was observed in the NT and CT systems, respectively. The results
   obtained are discussed in terms of soil function and sustainability in
   both management systems tested. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Measuring soil quality is extremely difficult, yet it has clear economic
   importance. In particular, there is a great deal of empirical interest
   in the dynamics of soil quality evolution when land managers respond to
   policies and other incentives. Yet current methodologies for measuring
   changes in agricultural land quality are largely static and rely heavily
   either on incomplete measures such as proxy variables, or ad hoc indexes
   of selected soil characteristics. Moreover, much empirical work relies
   on static econometric techniques or simulation models. In this paper, we
   develop a means to infer soil quality changes from input and output data
   using a dynamic production function model. Using data from field
   experiments, we estimate the model in a way that allows the recovery of
   a dynamic measure of soil quality whose evolution depends on variations
   in management practices. Our methodology and findings will help provide
   firmer empirical foundations for analyses of the economic implications
   of land degradation and the soil quality implications of agricultural
   policies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the Lemnitz forest district as well as in other forest districts of
   the Thuringian and Saxonian Vogtland county, so-called Green Eyes were
   installed around 1938. These are small-sized plantations of beech (Fagus
   sylvatica L.) within large complexes of conifer stands. In the presented
   paper the influence of beech on soil and the growth of beech were
   investigated in comparison with neighbouring even-aged spruce stands
   (Picea abies {[}L.] KARST) 60 years after planting. For this purpose, 10
   pairs of investigation plots were selected in which soil profiles were
   ditched, samples of the humus layer and the mineral soil were taken, and
   root density and the diversity of Lumbricidae were investigated.
   Further, the growth of the stands was recorded.
   In all investigation plots a homogenous soil substrate was found: a
   stony, gravelly, silty loam originated from carboneous schists and
   sandstones mixed with loess. A brown earth-pseudogley-soil association
   has developed. The soil density is looser under beech than under spruce.
   The beech humus layer had a higher pH, a closer UN ratio and a better
   supply of calcium and magnesium. On the other hand, in the mineral soil
   no significant chemical differences between the two tree species were
   found except for a higher pH value under beech.
   Beech roots were found to be deeper and denser in the soil volume
   between trunks than spruce (beech: 0.9m deep, 5 fine roots/dm(2) roots
   on average from 0 to 40 cm depth; spruce: 0.7 m deep, 1.5 fine
   roots/dm(2)).
   Species and individuals of Lumbricidae are more numerous under beech
   than under spruce. The beech stands were 59, the spruce stands 48 years
   old. Beech reached a height growth bonity of 28 m (II, 0), spruce, 31 m
   (I, 8).
   The installation of long-term trial plots and expansion to other regions
   are recommended for further installation.}},

Abstract = {{An overview is given on the development, properties, and application of
   the European reference soil set the EUROSOILS. The introduction of this
   new type of reference material has, for the first time, enabled
   comparison of data related to the interaction of chemical substances
   with the soil, and thus, improvement of soil quality. Because of their
   unforeseen success, a second generation of EUROSOILS had been produced
   and the range of application extended to other types of measurement
   related to the soil matrix - soil pH, carbon and nitrogen content,
   particle-size distribution and cation-exchange capacity. Other fields of
   application include analytical method development or testing of soil
   decontamination techniques.
   On the basis of the success of the EUROSOIL concept and the need for a
   common basis for comparison of soil-related data in Europe and beyond,
   the European Commission's Institute for Reference Materials and
   Measurements decided to certify several properties of the second
   EUROSOIL-generation, thus establishing a common QA/QC system for
   soil-related data. The main features of the EUROSOILS, their origin, the
   necessary field and laboratory work, and some interesting background
   information about the project are presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of NPK fertilization on water and bottom soil properties and
   on the biological productivity of culture ponds was investigated. The
   monthly nitrate and phosphate concentrations in fertilized ponds were
   higher than that in control ponds to which no fertilizer was added,
   illustrating a rapid utilization of these nutrients by growing
   phytoplankton. There was a significant relationship between average
   chlorophyll-a concentration and phytoplankton abundance through NPK
   treatments. The regression results showed significant interaction
   between transparency and dry weight of planktonic biomass and the same
   was observed between organic carbon and benthic biomass. The
   coefficients of determination (R-2) of planktonic biomass on water
   physicochemical factors showed 35.66 and 64.34\% contribution in control
   and treated ponds respectively. The overall contribution of soil
   physicochemical factors to benthic biomass was 35.14\% in control ponds
   and 64.88\% in treated ponds. Water temperature significantly affected
   transparency through planktonic biomass. Organic carbon had simple
   correlation with pH, phosphorus and calcium and inverse but direct
   correlation with total nitrogen. It strongly affected the benthic
   biomass in fertilized ponds. Based on the dynamic interactions among
   nutrient concentration, planktonic biomass and benthic biomass, it is
   suggested that rate of inorganic nutrients addition may influence the
   biological production-potentiality of fish pond waters through the
   indirect contribution of temperature and transparency.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last 2 decades, policy-makers have been giving increasing
   attention to the remediation and redevelopment of contaminated sites,
   especially those located in urban areas commonly referred to as
   brownfields. Traditionally, private developers have tended to ignore
   these sites on account of a series of obstacles of a
   structural-political nature, including variability in regulatory
   processes, lack of information on soil quality, impractical clean up
   standards, fear of liability, and limited funding resources for clean
   ups. This paper examines the types of policy-making measures that are
   currently being taken in Canada to overcome these obstacles, comparing
   them to those being taken in the US and Europe. If is argued that the
   contaminated site-related policies and programs employed to overcome
   each obstacle, both within Canada and internationally, are converging in
   style and content as governments are becoming more aware of the types of
   costs and risks they must share in order to solve the problem
   effectively. It is also argued that this trend is unfolding in a
   relatively predictable way, and that policy-making in Canada is evolving
   more slowly than if is in the other jurisdictions examined. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems project (SAFS) was
   established in 1988 to study the transition from conventional to
   low-input and organic crop production practices. The project includes
   four-year crop rotations under conventional (conv-4), low-input, and
   organic management and a conventionally managed, two-year rotation
   (conv-2). Positive effects on soil quality resulting from low-input and
   organic management include increased soil organic matter, a reduction in
   soil-borne diseases, increased pools of P and K, higher microbial
   biomass and activity, an increase in mobile humic acids and increased
   water infiltration rates and soil water-holding capacity. Pesticide use
   in the low-input cropping system is about 25\% of that used in the
   conventional systems. The most profitable farming system continues to be
   the conv-2 system due to the greater frequency of tomato in that
   rotation. Among the four-year rotations, the organic system, in which
   the produce commands premium prices, is the most profitable, although
   least profitable if premium prices are not applied. Information
   generated from SAFS research has been disseminated via videotape,
   workshops, annual field days, field tours, educational materials,
   peer-reviewed articles and an Internet homepage. Future challenges for
   the SAFS project include development of reduced-tillage and cover crop
   management strategies to optimize N availability following cash crops;
   weed management in organic and low-input systems, improvement of
   water-use efficiency in alternative systems and sequestration of C in
   the soil.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in soil quality after 45 years of continuous production of corn
   (Zea mays L.) by the conventional tillage method (C) compared with
   adjacent poplar forest (F) and native grassland (G) sites were examined.
   The investigated parameters were: total and humified organic C, total N,
   light fraction content and composition, water-soluble organic C (WSOC),
   water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), phenolic substances, biomass C,
   cumulative CO(2)-C (soil respiration) (C(m)), enzyme activities
   (alkaline phosphatase, protease, beta -glucosidase, urease, catalase and
   dehydrogenase). Empirical indexes of soil quality were also calculated:
   biomass C/organic C, specific respiration of biomass C (qCO(2)), death
   rate quotient (qD), metabolic potential (MP), biological index of
   fertility (BIF), enzyme activity number (EAN) and hydrolysing
   coefficient (HC). Results indicate that long-term corn production at an
   intensive level caused a marked decline in all examined parameters.
   Between the undisturbed systems, native grassland showed higher values
   of soil quality parameters than forest site. The indexes most responsive
   to management practices that may provide indications of the effects of
   soil cultivation, as well as of the differently undisturbed ecosystems
   were: organic C, WSC, C(m), protease, beta -glucosidase, urease and HC.
   Soil enzyme activities were well related with, and not more sensitive
   than organic carbon.}},

Pages = {{953-964}},

Abstract = {{Soil microbial and nematode populations, soil microbial community
   structure, and microbial and nematode functional diversity were studied
   in two fertiliser Trials on perennial pasture at three sampling times.
   The N trial involved the application of 0, 200 and 400 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)
   in the form of urea. The P trial involved the application of 0, 30, 50
   and 100 kg P ha(-1) y(-1) as superphosphate. The purpose of this study
   was to determine biological characteristics that may be used as
   indicators of soil quality as affected by fertiliser inputs.
   The N or P treatments had no effect on total bacteria, cellulolytic
   microbes, or the fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis. The fungus Fusarium
   culmorum was found only in the 200 kg N treatment (P < 0.01).
   Gliocladium roseum declined in isolation frequency with increasing N (P
   < 0.05,) while other Gliocladium spp. increased (P < 0.01).
   The microbial community structure, ecophysiological index (EP), and
   colony-development index (CD) were determined using: colony development
   rates in 1/10 tryptose soy agar (TSA), a Pseudomonas medium, and a
   nutrient poor medium. These parameters were not affected by the addition
   of the N or P fertilisers. In the N trial, the functional diversity of
   soil microbes, as determined by Shannon Diversity Index (H) and average
   well colour development (AWCD) (using Biolog gram negative microplates)
   was higher in the unfertilised than fertilised treatments. The values
   for H and AWCD were 4.2 and 0.78 in the unfertilised compared to 4.0 and
   0.53 in fertilised treatment (P < 0.01. 48 h, mean for both N
   treatments), respectively. There were no significant differences in
   these values in the P trial.
   Populations of the plant feeding nematodes Pratylenchus and
   Paratylenchus were greater (P < 0.05) whereas those of Meloidogyne were
   lower (P < 0.001), in soils fertilsed with N than in unfertilised soils.
   The genera Aporcelaimus, Dorylaimellus, and Tylencholaimellus were found
   only in control plots and their loss paralleled faunal changes resulting
   from pasture improvement reported elsewhere. Nematode Maturity Index
   (MI) values were 1.78, 1.85, and 1.53 for the N fertiliser treatments (P
   < 0.05) suggesting a reduction at 400 kg N. The MI was not affected by
   the application of P (mean, 2.01), however, but all values in the P
   trial were greater than in the N trial. In the N and P trials an average
   of 29 and 35 nematode taxa were discriminated. The ratio of
   bacterial-feeding nematodes to bacterial-feeding plus fungal-feeding
   nematodes was similar across all treatments of the N (0.90-0.92) and P
   (0.83-0.90) trials, suggesting no relative change in the importance of
   bacterial- and fungal-mediated decomposition pathways in these soils as
   a result of fertiliser application.
   The finding that most microbiological characteristics did not respond to
   many years of fertiliser treatments suggests that the microbial
   community in the soils are similar and fertiliser amendments are
   insufficient to induce changes (either direct or indirect due to plant
   effects) in these communities. However, the consistent decrease in
   functional diversity of soil microflora and nematode populations with
   the application N, but not P. indicates that the N application can

Abstract = {{Soil microbiological analyses may serve as a means for assessing soil
   characteristics. Standard microbiological culture-techniques, however,
   leave over 90\% of the microorganisms in the environment unaccounted
   for. Several more recently developed analytical techniques such as DNA,
   phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), and community level substrate
   utilization (CLSU) fingerprints allow for more detailed analyses of soil
   microbial communities. We applied analyses of(l) community DNA with PCR
   and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), (2) community PLFAs
   with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, and (3) CLSU with Biolog
   (TM) gram-negative-plates. to evaluate the biological characteristics of
   three soils used in pesticide degradation studies. Each of these methods
   analyzes a different aspect of soil microbial characteristics. A
   protocol was developed for the statistical comparison and combination of
   the data from all the analyses, thus allowing for a polyphasic approach
   to biological soil characterization. We found that all three methods
   yielded highly reproducible results for each soil and allowed to
   distinguish the soils based on the structures of specific gene- and
   PLFA-pools as well as on CLSU fingerprints. Not all methods, however,
   revealed the same relative similarities of the three soils based on
   cluster analysis of the biological characteristics. These results
   demonstrate the value of comparative data analyses and indicate that
   biological soil characterization needs to be interpreted with caution if
   it is performed with one method only. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Biological and chemical components of soil fertility were quantified
   under three different fallow types and related to soil quality of an
   Ultisol in southern Cameroon at the end of a 9-month fallow. Soil
   organic matter (SOM). soil exchangeable Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+ and available
   P concentrations, effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) and, soil
   acidity in the 0-10 and 10-20 cm layers were evaluated under: natural
   regrowth mainly composed of Chromolaena odorata and the legume cover
   crops velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens var. utilis) and kudzu (Pueraria
   phaseoloides). SOM quality was assessed by C mineralisation during a
   4-week incubation at 28 degreesC in the laboratory. In addition,
   particulate organic matter (POM), the most active part of SOM. was
   fractionated by wet sieving into coarse (4000-2000 mum). medium
   (2000-250 mum) and fine (250-53 mum) particle size classes and analysed
   for C and N contents. Under Mucuna, Ca2+,, K+ and P concentrations, ECEC
   and soil pH were higher and C mineralisation was Lower than under
   natural regrowth and Pueruria in 0-10 cm depth. Soil under natural
   regrowth had a higher C mineralisation in 0-10 cm indicating more labile
   SOM than in Pueraria and Mucuna fallow. There was no difference in
   weight of total POM. for any of the fractions between the three fallow
   types. However. both leguminous fallow species increased POM quality
   through a higher N content. Compared to natural regrowth, Pueraria
   increased N content in coarse POM by 36\% in the 0-10 cm layer and by
   19\% (coarse POM) and 35\% (medium POM) in the 10-20 cm layer. Mucuna
   increased N content in the 0-10 cm layer by 12\% (coarse POM), and by
   19\% (fine: POM), compared to natural regrowth. According to the
   differences in nutrient concentrations, soil acidity and the biological
   stability of SOM, the three fallow types tanked: Mucuna greater than or
   equal to Pueraria > natural regrowth. However. in terms of POM quality
   the ranking was: Pueraria > Mucuna natural regrowth. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Ridge tillage is a special conservation tillage method, but the
   long-term effect of this tillage system on crop yield and soil quality
   in a corn (Zea mays L,) and soybean {[}Glycine mm (L.) Merr.] rotation
   is largely unknown in the northern Corn Belt of the USA. Our objectives
   were to compare crop performance and soil condition at three
   nitrogen-fertilizer levels under ridge tillage (RT) and conventional
   tillage (CT). The experiment was started in 1990 at Brookings, SD, on a
   Barnes clay loam (US soil taxonomy: fine-loamy, mixed Udic Haploboroll;
   FAO classification: Chernozem). CT included moldboard or chisel plowing,
   seedbed preparation with tandem disk and field cultivator, and raw
   cultivation. Raised beds under RT were maintained using only row
   cultivation. Corn grain yield was significantly (p less than or equal to
   0.10) greater on CT than on RT. Average (11 years and three fertilizer-N
   rates) corn yield was 6267 kg ha(-1) with RT and 6500 kg ha(-1) with CT.
   Soybean grain yield was not significantly (p less than or equal to 0.10)
   different between RT and CT. Average (11 years and three fertilizer-N
   rates) soybean yield was 1997 kg ha(-1) with RT and 2058 kg ha(-1) with
   CT. In 9 of 11 years there was a significant soybean-yield response to
   N-starter fertilizer. There was no significant accumulation of NO3-N in
   the top 3 m of soil at the end of 9 years in either tillage treatment
   (111 kg NO3-N ha(-1) under RT and 121 kg NO3-N ha(-1) under CT). Soil pH
   in the top 15 cm was unaffected by tillage (average pH was 6.62). In
   1999, soil organic C in the top 0.2 m was significantly greater under CT
   (56 Mg ha(-1)) than under RT (52 Mg ha(-1)). Bulk density in the top 0.2
   m was significantly greater under RT (1.52 g cm(-3)) than under CT (1.44
   gr cm(-3)). Tillage did not have a great effect on grain yield or soil
   properties. RT can protect soil from erosion because crop residues
   remain relatively undisturbed on the soil surface in contrast to chisel
   plow. In this respect, we expect RT to be more sustainable over the long
   term than chisel plow tillage. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Soil aggregate stability is widely recognized as a key indicator of soil
   quality and rangeland health. However, few standard methods exist for
   quantifying soil stability in the field. A stability kit is described
   which can be inexpensively and easily assembled with minimal tools. It
   permits up to Is samples to be evaluated in less than 10 min and
   eliminates the need for transportation, minimizing damage to soil
   structure. The kit consists of two 21 x 10.5 x 3.5 cm plastic boxes
   divided into eighteen 3.5 X 3.5 cm sections, eighteen 2.5-cm diameter
   sieves with 1.5-mm distance openings and a small spatula used for soil
   sampling. Soil samples are rated on a scale from one to six based on a
   combination of ocular observations of slaking during the first 5 min
   following immersion in distilled water, and the percent remaining on a
   1.5-mm sieve after five dipping cycles at the end of the 5-min period. A
   laboratory comparison yielded a correlation between the stability class
   and percent aggregate stability based on oven dry weight remaining after
   treatment using a mechanical sieve. We have applied the method in a wide
   variety of agricultural and natural ecosystems throughout western North
   America, including northern Mexico, and have found that it is highly
   sensitive to differences in management and plant community composition.
   Although the field kit cannot replace the careful laboratory-based
   measurements of soil aggregate stability, it can clearly provide
   valuable information when these more intensive procedures are not
   possible. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B,V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregate stability affects soil strength and, therefore, the soil's
   ability to transmit liquids and gases, which are important functions for
   crop production and ecosystem health. Because aggregate stability is an
   indicator of vital soil functions, it can be used to assess soil
   quality. For soil quality assessments, there is a need for a
   quantitative field method for measuring aggregate stability that simple
   to perform, low cost, and available for routine assessments by land
   managers. A method is presented that follows the commonly used or
   standard single-sieve wet-sieving method for aggregate stability. A
   combination of manual sieving and drying apparatus is constructed from a
   trunk-style tackle box. Sieves are constructed from a 60-mesh screen and
   PVC reducing adapters. The method requires manual sieving, 30 cycles per
   minute (0.5 cycles/s) for 3 min. Percent water aggregate stabilities
   from the proposed manual sieving technique were not significantly
   different from aggregate stabilities obtained from the mechanical wet
   sieving technique. The proposed low cost method was able to distinguish
   differences in aggregate stability caused by differences in soil type
   and land use. This low cost method provides a tool that can be used in
   conjunction with other measurements to assess relative differences in
   soil quality. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has suggested that
   large-scale use of carbon-neutral or low-carbon biomass-derived energy
   will be essential in order to limit carbon emissions from the world's
   energy sector in the future. The IPCC envisions as much as 400 million
   ha being devoted to biomass energy plantations by 2050. To realize
   production of biomass energy at such levels - in a manner that would be
   both biogeophysically sustainable and socially beneficial - will require
   planning and policy development at sub-national levels, taking into
   account biogeophysical, social, cultural, economic, institutional, and
   other factors. This paper presents a method for spatially explicit
   calculations for estimating potential biomass yields over relatively
   large geographic regions. The calculations use geo-referenced data
   inputs that include rainfall, insolation, temperature, soil quality, and
   soil depth. The methodology is applied to the Northeast region of
   Brazil, which accounts for 10\% of the area of South America. Northeast
   Brazil is an interesting site for illustrative purposes in part because
   it is biologically, geologically, and socio-economically diverse and in
   part because the main electric utility serving the region is exploring
   the development of biomass-based electricity generation to meet future
   increases in electricity demand. Results from a spatially explicit,
   biogeophysical model like that presented here could be combined with
   other spatially explicit information such as road layouts, existing land
   uses, population densities and growth rates, distributions of endangered
   species, archeologically significant areas, etc. to inform planning and
   policy development related to biomass energy at a regional or national
   level. One illustration of such an analysis is included here. For
   on-the-ground implementation of biomass production systems,
   finer-resolution analysis and intimate local participation is essential.

Abstract = {{Lack of adequate nutrient supply and poor soil structure are the
   principal constraints to crop production under low input agriculture
   systems of West Africa. Experiments at two sites (Mediga and Yimtenga)
   were conducted in Burkina Faso to assess the impact of compost on
   improving crop production and soil properties. In the first experiment,
   compost was applied at the rate of 0 and 10 MS ha(-1) in Mediga on a
   Ferric Lixisol, and 5 and 0 Mg ha(-1) on a Ferric-gleyic Lixisol in
   Yimtenga. A second experiment was conducted in Yimtenga to assess the
   role of compost in mitigating the effect of delay in sowing on crop
   performance. 0 and 5 Mg ha(-1) compost plots were sown within the normal
   period for sowing sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) and with a delay
   of 1 month. A randomised block design was used with four replications
   for the two experiments.
   Semi-structured interviews were used to study socio-economic issues of
   compost technology. No significant difference in soil organic matter
   content was found between treatments receiving compost and no-compost.
   However; compost application increased soil cation exchange capacity
   (CEC) from 4 to 6 cmol kg(-1). Soil pH was also increased by the compost
   application. Sorghum yield tripled on the 10 Mg ha(-1) compost plots and
   increased by 45\% on the 5 Mg ha(-1) compost plots, compared to
   no-compost plots. Compost application mitigated the negative effects of
   a delay in sowing. The study showed that farmers were aware of the role
   of compost in sustaining yield and improving soil quality. However, lack
   of equipment and adequate organic material for making compost, land
   tenure and the intensive labour required for making compost are major
   constraints for the adoption of compost technology. It was concluded
   that compost application could contribute to increase food availability
   in the Sahel and therefore, efforts should be made to alleviate the
   socio-economic constraints to the adoption of compost technology. (C)

Abstract = {{Nitrate losses through subsurface drains in agricultural fields pose a
   serious threat to surface water quality, Substantial reductions in
   drainage losses of NO3-N can occur with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) or
   perennial grasses as used in Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)
   plantings. Conversion of perennials to annual row crops, however, could
   have rapid, adverse affects on water quality. We evaluated water and N
   use efficiency of row crops following perennials, and losses of water
   and NO3-N to subsurface drains, Four cropping systems: continuous corn
   (Zea mays L.), a corn-soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation,
   alfalfa (ALF), and CRP, were established in 1988. The ALF and CRP were
   converted to a corn-corn-soybean sequence from 1994 through 1996 while
   continuous corn (C-C) and corn-soybean (C-S) rotations were maintained.
   Following CRP, corn yield was 14\% and water use efficiency (WUE) 20\%
   greater as compared with C-C. Yield was 19\% and WUE 21\% greater for
   soybean following corn in CRP and ALF as compared with C-S. Residual
   soil NO3-N (RSN) increased 125\% in first year corn following CRP and
   was 32\% greater than C-C by 1996. High N uptake efficiencies of corn
   following alfalfa slowed the buildup of RSN, but levels were equal to
   row crop systems after 2 Sr. Nitrate losses in drainage water remained
   low during the initial year of conversion, but were similar to row crop
   systems during the subsequent 2 Sr, Beneficial effects of perennials on
   subsurface drainage characteristics were largely negated following 1 to
   2 yr of corn.}},

Abstract = {{Ridgetops in the dryland fanning region of eastern Washington suffer
   from low productivity and poor soil quality from years of erosion. Two
   studies investigated the effectiveness of soil amendments in restoring
   soil quality. Study 1 treatments were two rates of compost and a
   control. Study 2 treatments were compost, coal ash, wheat straw, three
   rates of inorganic N, and a control. A wide array of soil biological,
   chemical and physical parameters were measured from 1995 to 1997 and
   yield of spring barley, spring pea, and winter wheat were measured in
   different years from 1995 though 1998. In study 1, compost plus N
   increased barley yield and soil pH. Compost without N in study 2
   increased total soil C and continued to immobilize soil N 2 years af ter
   incorporation because of the high C:N ratio of the compost. Total soil
   N, available P and K, some micronutrients, and cation exchange capacity
   were increased by the compost. Compost reduced soil bulk density and
   soil impedance, while increasing water-stable aggregates and improving
   infiltration. Coal ash slightly suppressed phosphatase activity, while
   tending to increase pH and soil B, and improving infiltration. Straw
   decreased soil bulk density and microbial activity in 1996 only. Barley
   grain trace element uptake, barley yield, and pea yield were
   uninfluenced by amendments. In 1998, 3 years after application of the
   amendments, winter wheat yield was significantly higher from the compost
   application than from any other treatments. Compost had the greatest
   benefit to improving soil quality and crop yield.}},

Abstract = {{A crop rotation experiment initiated in 1958 on a thin Black Chernozemic
   clay at Indian Head, Saskatchewan, was managed using conventional
   tillage until 1989 and changed to zero-tillage in 1990. We soil sampled
   in 1987 and 1997 to determine management effects on selected soil
   biochemical characteristics, and the change in some of the more labile
   soil quality attributes relative to the change in soil organic C and
   total N. Rotations examined were: fallow-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
   (F-W), fallow-wheat-wheat (F-W-W), continuous wheat (Cont W), legume
   green manure (GM)-W-W, and F-W-W-hay (legume-grass)-hay-hay
   (F-W-W-HH-H). The monoculture cereal rotations were either fertilized
   with N and P based on soil tests or unfertilized, while the
   legume-containing systems were unfertilized. There was also a F-W-W ON +
   P) treatment, in which about 20\% of the straw was harvested each crop
   year. With the change to zero-tillage management in 1990 and in
   anticipation of greater soil water storage, higher rates of N were added
   thereafter. This resulted in an upward trend in stubble-crop yields and
   a positive yield response of wheat grown on fallow, where before the
   change wheat grown on fallow did not respond to fertilizer. The
   corresponding increase in crop residue production and residue C inputs
   resulted in all fertilized systems gaining organic C and total N in the
   0- to 15-cm depth between 1987 and 1997, while the unfertilized systems
   remained unchanged. Soil organic C and total N, microbial biomass C
   (MBC), light fraction organic C and N (LFC and LFN), mineralizable N
   (N-min) and wet aggregate stability (WAS), generally had positive
   responses to fertilization, to increased cropping frequency, and to the
   inclusion of legume green manure or legume hay crops in cereal-based
   rotations. Straw harvesting did not influence grain yields, nor did it
   influence the soil biochemical characteristics, though it tended to
   render the soil more prone to erosion. Response to cropping frequency
   was apparent only in the fertilized systems, where the more labile soil
   quality attributes, (i.e., MBC, LFC, LFN, and N-min) were more sensitive
   than organic C or total N. However, gains in LFC and MBC in response to
   fertilizer did not account for a significant fraction of the gain in
   total organic C. During the period 1987 to 1997, MBC in the 0- to 15-cm
   depth increased by 40\% in absolute value and by 33\% relative to
   organic C (3.6\% of organic C in 1997 vs. 2.7\% in 1987). The same was
   true for LFN in the fertilized treatments and in the green manured
   system (1.46\% of total N in 1997 vs. 1.15\% in 1987). However, LFC
   hardly changed over this period. Relative to total N, N-min decreased in
   1997 compared with 1987, likely due to higher immobilization. Wet
   aggregate stability was generally greater in 1997 compared with 1991,
   reflecting greater crop residue inputs and less soil disturbance under
   zero-tillage management.}},

   Millennium has brought other challenges and new opportunities. Rapidly
   increasing population in countries that can least afford it have made
   them food-insecure. With inadequate inputs in agriculture, developing
   countries are degrading their lands rapidly and destroying ecosystems.
   Affluence in the richer countries has precipitated other problems
   hampering ecosystem functions and quality of land resources. These
   changing conditions have placed new demands on both the society and the
   soil science community. The latter has resulted in new areas of soil
   sub-disciplines such as land and soil quality, land degradation and
   desertification, cycling of bio-geochemicals, soil pollution assessment
   and monitoring etc. Advances in information technology have also enabled
   the science to meet the new demands of the enviro-centric world. In the
   last decade, noticeable changes are evident in methods and research
   priorities in the discipline. Soil resource assessment and monitoring is
   entering a new era, in terms of quality of information produced by new
   information technologies through the innovative use of Geographic
   Information Systems and remote sensing and significantly improving the
   acceptance and use of soil survey information. Electronic technology has
   dramatically increased the demand for and ability to process more data.
   Other innovations have resulted in quantitative approaches in soil
   genetic studies and demonstrated the integral role of soils in
   ecosystems. For global and regional resource assessment, concepts and
   procedures were refined. The World Reference Base for soil
   classification and the Global Soil and Terrain Database are the first
   steps towards standardisation and a more detailed assessment of global
   soils. The global assessment of human-induced land degradation and
   vulnerability to desertification are benchmark products of the
   databases. Environmental pollution and its effects on human and
   ecosystem health have become public concerns and soil science has
   contributed to localising, quantifying, and developing mitigation
   technologies to address the problems. The challenges of climate change
   and the charge to maintain ecologcal integrity have been met with
   technologies such as conservation tillage, agroforestry, precision
   agriculture etc. New concepts such as multi-functionality of land, soil
   quality, sustainability of agriculture and carbon sequestration, have
   emerged leading to new management strategies and an enhanced quality of
   life. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The agricultural sustainability of small-holder agriculture in semi-arid
   northern Nigeria was assessed. Topsoil (0-30 cm) samples from cultivated
   and uncultivated soils were analysed for texture, pH, exchangeable
   cations, cation exchange capacity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and
   total and available potassium and phosphorus. Comparison of data from
   cultivated and uncultivated soils revealed that cultivation led to
   losses of fine soil particles, organic carbon and total nitrogen as well
   as a reduction in cation exchange capacity and available water-holding
   capacity. The level of soil clay was shown to have the greatest
   influence on agricultural sustainability. It is recommended that soil
   conservation, especially the reduction of soil loss by erosion, should
   be emphasized in order to enhance agricultural sustainability. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Effects on soil quality and crop establishment after incorporation of
   flue gas desulfurization by-product (FGD) into soil as an amendment was
   assessed in a mesocosm study. Mesocosm units received applications
   equivalent to 0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10\% FGD residue {[}0, 25, 50, 75,
   and 100 tons acre(-1)]. Germination, biomass production, and elemental
   composition of corn (Zea mays L. var. Dekalb DK683), soybean {[}Glycine
   max (L.) Merr. var. Haskell Pupa 94], radish (Raphanus sativus L. var.
   Sparkler), and cotton (Gossypius hirsutus L. var. Deltapine 51) were
   determined. The quality of leachates and soil were also determined
   periodically. Flue gas desulfurization residue did not affect
   germination and all application rates stimulated aboveground biomass.
   Plants grown in FGD-amended soil contained significantly elevated tissue
   concentrations of As, B, Se, and Rile. The FGD residue elevated surface
   soil pH from 55 (Control) to 8.1 (at 10\% FGD). Leachate pH was
   unaffected by FGD, but salinity rose sharply with increasing application
   rates of FGD. Leachates contained higher concentrations of B, with small
   increases in Se and As. Flue gas desulfurization residue application
   caused an increase in total B, As, Mo, Se, and extractable Ca in the
   soil, but decreased Mn and Zn. Using FGD residues could have beneficial
   effects on crop establishment without detrimental effects on soil or
   leachate quality, at an optimum rate of approximately 2.5\%. This
   material could alleviate surface acidity, and B and Mo deficiencies in
   plants.}},

Abstract = {{Soil textural analysis is a key component of any minimum data set used
   for assessing soil quality and sustainability of agricultural-management
   practices, However, conventional methods of soil textural analysis can
   be costly and time-consuming. The objective of this study was to develop
   a rapid and simple method for evaluating soil particle-size
   distribution, which could be employed as a tool For initial soil-quality
   assessment. The method uses a combination of sieving and sedimentation
   steps and is designed to be used in conjunction with analysis of
   particulate organic matter (POM), or as a stand-alone textural analysis.
   Soils of varied texture and organic-matter content were collected from
   six sites in the Great Plains, Their sand, silt, and clay contents were
   determined using the proposed methods and standard hydrometer and
   pipette techniques. Averaged across all soils, absolute differences
   between the proposed and standard pipette analyses were <2\% for sand,
   silt, and clay. Relative differences were 6, -1, and -4\% for sand,
   silt, and clay, respectively. Coefficients of variation within soil
   samples averaged <5\% for sand, silt, and clay fractions. Regression
   analysis between proposed and standard pipette methods produced
   coefficient of determination (r(2)) values of 0.99, 0.98, and 0.93 for
   sand, silt, and clay, respectively, and 0.98 across all particle-size
   ranges, The method provides an inexpensive and reliable estimate of soil
   texture, useful in soil-quality assessment.}},

   wheat crop were 75 to 97\% lower in yellow sweetclover than in untreated
   fallow treatments. Yellow sweetclover controlled the perennial weeds
   dandelion and perennial sowthistle, as well as the annuals kochia,
   flixweed, Russian thistle, and downy brome. Weed suppression was similar
   whether yellow sweetclover was harvested as hay or its residues were
   incorporated or left on the soil surface, suggesting that a portion of
   the weed suppression effect may be due to allelopathic compounds being
   released from decomposing yellow sweetclover. Results will be used to
   develop more sustainable agronomic practices in regions where fallow is
   still widely employed.}},

Abstract = {{Target loads for acid deposition in the Netherlands, as formulated in
   the Dutch environmental policy plan, are based on critical load
   calculations at the end of the 1980s. Since then knowledge on the effect
   of acid deposition on terrestrial ecosystems has substantially
   increased. In the early 1990s a simple mass balance model was developed
   to calculate critical loads. This model was evaluated and the methods
   were adapted to represent the current knowledge. The main changes in the
   model are the use of actual empirical relationships between Al and H
   concentrations in the soil solution, the addition of a constant base
   saturation as a second criterion for soil quality and the use of tree
   species-dependant critical Al/base cation (BC) ratios for Dutch
   circumstances. The changes in the model parameterisation and in the
   Al/BC criteria led to considerably (50\%) higher critical loads for root
   damage. The addition of a second criterion in the critical load
   calculations for soil quality caused a decrease in the critical loads
   for soils with a median to high base saturation such as loess and clay
   soils. The adaptation hardly effected the median critical load for soil
   quality in the Netherlands, since only 15\% of the Dutch forests occur
   on these soils. On a regional scale, however, critical loads were (much)
   lower in areas where those soils are located. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The spreading of sewage sludge on acidic ferralsol soil was simulated in
   a column experiment in order to estimate the potential impact on water
   and soil quality. Drainage and runoff water were sampled daily over a
   2-month experiment and analysed for Fe, Ni, Cu, Pb and DOG. Results show
   a clear influence of the sludge on the water quality, especially at the
   start of the experiment, increasing the export of Cu, Ni, Ph and in DOC
   from the soil, mainly in dissolved form. Nickel was usually the most
   mobile element in the sludge and in the soil. In the soil, Pb mobility
   was complex and increased drastically with time compared to the other
   elements. No significant increase in soil heavy metal content due to the
   sludge spreading was recorded on this time scale. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Escalating production costs, heavy reliance on non-renewable resources,
   reduced biodiversity, water contamination, chemical residues in food,
   soil degradation and health risks to farmworkers handling pesticides all
   bring into question the sustainability of conventional farming
   systems(1-4). It has been claimed(5,6), however, that organic farming
   systems are less efficient, pose greater health risks and produce half
   the yields of conventional farming systems. Nevertheless, organic
   farming became one of the fastest growing segments of US and European
   agriculture during the 1990s(7,8). Integrated farming, using a
   combination of organic and conventional techniques, has been
   successfully adopted on a wide scale in Europe(9). Here we report the
   sustainability of organic, conventional and integrated apple production
   systems in Washington State from 1994 to 1999. All three systems gave
   similar apple yields. The organic and integrated systems had higher soil
   quality and potentially lower negative environmental impact than the
   conventional system. When compared with the conventional and integrated
   systems, the organic system produced sweeter and less tart apples,
   higher profitability and greater energy efficiency. Our data indicate
   that the organic system ranked first in environmental and economic
   sustainability, the integrated system second and the conventional system
   last.}},

Abstract = {{Kuttanad, the low-lying tract in Kerala State of south-west India, is a
   place where drainage problems have caused the agricultural production to
   remain low. The problem is more severe in the acid sulphate soils of
   Kuttanad. Besides the problems inherent to acid sulphate soils, the area
   also experiences problems of flooding, lack of fresh water and intrusion
   of saline water from the Arabian Sea. A subsurface drainage system
   consisting of 10 cm diameter clay tiles, each of 60 cm length, was
   installed at a depth of 1 m with two different spacings of 15 and 30 m
   for evaluating its influence in improving soil quality and crop
   production. Many of the critical crop growth parameters in the
   subsurface drained area, particularly the grain yield and 100 grain
   weight, were significantly superior to that of the ill-drained areas.
   Drain spacings up to 30 m was found to significantly improve the
   productivity of the area. The overall increase in rice yield due to
   subsurface drainage was 1.36 t/ha. It was also found that subsurface
   drainage could remove the chemical heterogeneity of soil which is the
   root cause for patchy crop growth and uneven ripening of rice crop in
   the area. Acidity in the subsurface drained area was always lower
   throughout the cropping season. The salinity in the soil could be
   controlled considerably by subsurface drainage. The iron transformations
   were not serious enough to cause concern for rice cultivation when
   subsurface drainage was adopted. Accumulation of sulphates in insoluble
   form occurred during drainage due to the oxidation of pyrite. Subsurface
   drainage was also very efficient in leaching sodium, calcium and
   magnesium. Chloride content in soil decreased drastically during
   drainage. (C): 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorothalonil (CTN) is a chlorinated wide-spectrum fungicide, heavily
   and widely applied throughout the world. This study was undertaken to
   directly evaluate the rates and forms of C-14-labeled CTN dissipation in
   three acid Brazilian soils (Typic Humaquept {[}GH], Typic
   Quartzipsamment {[}AQ], and Typic Hapludox {[}LE]). Mineralization was
   not the major metabolic pathway of CTN-degrading microorganisms.
   However, CTN dissipation was fast in all soils and was mainly due to
   biodegradation (responsible for 50\%, 54\%, and 73\% of C-14-CTN
   dissipation in the GH, LE, and AQ soils, respectively), as well as to
   formation of soil-bound C-14 residues (responsible for 46\%, 34\%, and
   18\% of C-14-CTN dissipation in the GH, LE, and AQ soils, respectively).
   Most soil-bound C-14 residues were formed in the first day, but aging
   also contributed to the formation of less reversible forms of CTN-soil
   complexes. In these acid soils, the most abundant metabolite formed from
   CTN degradation was 3-carbamyl-2,4,5-trichlorobenzoic acid. A
   significant fraction of the CTN that had been assumed to be rapidly
   degradable in soils in previous reports has turned out to be soil-bound
   residues. Although bioavailability of any compound is reduced when soil
   complexes are formed, further research is needed to evaluate
   accumulation and availability of CTN soil-bound residues over long-term
   applications, and the consequent detrimental effects on the environment
   and on soil quality and fertility.}},

Abstract = {{Popular and official representations of the environment in Burkina Faso
   present soils as fragile and potentially subject to catastrophic
   collapses in fertility. In the cotton-growing zone of southwestern
   Burkina Faso, researchers and policy-makers attribute changes in land
   cover and land quality to population growth. This paper presents
   evidence questioning the dominant ``population-degradation narrative{''}
   as applied to Burkina. We find that farmers are intensifying their
   production systems. While population has led to land scarcity, farmers
   are responding to both the resulting uncertainty in land rights and
   reductions in soil quality by intensifying the production process.
   Investments are used both as a soil-building and a tenure-building
   strategy. Instead of producing an optimistic intensification
   counternarrative, we contend that intensification is a process with
   social costs. A more complex intensification narrative should encompass
   elements of changing asset distribution, expropriation, and conflict in
   the process whereby individuals and social groups vie for land rights
   and invest in intensified production processes (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

   functions is essential to determine the sustainability of management
   systems. This paper presents an approach to determine the relative
   sustainability of agricultural practices. A simple ranking procedure
   using a relative scoring method is proposed to discriminate among
   treatments based on the status of crop and soil parameters within
   different agroecosystem functions. Summing scores across agroecosystem
   functions allows for the identification of agricultural practices that
   are performing optimally based on functions included in the procedure.
   An example, using data from a long-term cropping systems experiment in
   the western Corn Belt, found the indexing procedure to successfully
   discern differences in overall performance across four agroecosystem
   functions between conventional {[}continuous corn (Zea mays L.) cropping
   sequence at a fertilization rate of 180 kg N ha-l] and alternative
   \{corn-oat (Avena saliva L.) + clover (Trifolium pratense L.)-grain
   sorghum {[}Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-soybean {[}Glycine mau (L.)
   Merr.] cropping sequence at a fertilization rate of 90 kg N ha(-1)\}
   management systems. The simplicity, inclusiveness, and inherent
   flexibility of the indexing procedure can be considered benefits and
   drawbacks, depending on the point of view taken. Data requirements of
   the approach, however, are stringent. Consequently, its most appropriate
   use may be with data from long-term agroecosystem experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been increased interest in long-term,
   field-scale cropping systems research to improve pest management, to
   protect air and soil quality, and to increase or maintain growers'
   profits. However, these studies require large tracts of land; sizeable
   labor forces, and substantial inventories of equipment, which make them
   very expensive to conduct. Because of recent concerns about reducing
   field research casts, this study. compares economic and biological
   results from an original complete 6-yr integrated cropping management
   (ICM) systems field study to results from several downsized experiments,
   which were components of the :complete study. Compared with the original
   ICM study, the downsized experiments reduced the number of treatment
   replications from four to three, reduced the number of crop rotation
   cycles from two to one (from 6 to 3 yr), or only grew one crop per
   rotation each year. The effect of downsizing on the profitability
   analysis and the statistical (biological) analysis were similar.
   Reducing replications altered both profitability and biological
   conclusions less than reducing the number of rotation cycles. Reducing
   crop rotation cycles markedly altered treatment profitability rankings
   compared with the complete study. Growing only one crop in a rotation
   per year was the most detrimental to biological results and entirely
   precluded computing mean annual cropping system profitability. This
   empirical study supports the importance of replicating treatments fully
   over time, over space, and over crop rotational positions.}},

Abstract = {{Significant variations were found in soil texture, levels of organic
   carbon, microbial biomass carbon, nitrate, and nitrification rates in
   the upper 20 cm of soil from three distinct Uplands forest, Cohune Palm
   forest, and Bajo forest habitats within the subtropical rainforest of
   Northwestern Belize. The Cohune Palm forest soils had the most organic
   carbon, microbial biomass carbon, nitrate, and highest nitrification
   rates, while the soils from the Bajo forests had the lowest levels of
   these parameters. The heterogeneity in the soil composition is even more
   significant given that the three habitats studied are part of the same
   `forest' and are within 2 km of each other.
   The first rains at the beginning of the wet season had a rapid and
   significant effect on various components in the soil. A rapid increase
   in the microbial biomass carbon, organic carbon, and nitrification rates
   and a decrease in nitrate occurred in the soil from all three habitats
   within hours after what locals anecdotally consider the start of the wet
   season. The greatest percent change in all factors following the rains
   occurred within the soil from the Bajo forests, while the smallest
   percent change occurred within soil from the Uplands forest.
   There were also significant correlations found between soil moisture
   levels and organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, and nitrification
   rates. The variations in the measured parameters were also associated
   with the amount of clay in the soil. It appears, then, that the amounts
   of moisture and clay are most critical soil composition factors which
   when combined with microbial biomass carbon, organic carbon, and
   nitrification rates may be good predictors of soil quality in these
   forests. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The aim of this paper was to demonstrate the possibility to
   use some soil biochemical parameters as effective indicators for
   defining soil biological fertility status. In this article, results
   obtained from different studies carried out in Mediterranean ecosystems
   were reported in order to evaluate the ``quality{''} of natural forest
   soils or undergoing the pressure of different degenerative processes.
   Methods. Some parameters able to describe microbial biomass activity in
   soil (metabolic quotient, potentially mineralisable carbon, microbial
   biomass carbon/total organic carbon ratio, C-mineralisation kinetic)
   were considered.
   Results. Results showed that disturbed sites were characterised by high
   mineralisation activity, high metabolic quotient and low microbial
   C/total organic C ratio, while undisturbed sites showed the opposite
   trend In the case of natural forest systems, the more homogeneous was
   the vegetal cover, the slower was the microbial activity; in contrast,
   mixed forest sites were characterised by elevated amounts of mineralised
   organic carbon and corresponding high values of metabolic quotients.
   Conclusions. These studies indicated that the parameters considered
   could be effective as both indicators of soil disturbance and soil-state
   descriptors for natural systems, suggesting to take them into account as
   soil quality indicators, when a ``restoration programme{''} is planned.}},

Abstract = {{Treading by grazing animals can have a significant adverse effect on
   soil properties and plant growth, particularly under wet soil
   conditions. It may also affect water and nutrient movement over and
   through soil. It is difficult to assess treading with live animals under
   controlled conditions, when the field plots are small or where there are
   instruments installed. This paper describes a mechanical cow hoof device
   which can overcome these difficulties. The mechanical hoof consists of
   an artificial hoof made of mild steel mounted onto a compressed air ram,
   which, in turn, is driven by an air compressor system. Treading
   pressure, treading speed, duration of hoof-soil contact, and intensity
   and location of treading can all be controlled. Tests of the mechanical
   hoof in a simple field plot experiment showed that, over a 5-8-month
   period, treading increased bulk density (from 1.18 to 1.29 Mg m(-3));
   decreased macroporosity (diam. > 30 mum) (from 16.5\% to 10\% v/v) in
   the top 10 cm soil, and reduced pasture yield (from 100 to 91\% of
   relative dry matter yield). The mechanical hoof device can sen e as a
   useful tool for studying the effect of treading on soil quality
   indicators, water and solute movement, and plant production under
   controlled conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A fast and convenient soil analytical technique is needed for soil
   quality assessment and precision soil management. The main objective of
   this study was to evaluate the ability of near-infrared reflectance
   spectroscopy (NIRS) to predict diverse soil properties, Near-infrared
   reflectance spectra, obtained from a Perstrop NIR Systems 6500 scanning
   monochromator (Foss NIRSystems, Silver Spring, MD), and 33 chemical,
   physical, and biochemical properties were studied for 802 soil samples
   collected from four Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs). Calibrations were
   based on principal component regression (PCR) using the first
   derivatives of optical density {[}log(YR)I for the 1300- to 2500-nm
   spectral range. Total C, total N, moisture, cation-exchange capacity
   (CEC), 1.5 MPa water, basal respiration rate, sand, silt, and Mehlich
   III extractable Ca were successfully predicted by NIRS (r(2) > 0.80).
   Some Mehlich III extractable metals (Fe, K, Mg, Mn) and exchangeable
   cations (Ca, Mg, and K), sum of exchangeable bases, exchangeable
   acidity, clay, potentially mineralizable N, total respiration rate,
   biomass C, and pH were also estimated by NIRS but with less accuracy
   (r(2) = 0.80 similar to0.50). The predicted results For aggregation
   (wt\% > 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25 mm, and macroaggregation) were not reliable
   (r(2) = 0.46 similar to0.60). Mehlich III extractable Cu, P, and Zn, and
   exchangeable Na could not be predicted using the NIRS-PCR technique
   (r(2) < 0.50), The results indicate that NIRS can be used as a rapid
   analytical technique to simultaneously estimate several soil properties
   with acceptable accuracy in a very short time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the sequential decision to adopt two site-specific

   farm location was a key variable influencing adoption of soil testing,
   farm size, human capital, and innovativeness of farmers had a
   significant impact on adoption of variable rate technology in four
   Midwestern states. A double selectivity model applied to correct for
   sample selection bias shows that adoption leads to significant gains in
   nitrogen productivity for farms with below average soil quality but
   statistically insignificant gains for farms with above average soil

Abstract = {{In a survey of 42 farm sites, comprising grassland and two types of
   horticultural farms (growing vegetables or flower bulbs), earthworm
   communities were sampled by hand-sorting and a number of soil
   physicochemical characteristics recorded. For heavy metals the
   availability in the soil solution was estimated based on the measured
   absolute content. Abundance, biomass and species richness were
   significantly higher in grassland soils than in horticultural soils, and
   within the horticultural farms significantly higher in vegetable than in
   flower-bulb farms. No epigeic species were found in horticultural soils.
   The differences between the various farm types were probably related to
   the intensity of management practices, such as soil tillage, harvesting
   and crop protection measures, that result in less soil organic matter of
   lower quality. The data from the grassland farms were analyzed in
   conjunction with the physico-chemical soil characteristics, applying
   canonical correspondence analysis. Community parameters such as species
   richness and diversity apparently were not related to soil
   characteristics, but an appreciable part of the variation in abundance
   and biomass of several individual species could be explained by factors
   such as lutum content (particles < 16 <mu>m), pH, bio-availability of
   metal ions and geographical position of the sample site. It is concluded
   that repeated surveys of this type may become a valuable tool for
   monitoring soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Legume-based cropping systems could help to increase crop productivity
   and soil organic matter levels, thereby enhancing soil quality, as well
   as having the additional benefit of sequestering atmospheric C. To
   evaluate the effects of 35 yr of maize monoculture and legume-based
   cropping on soil C levels and residue retention, we measured organic C
   and C-13 natural abundance in soils under: fertilized and unfertilized
   maize (Zea mays L.), both in monoculture and legume-based {[}maize-oat
   (Avena sativa L.)-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-alfalfa] rotations;
   fertilized and unfertilized systems of continuous grass (Poa pratensis
   L.); and under forest. Solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   was used to chemically characterize the organic matter in plant residues
   and soils. Soils (70-cm depth) under maize cropping had about 30-40\%
   less C, and those under continuous grass had about 16\% less C, than
   those under adjacent forest. Qualitative differences in crop residues
   were important in these systems, because quantitative differences in net
   primary productivity and C inputs in the different agroecosystems did
   not account for observed differences in total soil C. Cropping sequence
   (i.e,, rotation or monoculture) had a greater effect on soil C levels
   than application of fertilizer. The difference in soil C levels between
   rotation and monoculture maize systems was about 20 Mg C ha(-1). The
   effects of fertilization on soil C were small (similar to6 Mg C ha(-1)),
   and differences were observed only in the monoculture system. The NMR
   results suggest that the chemical composition of organic matter was
   little affected by the nature of crop residues returned to the soil. The
   total quantity of maize-derived soil C was different in each system,
   because the quantity of maize residue returned to the soil was
   different; hence the maize-derived soil C ranged from 23 Mg ha(-1) in
   the fertilized and 14 Mg ha(-1) in the unfertilized monoculture soils
   (i.e., after 35 maize crops) to 6-7 Mg ha(-1) in both the fertilized and
   unfertilized legume-based rotation soils (i.e.. after eight maize
   crops). The proportion of maize residue C returned to the soil and
   retained as soil organic C (i.e., Mg maize-derived soil C/Mg maize
   residue) was about 14\% for all maize cropping systems. The quantity of
   C3-C below the plow layer in legume-based rotation was 40\% greater than
   that in monoculture and about the same as that under either continuous
   grass or forest. The soil organic matter below the plow layer in soil
   under the legume-based rotation appeared to be in a more biologically
   resistant form (i.e., higher aromatic C content) compared with that
   under monoculture. The retention of maize residue C as soil organic
   matter was four to five times greater below the plow layer than that
   within the plow layer. We conclude that residue quality plays a key role
   in increasing the retention of soil C in agroecosystems and that soils
   under legume-based rotation tend to be more ``preservative{''} of
   residue C inputs. particularly from root inputs, than soils under
   monoculture.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed papermill residues (MPR) can improve soil quality, but their
   impact on forage yield and quality is not well documented. Three MPR
   were applied to mixed grass-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) sward in 1997
   and 1998 at near 100, 200 and 400 kg N ha(-1) and were compared to
   calcic ammonium nitrate (CAN) at 0, 50, 100 and 200 kg N ha(-1) on a
   Bedford clay loam (Humic Gleysol). The MPR and CAN induced a significant
   linear increase in forage DM yield and relative yield (RY). The award
   response to MPR addition in 1997 was related to the MPR C:NH4+ ratio.
   MPR and CAN increased the forage NDF concentration in 1998, but there
   was no effect in 1997. Nitrogen concentration in forage tissues was
   increased by MPR and CAN inputs in 1997, but was decreased in 1998. In
   all treatments, NO, tended to accumulate in forage tissues when the N
   nutrition index (INN) exceeded the optimum level. Forage nutritive value
   from the MPR was comparable to CAN. The results of this study suggest
   that MPR can be an efficient N source for grass-alfalfa swards on
   fine-textured soils.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the resistance
   of beech foliage (Fagus sylvatica) against oxidative stress was affected
   by soil quality, nitrogen or CO2 fertilisation, or lachnid infestation
   (Phyllaphis fagi). For this purpose young beech trees were grown for
   four years in reconstructed calcareous or acidic forest soils in open
   top chambers under ambient or elevated CO2 concentrations with two
   levels of nitrogen fertilisation. At harvest lachnid colonisation was
   observed, preferentially on leaves from trees in calcareous soil and on
   leaves from trees fertilised with the high nitrogen level. General leaf
   characteristics such as pigment concentrations, dry mass, and leaf mass
   er area were not affected by the soil type, nitrogen fertilisation or
   CO2 regime. Leaves colonised with lachnids displayed slightly increased
   leaf mass per area. When the stress resistance was challenged by
   exposure to paraquat - a herbicide inducing oxidative stress - leaves
   from trees grown on calcareous soil maintained significantly longer
   membrane integrity and, thus, were better protected against stress than
   leaves from trees on acidic soil. Other experimental variables had
   negligible or no effects on the resistance against oxidative stress.}},

Abstract = {{Young beech (Fagus sylvatica) and spruce (Picea abies) trees from
   different provenances or genotypes were grown in competition in large
   model ecosystems and were exposed to two concentrations of atmospheric
   CO2 (370 vs 570 mu mol mol(-1)), two levers of wet nitrogen deposition
   (7 vs 70 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)); and two native forest soils (acidic vs
   calcareous) for four years in open-top chambers. The 2 x 2 x 2 factorial
   experimental design was fully replicated (n = 4) with each CO2 x N
   combination applied to each soil type. Exposure to atmospheric CO2
   enrichment stimulated daytime net ecosystem CO2 flux (NEC) as measured
   during sunny days in the middle of the third growing season.
   Nevertheless, we observed substantial down-regulation of NEC, with
   larger adjustments on acidic than on calcareous soil. NEC adjustment was
   associated with slightly reduced leaf area index (LAI) on the acidic
   soil (no response on calcareous soil), enhanced soil CO2 efflux from
   both substrate types, and, most importantly, with down-regulation of CO2
   uptake at the leaf scale. Downward adjustment of light-saturated
   single-leaf photosynthesis (A) and of Rubisco was more pronounced in
   beech than in spruce and these species-specific differences increased
   over time. By year four, A adjustment (except in one specific treatment
   combination in each species) had become complete in beech but had
   disappeared in spruce. At no time did we observe a genotype or
   provenance effect on the downward adjustment of carbon fluxes, and
   nitrogen deposition rate generally had little effect as well. Overall,
   our results suggest that tree species and soil quality will have
   profound effects on ecosystem CO2 fluxes under continued atmospheric CO2
   enrichment.}},

Abstract = {{Minimum tillage in conjunction with crop residue mulch may be a
   promising practice of soil management to improve soil properties and
   crop production in the subtropical climate of north-western Punjab.
   Therefore, a 5-year field experiment was conducted to study the effect
   of tillage and crop residue mulch on some properties of a sandy loam
   soil (Fluvisol) cropped to rainfed maize (Zen mays L.)-wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L.) sequence. Three main treatments investigated were minimum
   tillage (consisting of making a small trench for seed placement) with 3
   Mg ha(-1) crop residue mulch of the previous crop (MTR), minimum tillage
   without residue mulch (MT), and conventional tillage (involving two
   diskings followed by a planking) without residue mulch (CT).
   Subtreatments consisted of five rates of fertilizer N (0. 40, 80. 120
   and 160 kg ha(-1)) applied to wheat. Maize received 80 kg N, 17 kg P and
   16 kg K ha(-1). Soil quality in terms of increased organic matter
   content. water retention, infiltration of water and aggregation. and
   decreased bulk density of the surface soil was improved in the MTR
   relative to other treatments. Pooled grain yield in the MTR treatment
   remained below the CT treatment during the first 2 years (1993 and 1994)
   but was subsequently greater than the CT. However, grain yield in the MT
   treatment was lower than CT treatment throughout the study period. The
   results indicated the necessity of using residue mulch in conjunction
   with minimum tillage in order to improve soil quality and
   sustain/improve crop production. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{In many countries ground vegetation and humus type are used as
   indicators of forest soil quality, especially nutrient regime. This
   paper reports the development of such methods for use in British
   forests, within a new Ecological Site Classification combining climate,
   soil moisture regime and soil nutrient regime.
   To develop a field assessment method for soil nutrient regime, a study
   was made of soil chemistry, humus type and ground vegetation in British
   forests. Sites were selected in both mature plantations and semi-natural
   woodlands. Soil and humus profiles were described and the soil was
   sampled volumetrically for later chemical analysis. Vascular ground
   vegetation was recorded in quadrats by species cover fraction, and
   classified according to the existing British National Vegetation
   Classification. Soils were analyzed for a number of chemical variables.
   Vegetation data were treated by application of the species indicator
   values for soil reaction (R) and soil nitrogen (N), as proposed by
   Ellenberg {[}Vegetation Ecology of Central Europe, 4th Edition.
   Cambridge University Press, Cambridge]. Site mean indicator values mR
   and mN (weighted by species cover fraction) were then calculated.
   Multivariate statistical analysis techniques were applied to both the
   soil chemical and the vegetation sample data.
   Soil nutrient regime was shown to be a composite gradient of several
   soil chemical variables, of which the pH value and the availability of
   mineral (especially nitrate) nitrogen, and of calcium, were of
   particular importance. The species composition of the ground vegetation
   was related to position on this soil nutrient gradient. The vegetation:
   soil nutrient correlation using the site mean Ellenberg values was
   satisfactory (r=0.89), but was improved by using indicator values
   generated from within the present data. The occurrence of the major
   humus types (mor, moder and mull) is broadly related to soil nutrient
   regime defined in this way. Both ground vegetation and humus type can
   therefore be used as soil nutrient indicators in British forests.
   A division of the soil nutrient gradient into five classes (Very Poor,
   Poor, Medium, Rich and Very Rich) is proposed. Future sampling work may
   lead to the definition of an additional class of soils with carbonate
   nutrient regimes. The Ecological Site Classification will provide forest
   managers in Great Britain with an improved basis for the selection of
   tree species for planting, and the adoption of silvicultural methods
   best suited to the site. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Dysart Woods is a 23 ha old-growth remnant of mixed mesophytic
   vegetation located in southeastern Ohio, USA. A designation of mixed
   mesophytic for this forest has historically been difficult, in part due
   to the abundance of white oak (Quercus alba); however, the dominance of
   a variety of other hardwoods prevents a simple oak forest designation.
   Using two 0.35 ha plots on opposing north- and south-facing slopes, we
   describe the structure and composition of the overstory, understory, and
   soils, 30 years after their first examination. In 1970, the woods was
   dominated by beech (Fagus grandifolia), white oak, and sugar maple (Acer
   saccharum) - historically, the three most abundant species in this
   region. At that time, white oak was only present in the largest size
   classes, was not regenerating, and was predicted to decline in
   importance through succession. These patterns continue today suggesting
   that inferences made via overstory-understory relations in regards to
   forest succession are relatively robust over this time period. Beech and
   maple have increased in importance; white oak has decreased in
   importance due to mortality in the larger size classes and decreasing
   density due to regeneration failure. Coarse woody debris distributions
   correlated strongly with living stem species' composition and structure
   implying an equilibrium balance. CWD volume and frequency were dominated
   by Quercus spp. A detailed analysis of forest health showed that all oak
   species were in severe decline. The oaks are in a disease decline spiral
   affiliated with a variety of pre-disposing and inciting factors which
   include their advanced age (>300 years), their large size (> 100 cm
   DBH), topography, chronic air pollution, drought, and Armillaria root
   rot fungus. Ca:AI molar ratios in the soil are also extremely low (<1.0)
   and may be having an additional detrimental effect. All other canopy
   species appear to be healthy. One of the unusual features of this woods
   is its relatively diverse and high coverage (up to 90\%) understory
   layer. The herbaceous community was sampled throughout the growing
   season and found to be markedly dissimilar among sample times and
   habitat productivity (aspect, soil quality, and light). The role of
   these factors has not been as well studied for herb communities as it
   has for tree communities. There appears to be a relatively strong
   linkage between the overstory regeneration and understory coverage.
   While a variety of woody seedlings were discovered, most were of shade
   tolerant species. Only a few small seedlings of white oak were
   discovered, with none advancing past 30 cm in height, indicating strong
   competition in the understory. Furthermore, this small remnant forest
   patch is surrounded by an agricultural and second-growth forest matrix
   with many non-indigenous plants none of which have been able to enter
   the woods, suggesting strong equilibrium stability of these old-growth
   patches. The hardwood forests of the hills region has been heavily
   impacted by various human cultures for thousands of years.
   Dendrochronological analysis of a full basal slab cut from a wind-thrown
   white oak revealed a fairly active period of fire following European
   settlement. A lack of fire during the early 1600s to mid 1700s suggests
   that pre-Anglo fire frequency may have been negligible. There is clearly
   a continued role for the preservation and study of these old-growth
   remnants. They remain integrally important as we attempt to understand
   and better manage our remaining anthropogenically disturbed landscape,

Abstract = {{Within the member countries of the European Union, different strategies
   and guidelines for the sampling and the preparation of soils are used to
   investigate soil contamination. As a consequence, there is reasonable
   doubt that the results gained by applying these different strategies and
   methods are comparable. In general, the relative contribution of
   sampling and sample preparation to the total uncertainty in soil
   contamination studies is a subject of speculation than of knowledge. For
   this purpose, the first European soil sampling inter-comparison test was
   organised as a project under the Standards, Measurement and Testing
   Programme of the European Commission. The aim of this project was to
   analyse and to compare the existing guidelines, the degree and the state
   of standardisation in this field in the European countries, and to
   compare their results when applied on the same test area under
   comparable conditions by representative sampling teams. The results of
   the project in general demonstrate that sampling and sample preparation
   errors reach about the same order of magnitude as errors caused in the
   chemical analysis. However, there are great differences depending on the
   elements investigated and their concentration ranges, as well as on
   pedological and land-use conditions in the test area. Consequently,
   sampling and sample preparation require the same attentiveness and
   equivalent measures for quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC)
   as the chemical analysis, which has not been the case up to now.
   Insufficient comparability of the results is illustrated by the fact
   that different participants arrive at different conclusions for up to
   61\% of tested soil quality criteria (e.g. threshold levels). The
   methods and results of the project are presented in detail in the six
   following papers within this volume. The following 13 papers present
   some key studies and specific contributions of the participants, as well
   as synoptical papers of the invited experts in standardisation and
   accreditation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The soil sampling guidelines used in European countries (ESSG), as
   kindly provided by the national institutions which participated in the
   project, have been recorded, studied, evaluated and presented in this
   paper. The aim has been to ascertain what soil sampling guidelines exist
   in Europe; to detect similarities and differences (comparable results),
   advantages and deficiencies; to identify incompatible strategies and
   evaluate how methodologies might affect data quality; to investigate
   sources of deviations or uncertainties; to improve comparability and
   representativeness of soil sampling: to investigate the need for
   harmonised sampling guidelines; and to develop suggestions for standard
   operating procedures (SOP), Soil sampling guidelines throughout Europe
   differ as to whether they are applied by law, or used throughout the
   country. In some countries these are ISO/DIS related or based (ISO
   10381-1, 1995; ISO 10381-2, 1995), or are produced by a scientific
   society or a standardisation body. As far as sampling strategy is
   concerned, not all sampling guidelines clearly describe the sampling
   scale, the specifications for contamination risk precautions, the
   sampling plan and protocol structure and the pre-analysis treatment of
   the soil samples. The purpose for sampling, in descending order of
   frequency, is soil pollution, soil fertilisation, general soil
   monitoring, background risk assessment, or else it is not specified. The
   majority of countries do not sample the top organic matter separately.
   Sampling depth is either related to the morphogenetic horizon or to ad
   hoc sampling depth, which is not specified in all cases. They suggest
   mass- and volume-related soil sampling, while the sampling pattern is
   not presented in all national guidelines. The criteria for area, site,
   unit, sub-unit, and point selection are mainly based on pedology and
   land use, following the history and pre-screening information or
   geology, or is site related. Some guidelines suggest the division of
   sampling units into sub-units. The sampling pattern is mainly grid
   sampling, grid and random sampling, or not mentioned. Sampling density
   inside the sampling unit either varies greatly or it is not mentioned,
   while the size of the sampling unit varies widely. Most guidelines
   require the collection of composite instead of simple samples, while
   some prefer sampling soil profiles. In the European SSG many technical
   details and steps are either not defined or vary, while in the
   pre-analysis treatment quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC)
   approaches are used either both in the lab and in the field, or only in
   the field, or are not mentioned. The common points and the points in
   which harmonisation could be started or achieved are discussed. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Fifteen institutions from 13 European countries and Switzerland
   participated in a comparative test sampling at the Dornach site, near
   Basel in Switzerland. They received the site description and were asked
   to develop their own sampling plans, based on their national guidelines
   for a three-dimensional description of the Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd pollution,
   with a maximum of 15 samples. The comparative sampling test took place
   in late August 1997. The sampling plans and records, provided by the
   participants, were compared and evaluated in terms of sampling strategy
   throughout the site, the sampling strategy inside the sampling unit,
   strategy at the sampling point and last minute alteration of the
   sampling plans in the field. The object of this was to define the
   similarities and the differences in the sampling plans and identify the
   crucial steps inducing error or uncertainty which should be harmonized
   throughout Europe. The number of the total composite samples varied from
   4 to 16, while the number of sampling points varied from 4 to 224 and
   the sampling density varied from 0.25 to 16 single samples per 100 m(2).
   The number of 10 x 10 m(2) quadrats from which samples were taken varied
   from 3 to 56, out of the total 61. The number of sampling units varied
   between 3 and 12. The criteria in descending order of frequency were:
   both land use and pedology, land use, pedology. The majority of the
   national participants divided the sampling units into two or three
   sub-units, while seven participants collected replicate composite
   samples from the same sampling unit. Only one sampled from the existing
   profiles, eight national representatives ignored the plough depth. The
   sampling pattern inside the sampling unit was in descending order of
   frequency: random, point sampling, regular, `W' and `X' shaped sampling.
   The number of single samples in the composite varied from 1 to 20. Most
   of the national participants sampled to pre-defined (ad-hoc) sampling
   depths, while others sampled soil horizons and others both. The maximum
   soil depth sampled also varied from 20 to 117 cm. Most participants
   mixed in the top organic matter horizon while others sampled it
   separately. Most sampled separately the top Ah horizon in the forest
   while the rest mixed it with the underlying soil horizon. The
   last-minute sampling plan alterations were in: the sampling depth
   (nine), the movement of sampling points (five), the reduction of
   sub-samples in the composite sample (four), changes in the number of
   sampling units (three), ignoring the bottom sample (three), not sampling
   the L/H layer (three) although this was planned, unplanned sampling of
   the L/H layer (two) and changing the number of planned samples (two).
   This study has highlighted the need for soil sampling harmonization
   throughout Europe for pollution and soil quality determination. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The aim of the CEEM soil project was to compare and to test the soil
   sampling and sample preparation guidelines used in the member states of
   the European Union and Switzerland for investigations of background and
   large-scale contamination of soils, soil monitoring and environmental
   risk assessments. The results of the comparative evaluation of the
   sampling guidelines demonstrated that, in soil contamination studies
   carried out with different sampling strategies and methods, comparable
   results can hardly be expected. Therefore, a reference database (RDB)
   was established by the organisers, which acted as a basis for the
   quantitative comparison of the participants' results. The detected
   deviations were related to the methodological details of the individual
   strategies. The comparative evaluation concept consisted of three steps:
   The first step was a comparison of the participants' samples (which were
   both centrally and individually analysed) between each other, as well as
   with the reference data base (RDB) and some given soil quality standards
   on the level of concentrations present. The comparison was made using
   the example of the metals cadmium, copper, lead and zinc. As a second
   step, the absolute and relative deviations between the reference
   database and the participants' results (both centrally analysed under
   repeatability conditions) were calculated. The comparability of the
   samples with the RDB was categorised on four levels. Methods of
   exploratory statistical analysis were applied to estimate the
   differential method bias among the participants. The levels of error
   caused by sampling and sample preparation were compared with those
   caused by the analytical procedures. As a third step, the methodological
   profiles of the participants were compiled to concisely describe the
   different procedures used. They were related to the results to find out
   the main factors leading to their incomparability. The outcome of this
   evaluation process was a list of strategies and methods, which are
   problematic with respect to comparability, and should be standardised
   and/or specified in order to arrive at representative and comparable
   results in soil contamination studies throughout Europe. Pre-normative
   recommendations for harmonising European soil sampling guidelines and
   standard operating procedures have been outlined in Wagner G, Desules A,
   Muntau H, Theocharopoulos S. Comparative Evaluation of European Methods

Abstract = {{Over the last 10 years, considerable progress has been made in defining
   and assessing soil health and soil quality. However, problems still
   exist in the interpretation of soil quality indicators due to the
   complexity and interrelatedness of soil processes. Additionally, the
   crop production system selected by growers affects the potential for the
   adoption of practices promoting soil health. Factors influencing the
   selection of the crop production system include the marketing strategy
   adopted by the grower, the commodity value, the cultural practices and
   inputs used to grow the crop (e.g. fertilisers, pesticides, etc.). To
   date, growers have had little time to consider the impact of soil health
   on crop production. Plant pathology, however, and related disciplines
   have made major contributions to the understanding of soil health,
   particularly in the area of the identification and verification of
   disease-suppressive soils and the agents responsible for this
   suppression. The linkage of plant health to the functional diversity of
   biological communities in the soil has been far more elusive, but is
   rapidly becoming more important as consumers and markets push for
   environmental sustainability. To further progress our understanding of
   soil health and facilitate its application to production agriculture,
   plant pathologists should identify and focus on crop production systems
   that are amenable to showing a return on investment in soil health.}},

Abstract = {{Results from the first phase of a long-term experiment showed that,
   after 6 years under pasture, several soil quality attributes had
   improved compared with soil cropped annually. The objectives of this
   study were to quantify the effects of pasture-induced increases in
   structural stability and organic matter (N fertility) on wheat grown in
   3 successive seasons following pasture cultivation. Growing winter wheat
   after the ploughing of land that had previously grown perennial grass
   resulted in gradual reductions in soil organic C and total N. Reductions
   in soil microbial biomass C and earthworm populations were much more
   rapid. Soil aggregate stability declined rapidly in the first year after
   ploughing, but more slowly after that. Soil macroporosity increased
   after ploughing, mainly due to the relief of compaction caused by sheep
   treading during grazing. The contrasting soil conditions that existed at
   the end of the first experimental phase significantly affected the
   harvest yield of the first and second wheat crops, with yields 2-3 t/ha
   greater after perennial grasses than after annual crops. Variations in
   harvest yield and N uptake were explained by differences in soil N
   fertility and soil structural conditions. Treatment effects on yield
   were not detected in the third wheat crop. For the structural condition
   and N fertility of this soil, the extent of improvement during 3 years
   under perennial pasture was similar to the extent of decline under 3
   years of cropping. This suggests that similar lengths of pastoral and
   arable cropping are needed in crop rotations for the long-term
   maintenance of these properties in weakly structured silt loam soils in
   New Zealand.}},

Title = {{Rotation crops for irrigated cotton in a medium-fine, self-mulching,

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{317-328}},
Abstract = {{Many cotton growers sow rotation crops after irrigated cotton (Gossypium
   hirsutum L.), assuming that they will improve soil quality and maintain
   profitability of cotton. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most common
   rotation crop, although more recently, legumes such as faba bean (Vicia
   Faba L.) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) have come into favour. This
   paper reports data on soil quality (organic C, nitrate-N, soil
   structure), yield (cotton lint and rotation crop grain yield, fibre
   quality), economic returns (gross margins/ha, gross margins/ML
   irrigation water), and management constraints from an experiment
   conducted from 1993 to 1998 near Wee Waa, north-western New South Wales,
   Australia. The soil is a medium-fine, self-mulching, grey Vertosol. The
   cropping sequences used were cotton followed by N-fertilised wheat (urea
   at 140 kg N/ha in 1993; 120 kg N/ha thereafter), unfertilised wheat, and
   unfertilised grain legumes (chickpea in 1993; faba bean thereafter),
   which were either harvested or the grain incorporated during land
   preparation. Soil organic C in the 0-0.6 m depth was not affected by the
   rotation crop, although variations occurred between times of sampling.
   Regression analysis indicated that there had been no net gain or loss of
   organic C between June 1993 and October 1998. Sowing leguminous rotation
   crops increased nitrate-N values. A net increase in root-zone nitrate-N
   reserves occurred with time (from June 1993 to October 1998) with all
   rotation crops. Soil compaction (measured as specific volume of
   oven-dried soil) was lower with wheat by October 1998. A net decrease in
   soil compaction occurred in the surface 0.15 m with all rotation crops
   between 1993 and 1998, whereas it increased in the 0.15-0.60 m depth.
   Cotton lint yield and quality, and gross margins/ha and gross
   margins/ML, were always higher where wheat was sown, with highest gross
   margins occurring when N fertiliser was applied. Applying N fertiliser
   to wheat did not significantly increase cotton lint yield and fibre
   quality, but increased gross margins of the cotton-wheat sequence due to
   higher wheat yield and protein percentage. Lint yield and fibre quality
   were decreased by sowing leguminous rotation crops. Management
   constraints such as lack of effective herbicides, insect damage,
   harvesting damage, and availability of suitable marketing options were
   greater with legumes than with wheat. Overall, wheat was a better
   rotation crop than grain legumes for irrigated cotton.}},

Title = {{Soil organic matter in rainfed cropping systems of the Australian cereal
   belt}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{435-464}},
Abstract = {{The Australian cereal belt stretches as an arc from north-eastern
   Australia to south-western Australia (24 degreesS-40 degreesS and 125
   degreesE-147 degreesE), with mean annual temperatures from 14 degreesC
   (temperate) to 26 degreesC (subtropical), and with annual rainfall
   ranging from 250 mm to 1500 mm. The predominant soil types of the cereal
   belt include Chromosols, Kandosols, Sodosols, and Vertosols, with
   significant areas of Ferrosols, Kurosols, Podosols, and Dermosols,
   covering approximately 20 Mha of arable cropping and 21 Mha of ley
   pastures.
   Cultivation and cropping has led to a substantial loss of soil organic
   matter (SOM) from the Australian cereal belt; the long-term SOM loss
   often exceeds 60\% from the top 0-0.1 m depth after 50 years of cereal
   cropping. Loss of labile components of SOM such as sand-size or
   particulate SOM, microbial biomass, and mineralisable nitrogen has been
   even higher, thus resulting in greater loss in soil productivity than
   that assessed from the loss of total SOM alone. Since SOM is
   heterogeneous in nature, the significance and functions of its various
   components are ambiguous. It is essential that the relationship between
   levels of total SOM or its identifiable components and the most affected
   soil properties be established and then quantified before the
   concentrations or amounts of SOM and/or its components can be used as a
   performance indicator. There is also a need for experimentally
   verifiable soil organic C pools in modelling the dynamics and management
   of SOM. Furthermore, the interaction of environmental pollutants added
   to soil, soil microbial biodiversity, and SOM is poorly understood and
   therefore requires further study. Biophysically appropriate and
   cost-effective management practices for cereal cropping lands are
   required for restoring and maintaining organic matter for sustainable
   agriculture and restoration of degraded lands. The additional benefit of
   SOM restoration will be an increase in the long-term greenhouse C sink,
   which has the potential to reduce greenhouse emissions by about 50 Mt
   CO(2) equivalents/year over a 20-year period, although current improved
   agricultural practices can only sequester an estimated 23\% of the
   potential soil C sink.}},

Abstract = {{In field studies, we assessed the effects of irrigation with dairy
   factory effluent on the surface (0-10 cm) properties of 3 rhyolytic
   tephra soils. Horotiu and Te Kowhai soils had been irrigated for 22
   years and Taupo soil for 2 years. Soil properties measured were: total
   organic C, total N, pH, bulk density, unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity, moisture release characteristics, readily and totally
   available water, particle density, microbial C, soil respiration,
   mineralisable N, denitrification enzyme activity, and nitrification
   potential. Matched, non-irrigated areas were sampled for comparison.
   Average annual loadings (kg/ha) of C, N, and P since 1990 were 1120 kg
   N, 560 kg P, and 36 300 kg C onto Horotiu soil, and 760 kg N, 380 kg P,
   and 25 200 kg C onto the Te Kowhai soil. These post-1990 loadings were,
   on average, 23\% less than pre-1990 values. Irrigation for 22 years onto
   the Horotiu and Te Kowhai soils caused no change, or a slight decrease,
   in total C and N in the topsoil, but microbial C and mineralisable N
   contents were more than doubled, and N cycling activity much increased.
   Soil pH was increased by up to 1.8 units. Unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity was increased from 8.5 to 49.8 mm/h on the Horotiu soil,
   and from 6.5 to 29.0 mm/h on the Te Kowhai soil. Irrigation increased
   the volumetric water content between 10 and 100 kPa. Most of the changes
   in soil properties suggest current application rates and pasture
   production can be maintained or increased. The high loading and
   mineralisation of N in the irrigated soils raises concerns about
   potential leaching of nitrate; current management practices are targeted
   towards minimising N loadings from effluent.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial plant communities of adjacent upland and floodplain forest
   of the Amazonian lowland differ from each other in species richness and
   composition. Epiphytes are generally not considered as being affected by
   flooding, but we found considerable variation in the communities of
   epiphytic Araceae of flooded and unflooded forest. Contrary to findings
   from tree or ground herb communities, no depletion in overall species
   richness was observed among epiphytic aroids of the floodplains.
   Abundance and number of epiphytic aroid species per phorophyte were
   significantly higher than in upland forest, and the species composition
   varied conspicuously between the two forest types. We suggest that these
   differences are due to elevated humidity and better soil quality on the
   floodplains and reject the assumption that flooding has no effect on the
   epiphytic community.}},

   conventional) orchards were studied. At each orchard, soils were sampled
   at three depths (0-50, 50-150, 150-300 mm) in the treeline and alley and
   were analysed for soil physical properties (soil bulk density. SBD; and
   soil infiltration rate. IR). Samples from the top two depths (0-50 and
   50-150 mm) were also analysed for soil chemical (pH, P, K. Ca. Mg, S)
   and biological (earthworm number, fresh biomass and composition:
   microbial biomass C, BC; microbial biomass N, BN: CO(2) evolution)
   parameters. Earthworm parameters were determined to a depth of 0.25 m.
   In general. significantly lower SBD and higher IR occurred in treeline
   than alley in all orchards due to soil compaction by orchard vehicles in
   the alley. The BFP treeline and commercial organic orchard showed lowest
   SBD and highest IR. Soil chemical parameters were found to be related to
   nutrient management practices imposed such as increased K and S in BFP
   treelines due to pea straw additions. Returns of mown clippings from
   alleys to treelines enhanced nutrient transfers and increased nutrient
   levels in treelines of BFP and IFP orchards.
   Earthworm number and biomass were sensitive indicators and were high in
   pea straw-treated treelines of BFP orchards due to substrate additions.
   Although earthworm biomass varied in the alleys between orchards. high
   earthworm numbers occurred in most orchard alleys. Highest number of
   earthworm species were found in BFP and commercial organic orchards. The
   measured soil respiration (CO(2) evolution) showed significant
   differences between soil depths but no significant differences between
   orchard systems except in one sire where BFP showed higher CO(2)
   evolution than IFP or CFP. The BC and BN were significantly higher in
   commercial organic than conventional orchards and in topsoils than
   subsoils in about half of the orchards studied. Overall, sensitive soil
   quality indicators found, capable of distinguishing between orchard
   management treatments, were SBD, IR, earthworm number, fresh biomass and
   composition while those which distinguished between topsoils and subsoil
   were CO(2) evolution. BC and BN.}},

Abstract = {{This article reviews literature about the impacts of cover crops in
   cropping systems that affect soil and water quality and presents limited
   new information to help fill knowledge gaps. Cover crops reduce
   sedimentation production from cropland by , grow during periods when the
   soil might otherwise be fallow. While actively growing, cover crops
   increase solar energy harvest and carbon flux into the soil, providing
   food for soil macro and microrganisms, while simultaneously increasing
   evapotranspiration from the soil. Cover crops reduce sediment production
   from cropland by intercepting the kinetic energy of rainfall and by
   reducing the amount and velocity of runoff. Cover crops increase soil
   quality by improving biological, chemical and physical properties
   including: organic carbon content, cation exchange capacity, aggregate
   stability, and water infiltrability. Legume cover crops contribute a
   nitrogen (N) to subsequent crops. Other cover crops, especially grasses
   and brassicas, are better at scavenging residual N before it can leach.
   Because growth of these scavenging cover crops is usually N limited,
   growing grass/legume mixtures often increases total carbon inputs
   without sacrificing N scavenging efficiency. Cover crops are best
   adapted to warm areas with abundant precipitation. Water use by cover
   crops can adversely impact yields of subsequent dryland crops in
   semiarid areas. Similarly, cooler soil temperatures under cover crop
   residues can retard early growth of subsequent crops grown near the cold
   end of their range of adaptation. Development of systems that reduce the
   costs of cover crop establishment and overcome subsequent crop
   establishment problems will increase cover crop utilization and improve
   soil and water quality.}},

Abstract = {{Cropping systems grown over sandy coarse soils are susceptible to
   nutrient leaching, due to local thunderstorms and irrigation.
   Additionally, erosion can contribute to removal of nutrients, soil
   organic matter, and fine particles. Balancing nutrients for these
   systems while protecting water and soil quality requires best management
   practices (BMPs). Crop rotations with deeper rooted small grains and
   winter cover crops reduced potential losses of fine particles, soil
   organic matter, nitrogen, and other nutrients due to wind erosion and
   protected soil and water quality. The cropping system N status can be
   monitored by assessing chlorophyll, sap NO3--N concentrations and N
   indexes of the canopy. The Nitrogen Leaching Economic Analysis Package
   (NLEAP) model simulated residual soil NO3--N and soil water and showed
   that there is potential to use precision farming to improve NUE.
   Simulations of the system showed that BMPs increased NUE and that NO3--N
   can potentially be removed from the shallow underground water table
   protecting water quality. These results show that with the application
   of models, and tools to monitor the N status of the aboveground canopy,
   such as chlorophyl readings, sap NO3--N concentrations, N indices, and
   other new technologies such as precision farming and remote sensing,
   nutrient use efficiency in the new millennium will be significantly
   increased, environmental quality will be conserved, and product quality
   will be improved at the farm level for the benefit of producers,
   processors and consumers.}},

Abstract = {{The area of study is located in the centre of the Murcia region, in
   Southeast Spain, under a semiarid Mediterranean climate. These soils are
   subject to an eminently agricultural use (60 \%). The main uses
   correspond to marginal degraded areas, unirrigated tree cultures,
   irrigated cultures (trees and horticultural varieties), orchard
   cultures, soil prepared for cultivation and uncultivated soil with
   unaltered vegetation. As field parameters the following have been
   considered: type of soil, use, depth, water erosion, drainage and
   structure. Chemical parameters referring to organic carbon and total
   nitrogen contents, carbon/nitrogen ratio and soil salinity have also
   been determined. Systematic sampling of every km(2) was carried out
   taking 30 cm. deep samples from the soil surface. A total of 42 samples
   were obtained. The field parameters indicate that this is an area where
   a greatly effective soil depth predominates. The most significant
   symptoms of physical degradation are surface sealing and sheet rill and
   gully water erosion, especially in Calcaric Regosols set for unirrigated
   and irrigated tree cultures. These soils usually show lack of structure
   and heavy drainage. As for analytic data, the predominance of low or
   very low contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen is stressed,
   particularly in Regosols. These contents increase slightly in soils set
   for irrigation cultures, giving rise to low CIN ratios. Although most
   soils are not (or just slightly) affected by salinity, the most
   significant values are also observed in irrigated cultures, where the
   original material may contribute these salts. The results obtained
   reveal, as shown on the cartographic study, that inadequate management
   negatively influences soil quality; because of which soil evaluation
   prior to land management is rendered essential.}},

Abstract = {{Two approaches have been basically developed to characterise
   contaminated sites: (i) soil quality standards and (ii) risk assessment.
   Some European countries proposed soil quality standards to characterise
   contaminated sites for a given soil use (e.g. United Kingdom) or even
   for a multipurpose soil use (e.g. The Netherlands). Other countries
   (e.g. USA, Denmark) preferred to use risk assessment for characterising
   contaminated sites.
   However, the combination of soil quality standards with risk assessments
   can be a more reasonable approach (e.g., Germany; and Basque Country,
   Catalonia in Spain). This can really happen if soil quality standards
   are defined in such a way that an adequate balance between the costs
   associated with the errors in characterising sites using the standards
   and the costs associated with carrying out risk assessments in uncertain
   sites is achieved. Furthermore, the consideration of soil variability is
   critical.}},

Abstract = {{Soil carbon is a major determinant of sustainability of agricultural
   systems and changes can occur in both total and active or labile C
   pools. The measurements of soil organic matter (SOM) changes under
   various forms of land use are needed for the development of sustainable
   systems. Soil organic matter quality was assessed by HA:FA ratios
   determined by two fractional methods (Tyurin's in modification
   Ponomareva-Plotnikova and by Kononova-Belchikova method) and by the
   calculation of Carbon Pool Index (CPI) and Lability Index (LI), these
   were used to calculate a Carbon Management Index (CMI). These parameters
   were determined and assessed in arable soil (two sites - on upland and
   colluvial foot slope) and in forest soil (National Nature Reserve) in
   locality Bab. Analyses of paired samples (cropped and uncropped soil)
   have shown high difference in total and labile carbon content, and in
   quality of SOM caused by intensive cultivation. We observed a decline in
   CPI as influence of erosion processes and cultivation, a greater decline
   in LI and hence a decline in CMI. Labile carbon and the CMI can be used
   effectively to monitor the rate of change in soil carbon.}},

   Each soil property selected was graded into five classes - from best

Abstract = {{Interest is growing in the use of by-product from flue gas
   desulfurization (FGD) to reclaim sodic soils by controlling the pH and
   excessive Na+. This study evaluated the effects on corn (Zea mays)
   production and pH and electrical conductivity (EC) of calcareous sodic
   soil during four times of cultivation when the by-product was applied
   once at the first cultivation (Study I) and the impacts on plant and
   soil quality at first cultivation when the by-product was applied to the
   soil at 23,000 kg ha(-1) (Study II). In Study I, the germination rate
   and corn production increased by applying the by-product (0, 5,800,
   11,600, and 23,100 kg ha(-1)), and the greatest total amounts of corn
   production during the four times of cultivation was when the by-product
   was applied at 23,100 kg ha(-1). In Study 11, the pH, exchangeable
   sodium percentage (ESP), clay dispersion and soluble Na+ in the soil
   decreased and soluble Mg2+ and soluble K+ in the soil increased. The
   soil pH was reduced from 9.0 to 7.7 by applying the by-product. However,
   the by-product decreased the concentrations of total N and P in corn
   leaves in this study. No significant difference in the concentrations of
   Mo, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cd, Mn, Cr, Cu, and Al in corn leaves and the soil was
   observed between the by-product addition and the control except for B in
   the soil and Fe in corn leaves. The concentration of B in the soil was
   reduced from 28.7 mg kg(-1) to 25.4 mg kg(-1) and the concentration of

Abstract = {{Modeling deforestation has become increasingly important in analyzing
   the effects of land-cover change on ecosystems. A simulation model based
   on socioeconomic variables was developed and applied to a study area in
   Central Rondonia, Brazil over a 20 year time period. The simulation
   model integrates three submodels of settlement diffusion, land-use
   change, and ecological change and simulates the effects of colonization
   on deforestation by varying a number of parameters (e.g. immigration
   rates, crop productivity, soil quality). We have recently developed a
   Landsat-based logistic regression model of deforestation for the same
   study area in Central Rondonia, Brazil over the 20 year time period. The
   model incorporates five main parameters in predicting the amount of
   deforestation on individual farmer settlement lots. These parameters
   include proximity of a lot to nearest paved road (PPR); proximity of a
   lot to nearest secondary road (PSR); distance to the nearest
   forest/cleared edge (PFC); distance from a market center (DMC); distance
   from a major urban center (DUC). This study evaluates and compares the
   predictive capability of both the image based and integrated model using
   remote sensing analysis and field measurements. The percent cleared and
   spatial metrics of landscape pattern including the patch-per-unit area
   metric (PPU) and square pixel metric (SqP) are used to compare image
   classifications with model outputs. The logistic regression model
   performed better than the socioeconomic model in capturing the pattern
   and location of deforestation over time. Differences in clearing
   patterns in both models were attributed to local topography, farming
   obstacles, and stochastic elements of farming. Results of this study
   help demonstrate some of the advantages in the use of integrated
   socioeconomic/ecological models for predicting land-use change and will
   hopefully facilitate the development of integrated models that
   accurately simulate the processes of land clearing on a regional and
   global scale..}},

Abstract = {{Multispectral airborne remote sensing was used to improve the inventory
   of soil heterogeneity at the sub-field level. A bioindicative model was
   developed, based on cause and effect relationships of the
   soil-plant-sensor system. The spectral information was transformed into
   soil information using bioindicative transfer functions. This procedure
   enables quantitatively the spatial detection of the limiting soil
   quality e.g. the plant available water capacity of the root zone. Remote
   sensing based maps as developed in this study will support farmers and
   agricultural advisors to practice precision farming using site-specific

Abstract = {{The dimishing yield of crop varieties after they have been under
   continuous cultivation for a number of years is a common feature of many
   crops including sugarcane. This paper reviews the yield productivity
   plateau in the South African sugar industry with reference to soil
   quality. The preliminary results of a three-phase approach based on
   defining the extent of the yield plateau phenomenon, changes in soil
   quality under continuous cropping and solutions for breaking the effects
   of sugarcane monoculture are discussed. Apart from a yield productivity
   plateau developed in the industry since 1971, it is evident that
   continuous I cropping with sugarcane has adversely affected soil
   productivity. Both paired site investigations and long term burnt cane
   harvesting trial results have shown increased soil acidification, loss
   of soil organic matter and an imbalance in soil biota under continuous
   cropping. Research has shown that practices such as greencane
   harvesting, green manuring and incorporation of organic residues through
   vertical mulching can arrest the soil degradation process and increase
   sugarcane yields by promoting a build up of labile carbon and general
   improvement in physical, chemical and biological properties of soils.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality models developed for ecodistrict polygons (EDP) and the
   polygons of the soil landscapes of Canada (SLC) to monitor the
   concentration of soil organic matter require daily climate data as an
   important input. The objectives of this paper are (i) to provide a
   method that interpolates the daily station data onto the 894 SLC
   polygons and 150 EDP in the province of Alberta, Canada, so that the
   interpolated data fit not only climate mean but also climate
   variability, especially for the precipitation field, and hence can be
   used as realistic climate input to soil quality models and (ii) to
   understand the variability of the Alberta daily climate, such as
   precipitation frequency. The procedure interpolates the station data
   onto a dense network of grid points and then averages the gridpoint
   values inside polygons. The procedure and results for maximum
   temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation are reported in
   detail. The interpolation uses the observed daily data for the period 1
   January 1961-31 December 1997 (13 514 days) within the
   latitude-longitude box (45 degrees -64 degreesN, 116 degrees -124
   degreesW). Because the precipitation field can have a short spatial
   correlation length scale and large variability, a hybrid of the methods
   of inverse-distance weight and nearest-station assignment is developed
   for interpolating the precipitation data. This method can reliably
   calculate not only the number of precipitation days per month, but also
   the precipitation amount for a day. The temperature field has a long
   spatial correlation scale, and its data are interpolated by the
   inverse-distance-weight method. Cross-validation shows that the
   interpolated results on polygons are accurate and appropriate for soil
   quality models. The computing algorithm uses all the daily observed
   climate data; despite that, some stations have a very short time record
   or only summer records.}},

Abstract = {{The prospect of using wastewater containing high loads of soluble
   organic matter (OM) for removing residual agricultural chemicals
   (fertilizer, pesticide, or herbicide) in farm soil, although promising,
   could have adverse effects on soil agricultural quality as a result of
   development of redoximorphic features in the soil profile. In this
   study, the effect of organic carbon supplement for bioremediation of
   residual fertilizer nitrate on soil properties, redox potential (Eh),
   pH, and metal ion mobilization was studied using sandy soils packed in
   columns. The study was included in a general project, described
   elsewhere (Ugwuegbu et al., 2000), undertaken to evaluate use of
   controlled water table management (WTM) systems to supply organic carbon
   for creating a reduced environment conducive to denitrification of
   residual fertilizer nitrate leaching from the farm to subsurface water.
   The columns were subjected to subirrigation with water containing
   soluble organic carbon in the form of glucose, The work was carried out
   in two experimental setups and the long-term effect of a range of
   glucose concentrations on the Eh, pH, and soluble levels of Fe and Mn
   was investigated. From the results obtained, it could be concluded that
   excessive organic carbon supplement to soil can have adverse effects on
   soil quality and that Eh and soluble Fe are the two most practical
   parameters for monitoring soil health during treatment of farm
   chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{The biological health of soil is an important aspect of soil quality
   because of the many critical functions performed by organisms in soil.
   Various indicators of soil quality have been proposed, but measurements
   of microbial biomass are most commonly used. During decomposition of
   plant residues in soil the relative intensities of the O-alkyl-C signal
   decreases and the alkyl-C signal increases in nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) spectra This leads to the suggestion that the alkyl-C to O-alkyl-C
   ratio of a soil may indicate the degree of decomposition. Consequently,
   the overall resource quality of soil C as a substrate for heterotrophic
   microorganisms may be inversely related to the alkyl-C to O-alkyl-C
   ratio. Our hypothesis is that a relationship exists between the size of
   the soil microbial community (microbial biomass) and the quality of soil
   carbon as a resource for microorganisms. New data have been combined
   with previously published data to show that there was a significant,
   negative correlation between the biomass C to total C (C-mic to C-org)
   ratio and the alkyl-C to O-alkyl-C ratio (p < 0.01), which supports our
   hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, manure has been recognized as an excellent soil amendment
   that can improve soil quality and provide nutrients for crop production.
   In areas of high animal density, however, the potential for water
   pollution resulting from improper storage or disposal of manure may be
   significant. The objective of this study was to determine the P balance
   of cultivated soils under barley (Hordeum vulgare L,) production that
   have received long-term annual manure amendments, Nonirrigated soils at
   the study site in Lethbridge,AB, Canada, have received 0, 30, 60, or 90
   Mg manure ha(-1) (wet wt, basis) while irrigated plots received 0, 60,
   120, and 180 Mg ha(-1) annually for 16 yr, The amount of P removed in
   barley grain and straw during the 16-yr period was between 5 and 18\% of
   the cumulative manure P applied. There was a balance between P applied
   in manure and P recovered in crops and soils (to the 150-cm depth) of
   nonirrigated plots during the 16-yr study. In irrigated plots, as much
   as 1.4 Mg P ha(-1) added (180 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) treatment) was not
   recovered over 16 yr, and was probably lost through leaching, The risk
   of ground water contamination with P from manure was greater in
   irrigated than nonirrigated plots that have received long-term annual
   manure amendments, Manure application rates should be reduced in
   nonirrigated and irrigated plots to more closely match manure P inputs
   to crop P requirements.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of management practices associated with livestock grazing on
   soil properties are largely unknown. Several physical, chemical and
   biological soil properties were compared for soil from a native
   vegetation exclosure, a moderately grazed native vegetation pasture
   stocked at 2.6 ha (6.4 ac) steer(-1), a heavily grazed native vegetation
   pasture stocked at 0.9 ha steer(-1), and and a fertilized crested
   wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum L. Gaertn.) pasture stocked at 0.9 ha
   steer(-1) near Mandan, North Dakota. The three native vegetation
   pastures were established in 1916 and the crested wheatgrass pasture was
   seeded in 1932. Soil properties varied in sensitivity to the management
   practices. Measures of vegetation and animal production, combined with
   assessment of soil properties suggest that moderate grazing and
   fertilization of crested wheatgrass are viable management options that
   appear to be sustainable while providing good and services needed by
   society. Range and pasture assessment should include soil assessment to
   more completely determine management effects on pastoral ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The estimated properties for soil survey map units typically are only
   for major soil use. Users are provided only one set of soil properties.
   We consider the combination of use-invariant and use-dependent databases
   to produce composite records. The use-invariant data is determined by
   soil origin and genesis and is dt most only slightly subject to change
   with use. The use-dependent data is readily subject to change by use.
   Near-surface properties are particularly subject to change with use.
   Each use-invariant property assigned a surficial exclusion zone within
   which the property considered use-dependent and hence the standard
   interpretive record is not applicable. Both use-dependent and
   use-invariant properties are placed in one of five classes. Numerical
   rankings for quality evaluation are obtained by combining the placements
   for the several properties concerned.}},

Abstract = {{Tillage and fallow have been suggested as management options for
   converting Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) areas to cropland This
   study was conducted to measure selected soil quality characteristics of
   former CRP sites in Mississippi, Nebraska, and South Dakota that were
   tilled and then left fallow for 21 or 22 months. Soil samples from depth
   intervals of 0-7.6 cm and 0-30.5 cm were collected for laboratory
   assessment of the following soil quality indicators: bulk density, EC,
   pH, total C, organic C, total N NO3-N, NH4-N, PO4-P, biomass C, biomass
   N, anaerobic NH4-N, lab respiration 0-10 days and lab respiration 10-20
   days. When compared to undisturbed CRP, increased NO3-N values on the
   tillage and fallow plots suggest that under the extreme renditions
   employed in this study, organic residues were being mineralized. Re a
   result, significant reductions in organic C and total N were found at
   the 0-7.6 cm depth on each of the fallow plots. Thus, to reduce soil
   quality degradation, use of minimum-till or no-till management systems
   may be best suited for CRP areas which are converted to cropland.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated soil chemical and physical properties as affected
   by timber harvesting and cattle grazing on cutblocks planted to
   lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.).
   Soil conditions on the ungrazed exclosures (representing disturbance by
   harvest only) and pastures grazed over 10 years to achieve 50\% forage
   utilization (representing disturbance by harvest and grazing) were
   compared to the nearly forest without harvest and cattle grazing. Soil
   chemical properties showed no detrimental impacts from harvesting and/or
   livestock grazing. In fact, greater CEC, Ca, C, and N values on
   disturbance treatments should improve these soils as rooting media. Soil
   physical properties, although less favorable for tree growth on the two
   disturbance treatments than the mature forest, showed that a majority of
   the soil profile was not compacted above root-restricting threshold
   conditions. Results obtained from this study support the integrated use
   of forested rangelands in southern British Columbia.}},

Abstract = {{Producers in the semiarid Canadian prairies have begun to extend and
   diversify their cropping systems. These newer cropping systems are often
   considered to be more sustainable. We examine the agronomic,
   environmental, and economic effects of reducing summer fallow use and
   including grain lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) in rotation with spring
   wheat(Triticum aestivum L.). Data from a long-term crop rotation
   experiment conducted on a medium texture soil at Swift Current,
   Saskatchewan were analyzed. Four cropping systems were evaluated over
   the 1979 to 1997 period; namely, fallow-wheat (F-W), fallow-wheat-wheat
   (F-W-W), continuous wheat (W), and wheat-lentil(W-l). Nitrate leaching
   below the 120 cm rooting depth of wheat was lower under continuously
   cropped systems than under fellow-based rotations, and was lowest
   overall for W-L. Wheat, whether grown on fallow or stubble, used almost
   all of the available water in the 0-120 cm depth soil profile, but
   lentil extracted about 1.5 cm less water than wheat. On average, wheat
   yield was unaffected by inclusion of lentil in the rotation; however,
   grain protein content was higher in 11 of 18 years. The incidence of
   leaf spotting diseases in wheat was lowest for wheal grown after lentil
   and highest for wheat grown on Fallow. Soil quality (soil organic
   carbon, mineralizable N and C, light fraction organic C, and water
   stable aggregates) increased with cropping intensity in the order of W-L
   greater than or equal to W > F-W-W > F-W. Although inputs of
   non-renewable energy and CO2 emissions were higher Ibr the continuous
   compared to fallow-based rotations, including lentil in the rotation
   lowered the energy requirements for N fertilizer and provided an overall
   19\%, reduction in CO2 emissions. The economics favored the W-L system
   whenever lentil price was above \$350 t(-1). The level of financial risk
   was lowest for F-W and F-W-W, intermediate for W-L. and highest for W.
   Our findings confirm the recent changes in land use practices being
   adopted by producers, and clearly show that extending and diversifying
   crop rotations by reducing fallow and including pulse crops in the
   rotation will improve the overall sustainability of agricultural
   production in this semiarid region. (C) 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Abstract = {{Tropical forests of the world are degrading at an alarming rate because
   of human-induced activities. This study was conducted to determine the
   consequences of deforestation on the natural regeneration of vegetation
   and soil quality in tropical, semi-evergreen protected and degraded
   forest ecosystems of Bangladesh. In each forest ecosystem, 20 matured
   trees were randomly selected for laid-out experimental pints by placing
   the tree stand at the center of the plot. The number of vegetative
   species, height, basal area, crown percentages and species richness were
   measured. The selected soil properties were determined. The vegetation
   in the protected forest site was denser with an abundance of species
   than in the degraded forest site. The primary forest regenerative
   species were dominated by the dipterocarps in both forest sites. The
   most alarming difference was that of an abrupt decline in regenerative
   forest species accompanied by an increase in exotic shrubs, grasses and
   vines typical of open habitats in the degraded forest site. These shrubs
   (e.g. Melastaoma, Lantana camara, Clerodendrum infortunatum and
   Jasminium spp.) and grasses and vines (e.g. Imperata cylindrica,
   Imperata arundinacea, Mikania scandenes, Saccharum spontaneum and
   Eupatorium odoratum) are gradually replacing the primary forest
   regenerative species in the degraded forest site. The soil quality of
   the degraded forest site has deteriorated over time due to preferential
   removal of finer particles and organic matter by accelerated water
   erosion. As a result, natural regeneration of primary forest species,
   especially dipterocarps, is severely affected by the direct effects of
   biotic interferences and attendant processes of soil quality degradation
   from deforestation. In contrast, degraded forest sites under regular
   protection have shown slow, but gradual, increase in crown frequency,
   enhanced recruitment and recovery of primary forest species, species
   abundance, and an improvement in soil quality. Copyright (C) 2001 John

Abstract = {{In order to study influence of deep ploughing and crop rotation on crops
   yield and soil properties two long-term experiments were in Priekuli
   Plant Breeding Station established. Soil at the site was drained soddy
   podzolic loam with the following characteristics: organic matter
   content: 1.5-2.1 \%, pH (KCl): 5.5-5.8, P2O5 and -K2O content 15-20 and
   7-10 mg per 100 g soil respectively.
   These studies show that gradually deepening of topsoil till 0.25-0.27 m
   and reversing through of then advantaged the increasing of crop yield
   but the increasing of yields level is comparatively small. The main
   importance of deep ploughing is for increasing of soil microbial
   activity. Gradually deepening of topsoil must be managed only every 5
   year. The best results are after reversing of topsoil of clover +
   timothy field before seeding of cereals acquired.
   The influence of crop rotations on soil properties most sharp find
   expression in fertilizations systems without organic fertilizing. In 40
   years period changes of organic matter content in fertilizer variant
   with stable manure are insignificant.}},

Abstract = {{Increased demand for land is forcing many farmers to intensify their
   upland rice-based systems with a gradual shift from bush fallow rotation
   towards sedentary agricultural production. However, farmers are not
   adapting appropriate management practices to the intensified land use,
   which may threaten sustainability. Diagnostic field trials were
   conducted at four sites in during 1994 and 1997, comparing 228 farmers'
   fields with diverse cropping histories. The objective was to improve
   future research priority setting and to guide site and systems-specific
   targeting of available technical options. Soil samples (0-20 ) were
   analyzed for pH, organic matter quantity and quality, and the potential
   soil N supplying capacity. Weed species and dry biomass and rice grain
   yield were determined under farmers' management and in three
   super-imposed researcher-managed subplots (hand weeding at 28, 56, and
   84 days, 30 mineral fertilizer N application, and a combination of
   both). Yield gaps were attributed to weeds and nitrogen, based on yield
   response to researchers' management in intensified systems. Increased
   cropping intensity and reduced fallow duration were associated with
   yield reduction, which was largest at the sites in the derived savanna
   (1.48 vs. 1.15 ) and the bimodal forest zones (1.55 vs. 1.02 ).
   Intensification-induced yield loss was about 25\% and appeared to be
   related mainly to increased weed infestation (72\% more weed biomass)
   and declining soil quality (about 20\% less soil organic C content and N
   supply). Weeds were the dominant factor responsible for rice yield loss
   in the forest area (explaining 65\% of the yield gap) and appeared to
   play a lesser role in the savanna. The reduction in soil organic carbon
   and N supplying capacity was strongest in the derived savanna zone where
   N supply explained 35\% of the yield gap. In the two savanna
   environments, a large share of the intensifiaction-related yield
   reduction could not be ascribed to either weeds or N (probably related
   to changes in soil physical parameters or pests). Long-term upland rice
   productivity can thus not be sustained at current intensification
   practices. Improved management strategies should aim primarily at
   reducing weed pressure and improving soil organic matter content and N
   supply. Technical options are likely to vary with agro-ecological zones.}},

Abstract = {{We measured the effect of a typical soil-feeding termite on soil quality
   using experimental mesocosms. We obtained soil from five different sites
   in the humid forest zone of southern Cameroon. The sites were along a
   disturbance gradient, from near primary, to highly degraded agricultural
   soil. We allowed colonies of Cubitermes fungifaber to work the soils for
   13 days. We measured physical and chemical parameters in the worked
   soils that are known to be important in soil quality, and therefore to
   influence fertility. We found that C. fungifaber raised pH in soils with
   an initial low pH, increased organic carbon, water content and relative
   amount of kaolinite, and decreased the relative amount of quartz. The
   main effect of these termites is to raise local microsite soil quality,
   and these effects are greatest in the near primary and old secondary
   forests. Termites are, therefore, potentially important sources of
   heterogeneity in tropical forest soil systems.}},

Abstract = {{The vulnerability of small islands to invasion by non-native species is
   well known and is almost invariably seen as an undesirable trend that
   must be resisted and ideally reversed. However many islands are heavily
   modified systems where: the environmental conditions have changed, and
   where new demands are made on the biota. St Helena has undergone massive
   environmental degeneration and change and provides an example where new
   colonising species are both inevitable and sometimes beneficial. A
   review of the major colonists shows that many may lead to recovery of
   landuse functions or soil quality. The difficulties involved in control
   are also apparent. Alien status and a tendency for invasiveness are not
   in themselves adequate criteria for defining problem species in such a
   damaged system where revegetation is a priority. Throughout the world
   plant distribution changes will increasingly reflect environmental
   change and degradation rather than being causal agents of such
   degradation. More focused functional criteria are needed to identify
   where control measures must be targetted.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive use of mineral fertilisers can result in economic and
   environmental penalties. Alternatively organic wastes can be recycled to
   provide a source of plant nutrients, especially N, as well as enhancing
   future crop production by improving soil quality. An incubation
   experiment was carried out using different wastes: municipal solid
   wastes (MSW), poultry manure (PM) and horn meal (HM), and a Cambic
   arenosol soil. Incorporation of the wastes always led to an increase of
   potentially available N in the soil/residue mixture. Mineralisation
   rates were higher when residues were incorporated into the soil,
   compared to soil organic matter alone. A pot experiment was set up with
   a 1:1 mixture of Chernozeme soil and quartz sand, using ryegrass (Lolium
   perene L.) and potato (Solanum tuberosa L.) as test crops. The
   fertilising values of MSW, PM and HM were compared with a range of
   mineral nitrogen fertiliser rates (0.0, 0.5, 1 and 2 g N/pot). Residues
   tested on ryegrass had similar effects on growth as the application of
   0.5 g N. Plants grown with 1 and 2 g N produced higher total yields,
   although on the first cut the dry matter obtained was lower. HM seemed
   to be more efficient than other residues in terms of growth and uptake
   of N by both species tested.}},

Abstract = {{In laboratory scale experiments using a microcosm thermally contained
   system, hydrogen peroxide exerted a triggering effect on the composting
   process. Upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide the temperature in the
   composting mass increased at a significantly faster rate than in the
   control. Similar triggering effects were observed in all cases of
   compostable materials examined. Among these were: immature orujo
   compost, orujo co-composted with alpechin, cotton gin trash alone or
   mixed with olive pulp (de-stoned by centrifugation fraction of de-oiled
   alpeorujo); mushroom straw compost; and spent mushroom compost.
   Compost quality is an intricate topic and its precise definition is
   often controversial. In general terms compost quality is the summation
   of the numerous characteristics of compost that are recognised to play a
   role in sustaining soil quality and contributing to plant health and
   yield. Although there may be disagreements on quantitative measures,
   this definition implies response of a soil ecosystem including its plant
   constituents to a particular compost treatment. This definition makes
   sense only if it is used in reference to a particular compost attribute
   and type of application. Moreover, most agree that important
   characteristics of compost, such as suppressiveness against soil borne
   root pathogens, are closely linked to the composting process.
   The observed triggering effect of hydrogen peroxide on composts can be
   successfully exploited for the assessment of an important aspect of
   compost quality, i.e. its stability, through the development of a more
   sensitive modification of the self-heating test.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion of primary forest to pasture is widespread in Central and
   Latin America and the progressive removal of trees has resulted in
   environmental degradation and a decline in productivity, simultaneously
   threatening rural livelihoods and regional biodiversity. Recently there
   has been keen interest to develop silvipastoral systems for sustainable
   animal production. Traditional silvipastoral systems are characterised
   with a diversity of woody perennials that plays an important role in
   supplying feed to animals in the dry season, production of timber, shade
   for animals, and in the conservation of natural resources. Improved
   novel woody perennials such as Morris alba (mulberry) and Trichanthera
   gigantea (nacedero) are characterised by high nutritive value and the
   use of these species as supplements for dairy and beef cattle resulted
   in significant improvements in animal production. Studies on tree/grass
   silvipastoral systems showed that the use of multi-purpose trees such as
   Acacia mangium contributed to higher yields (> 30\%) of the associated
   grass and in improvements in soil quality. These silvipastoral systems
   have been shown to sequester significant amounts of carbon (7 to 16
   tons/ha/yr) and they contribute in conservation of water resources and
   biodiversity. It is concluded that traditional systems are characterised
   with a diversity of woody perennials that have a significant value for
   improving animal productivity, and for the conservation of natural
   resources. Novel non-leguminous woody perennials are of high nutritive
   value and has a great potential for substituting the use of concentrates
   in dairy and beef farming. The selection and management of improved
   grasses and the management of woody perennials in silvipastoral systems
   can contribute in increased carrying capacities of pastures and thereby
   liberating fragile lands under grazing for re-afforestation.}},

Abstract = {{The multiple benefits of perennial agriculture, including forages and
   grasslands, for building soil quality, protection of natural resources,
   enhancement of biodiversity and wildlife, are well known to us, but
   little understood by the public. This is not a situation where ``more
   education{''} would necessarily increase recognition. Rather, we must
   build in the public a desire for the enhancement of green space, clean
   water and air, and diverse landscapes that multiple purpose agriculture
   can bring. We seek such environments intuitively and now that much of
   the world's people are ``trapped{''} in urban settings of steel and
   concrete, this desire is even more apparent.
   Yet other forces continually work against using agriculture for such
   uses. Economic motives are at the base of the conflict. Grasslands
   seldom produce recognizable returns. It is important for grassland
   scientists to bring to the public forum the benefits of their unique
   approach, even while the agricultural world seems to be moving toward a
   grain-based economy. Such recognition is necessary if public support of
   conservation incentives are to become a part of agriculture. Rotational
   grazing offers one way around the economic issue, and will be discussed
   in detail. Other economic approaches involve government leasing and
   government recognition of environmental benefits (Conservation Reserve
   Program).
   A concept gaining support involves carbon trading. This is payment to
   the land owner by public or private entities for conservation practices
   that sequester carbon, thereby reducing the carbon dioxide load in the
   atmosphere and slowing global climate change. Carbon trading could
   ultimately be endorsed in the Kyoto treaty, making carbon sequestration
   a part of national policies and a new way to support multifuctional
   agriculture.
   The paper will discuss pros and cons of several management options that
   will require the use of perennial crops, grasslands in particular. Ways
   are also discussed to engage the public in the decision making process.
   The bottom line, however, is that in some way or the other grasslands
   systems often must be subsidized in the United States.}},

Abstract = {{Many trails in the Brazilian National Parks system have been closed due
   to the impact caused by increasing and continuous use. Some of the
   trails will take a long time to recover, and some may even show worse
   conditions after a few years. The ability to choose the best strategy to
   restore vegetation and soil quality will help managers save scarce
   financial resources that can then be used in other conservation actions.
   A seedbank test, together with soil analysis, seems to be helpful in
   this task. Most currently used management actions are not specific to
   different sites on the same trail. In this study, results of a seedbank
   test showed the sites that recovered best were those with soils
   containing a high concentration of organic material and nutrients.
   Sometimes only the presence of organic material was enough to enable
   recovery, showing that fertilization is not always necessary. We also
   identified areas where more active restoration was needed, including
   soil transplanting. Considering all the results, we were able to
   recommend the best management strategy for each site, and which we
   expect to achieve the best results in trail recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated aquaculture-agriculture production systems were developed
   primarily for sustainable food production in rural areas of South
   Africa. The problem of environmental pollution was addressed by
   utilizing the nutrients in the agricultural waste products to fertilize
   the fish ponds, thus stimulating pond productivity and releasing
   nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus into irrigation water for
   vegetable crop production. Due to problems encountered with soil quality
   as a result of the build-up of nutrients due to chemical fertilizers and
   the excessive use of pesticides, it was decided to implement EM
   technology to restore the organic and micro-biological balances of the
   cultivated lands. Three vegetable crops, namely cabbage, spinach and
   lettuce, were cultivated under different irrigation systems, using EM,
   organic compost and inorganic chemical fertilizing programmes. After the
   first application of EM Bokashi, significant improvements in vegetable
   yields were recorded. EM treated plots proved to be superior in the
   yields of cabbage and lettuce clearly exceeding the agricultural average
   for South Africa. In the case of spinach, EM treated plots under drip
   irrigation proved to be the most productive. Application of irrigation
   water as well as soil quality, appeared to be two factors that must be
   considered when ascertaining the amount of EM to be applied to further
   improve yields following organic fanning. Recommendations are made to
   evaluate the health status of EM treated soils.}},

Abstract = {{A cooperative research study was conducted by Chinese agricultural
   institutions and the International Nature Farming Center, Nagano, Japan
   to evaluate the effect of EM technology on organic recycling, soil
   quality, crop yield and quality, and environmental protection. In the
   studs,, EM was mixed with farmyard manure (FYM) and sometimes with
   poultry manure and fermented prior to application to soil and crops.
   Compared with traditional FYM (alone) and chemical fertilizer the
   EM+FYAT treatments 1) increased total soil microbial biomass,- 2)
   improved certain soil physical properties (i.e decreased soil bulk
   density) and chemical properties (i.e. increased soil cation exchange
   capacity); 3) increased soil organic matter content; 4) increased the
   level and plant availability or macronutrients (N-P-K); and 5) increased
   crude protein content of harvested corn. The grain yields of wheat and
   corn from the EM+FYM treatment were consistently 10 percent to 20
   percent higher over a three-year period compared with FYM alone and
   chemical alone.}},

Abstract = {{The groundwater in the Indus basin contributes around 35 percent of the
   total water available for agriculture on 17 million hectares. Water
   quality of 60 percent area of the basin is marginal to brackish in
   quality. The use of sodic or saline-sodic groundwater contributed to
   secondary sodification. Therefore, farmers have to use gypsum as an
   amendment, which has very low solubility, and thus its use is not cost
   effective without public sector subsidy. The Sulfurous Generator
   technology requires high initial investment of around US\$ 25,000 with
   higher operational cost. The research studies were conducted to design
   and build a EM Bio-generator with initial investment of US\$ 300-400 for
   a farm size of 10 hectares. The propagability of EM is extremely high
   mid EM 1 can be extended in three phases using ratio of 1:1:20
   (EM:Molasses:Water). Therefore, one litre of EM 1 can be extended in
   three phases to 22,484 mid 10648 litres of adended-EM, siper-extended EM
   and supra-extended EM, respectively A pH of 4.0 can be achieved after 34
   days of detention. After the first cycle, the whole process can be
   completed in 3 days in summer and 7-8 days in winter seas on. The
   supra-extended EM was used to amend sodic groundwater using a ratio of
   1:100 (EM:Water) which reduced one unit of pH i.e. from 9.5 to 8.5 and
   reaction was stable for 44 days with further reduction in pH. The
   amended water will further help to manage the sodic soil. In fact, the
   acid forming character of EM is very encouraging because improvements in
   soil productivity would be an added benefit in addition to amending
   sodic water The techno-economic analysis indicated that once the
   microbial mass is built in the soil, much less EM will be required to
   amend the sodic water Comparative studies of EM with other traditional
   amendments like gypsum and sulfuric acid were conducted. The initial
   results indicated that low solubility of gypsum is a major limitation in
   having chemical reaction in soil because of heavy depths of water
   required for leaching. The waterlogging problem, scarce water resources
   and high pumping cost do not permit farmers to use additional amounts of
   freshwater for leaching. Apparently, the EM amended water would not
   require extra leaching because monsoon rains can provide leaching.
   Furthermore, gypsum also add salts in soils which are already high in
   salinity, whereas total solids of EM are all organic based and thus
   would not add much towards salinity of soil. Lysimeter studies reveal
   that by lowering down one unit of pH of sodic water through addition of
   Supra-extended EX, there was 70.54 percent decrease in soil SAR build
   zip as compared to control (29.9 percent). The potential of EM
   Bio-generator is immense especially for semi-arid and and environments
   where calcareous soils having pH of 8.0 or more are very common. The
   acidic nature of EM would be a blessing for future agriculture using
   marginal groundwater and still soil quality can be managed on
   sustainable basis. Although, there is a resistance from traditional
   scientists in accepting the technology farmers have already started
   using it at their own cost in an environment where almost every
   intervention including chemical fertilizers were introduced with a
   subsidy from the government. This is the encouraging aspect of the
   Bio-generator in Pakistan. Future research would be directed towards
   integrated systems including biogas and amending saline groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of soil C sequestration in managed and natural forest
   ecosystems is not recognized because of the lack of readily available
   research information on magnitude and rate of soil C sequestration. The
   perception that soil C sequestration is not important vis-A-vis the
   amount of C sequestered in the above-ground biomass is not supported by
   the published experimental data from different ecoregions. The soil
   organic carbon (SOC) pool in forest ecosystems can be equal to or more
   than that in the above-ground biomass. The rate of soil C sequestration
   due to change in land use from agricultural to natural or managed forest
   ecosystems depends on antecedent soil quality and ecoregional
   characteristics. Similar to cropland, the rate of C sequestration in
   forest soils also can be limited by nutrient deficiency and elemental
   toxicity. Lack of N availability can curtail the biomass productivity
   and conversion of litter and root biomass to humus. Alleviation of
   drought and optimization of soil-water availability can enhance C
   sequestration in forest soil also. Depending on soil and ecoregional
   factors, the magnitude of soil C sequestration can be 20 to 50 Mg C
   ha(-1). The rate of C sequestration is either low or even negative in
   the first 3 to 5 yr, rising to the maximum level within 10 to 15 yr, and
   eventually declining to a zero when soil is in equilibrium with the
   vegetation. The mean rate of soil C sequestration over 40- to 50-yr
   period may be 0.5 to 1 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). The potential of soil C
   sequestration through afforestation is more in,degraded soils where the
   needed inputs are applied to achieve the desired level of productivity.
   Restoration of degraded soils at the global scale has a potential to
   sequester up to 3 Pg C yr(-1) in soil and biomass, and arrest the rate
   of increase in atmospheric concentration of CO(2).}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality spatial variability has a direct implication on soil
   productivity. One of the main variables responsible for soil quality
   variability in agricultural fields is soil erosion.
   Several authors have shown that in agricultural lands there exists a net
   down slope soil transportation due to several erosion processes as
   water, tillage, wind, etc. In a long-term analysis, soil erosion will
   reduce soil depth profile and this type of phenomena will have
   consequences on soil productivity. The objective of this study is to
   evaluate the spatial variability of soil productivity and to what extent
   this variability is due to soil erosion.
   For the studied site the hay production on the concavities was
   approximately 2.5 times higher than in the convexities and the
   experimental evidence suggests that tillage and water erosion has some
   responsibility on this topographically dependent, production.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal Plain soils located in the southeastern U.S. have been
   intensively cropped and traditionally managed under conventional tillage
   practices. They are susceptible to erosion, resulting in transport of
   pollutants to off-site water supplies through colloidal facilitated
   transport of agrichemicals. The objective of this study was to quantify
   rainfall partitioning, sediment delivery and characterization, and
   enrichment of clays between sediments and in situ soils from a Typic
   Hapludult loamy sand managed under conventional-till (CT), no-till (NT),
   and para-till systems. Plots (1 m(2)) established on each tillage system
   treatment were exposed to simulated rainfall for 2 h with an intensity
   of 50 nun h(-1). Runoff and sediment delivery were continuously measured
   from flat, level-sloping field plots (slope-1\%). More runoff (45\% vs.
   72\%) and sediment losses Q fold) occurred from CT plots compared to NT
   plots, Removing residue from NT and CT plots increased runoff (38-48\%)
   and sediment (2-5 fold) losses compared to corresponding plots with
   residue. Para-tilling decreased runoff (by up to 50\%) and sediment (2
   fold) losses compared to non-para-tilled plots. Amount of water
   dispersible clay (WDC) was correlated with \%OC (W=0.76), which was a
   function of tillage treatment. Sediments were enriched in quartz and
   depleted with respect to kaolinite as compared to in situ soils.}},

Abstract = {{Over winter flash floods cause erosive activities in the basins and
   adjacent agricultural areas in the semi-arid parts of the Negev Desert
   of Israel. This has led to the formation of waterfalls (gullies) that
   erode streams. Consequently, this has caused the loss of soil nutrients
   over time. Soil erosion in conjunction with human activities has greatly
   contributed to desertification in this part of the Negev. We set out to
   examine the effects of soil erosion and agricultural practices in
   seventeen eroded sites in northern Negev Desert. Organic carbon
   increased along a moisture gradient, being lowest in areas receiving 200
   mm and highest where rainfall is over 300 nun per year. Nature reserves
   had higher organic carbon than cultivated areas. Salinity was highest in
   the nature reserve sites and irrigated areas because of accumulation of
   bases resulting from reduced leaching and continuous supplies of heavy
   metals from brackish water used in the irrigation system, respectively.
   Water holding capacity was higher in nature reserve soils than in
   cultivated areas, whereas eroded sites contained bigger soil particles
   than uneroded ones.}},

Abstract = {{To compare the effectiveness of different pasture species in restoring
   soil quality, changes in concentration and quality of soil organic
   carbon (C) were measured in the surface 10 cm of an Oxic Paleustalf (red
   earth) in the semiarid area of New South Wales, Australia, at the end of
   4 years under lucerne (Medicago sativa cv. Trifecta), Consol lovegrass
   (Eragrostis curvula), and barrel medic (Medicago truncutulata cv sephi).
   Before the investigation, the soil had been degraded by 50 years of
   cropping, Soil samples were analyzed for water stable aggregation,
   mineralizable N, and C by three procedures: Total carbon (C) by dry
   combustion, oxidizible C by potassium permanganate, and oxidizible C by
   potassium dichromate/sulphuric acid with varying concentrations of acid,
   Higher dry matter production caused lucerne to be was more effective
   than barrel medic in increasing soil organic carbon concentration.
   Compared with fallow plots, total soil organic carbon concentration
   increased by 1.6, 26, and 11\%, respectively, in the Consol lovegrass,
   lucerne, and barrel medic treatments. Nevertheless, even in the case of
   lucerne, the 26\% increase in organic carbon in the 0-10-cm layer at the
   end of 4 years (7.87 vs. 9.88 g/kg) represented only 15\% of the total
   loss in organic carbon after 50 years of cropping.
   Most (78-92\%) of the organic carbon increases under the various
   pastures were of the more labile forms, as indicated by their removal
   under much milder oxidizing conditions than those recommended in the
   standard methods for organic carbon determination. Significant
   improvements in structural stability and nitrogen availability were
   detected in the perennial pasture soils. Our results suggested that the
   amount of organic carbon oxidizible by a modified Walkley-Black method,
   which involves using only half the amount of sulphuric acid, is a more
   sensitive indicator of the improvement in soil quality parameters under
   investigation, namely increases ill mineralizable nitrogen and water
   stable aggregation. Further research is needed to verify these findings
   over a range of soil types and agroecosystems.}},

   level of contamination and the contribution of traffic density. Levels
   of Pb, Zn, Cd, and Cu were elevated above background concentrations
   measured in control areas. Average values (ppm) for all sample locations
   were Pb - 81 +/- 140; Zn - 48 +/- 37; Cd - 0.55 +/- 0.49; Cu - 17 +/-
   17, Cr 22.1 +/- 9.6; Co - 7.9 +/-. 3.8; Ni- 10.5 +/- 9.7. Factors of
   accumulation of metals in roadsides relative to control sites were
   highest for Pb. Vehicular traffic was not an important source of
   chromium, cobalt and nickel, for which roadside concentrations were
   about those of the control sites. Metal concentrations were poorly
   correlated with traffic volumes. An average of about 60\% of total soil
   concentration of the metals were determined to be held in bioavailable
   geochemical phases, of which the highest concentrations were mostly held
   in either the reducible or oxidizable phase. Levels of the metals in the
   topsoil were generally lower than the soil quality criteria of some

Abstract = {{Wheat production in Morocco is constrained by both scarce climate and
   degraded soil quality. There is an urgent need to revert production
   decline while restoring country's soils. Among conservation tillage
   systems known for their improvement in yield, no-till technology was
   found to influence soil quality as well. Soil quality indices are also
   affected by wheat rotations at medium and long-terms. This paper
   discusses changes in selected properties of a Calcixeroll soil,
   including total and particulate soil organic matter (SOM), pH, total N
   and aggregation, subjected, for 11 consecutive years, to various
   conservation and conventional agricultural systems. Tillage systems
   included no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT). Crop rotations
   were continuous wheat, fallow-wheat, fallow-wheat-com,
   fallow-wheat-forage and fallow-wheat-lentils. Higher aggregation, carbon
   sequestration, pH decline and particulate organic matter (POM) buildup
   are major changes associated with shift from conventional- to NT system.
   Better stability of aggregates was demonstrated by a significantly
   greater mean weight diameter under NT (3.8 mm) than CT system (3.2 mm)
   at the soil surface. There was 13.6\% SOC increase in (0-200 mm) over
   the 11-year period under NT, while CT did not affect much this soil
   quality indicator. Another valuable funding is the stratification of SOC
   and total nitrogen in NT surface horizon (0-25 mm) without their
   depletion at deeper horizon compared to tillage treatments. Fallow-wheat
   system resulted in reduction of SOC compared to WW, but 3-year wheat
   rotation tended to improve overall soil quality. Benefits from crop
   rotation in terms of organic carbon varied between 2.6 and 11.7\%, with
   fallow-wheat-forage exhibiting the maximum. Combined use of NT and
   3-year fallow rotation helped to improve soil quality in this
   experiment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The beneficial use of drinking water treatment residuals, (WTRs) as a
   potential source of topsoil for land reclamation was evaluated.
   Seventeen WTRs were characterized for use as soil substitutes by
   comparing chemical and physical properties and plant nutrients of the
   WTRs with soil. A tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) bioassay was
   performed to determine the ability. of soil chemical tests to measure
   WTR phosphorus (P) adequacy. The WTR chemical and physical properties
   were typically adequate for crop, growth. None of the WTRs were
   considered unsuitable as soil substitutes based on plant nutrients, with
   the exception of P. Tomato vegetative yield and tissue P were poor
   either because of phytotoxic nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-N) (>10 mg/kg)
   generated during the bioassay or because of WTR P deficiency. Limited
   data suggest that WTRs with NO2-N less than 10 mg/kg and Olsen P greater
   than 50 mg/kg, water soluble P greater than 580 mug/L, or Mehlich III P
   greater than 54 mg/kg support growth but still produce inadequate tissue
   P in tomatoes.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of heavy metal speciation and its relationship with biological
   responses is important for the derivation bf effects-based soil quality
   criteria. We determined soluble Cu concentrations and free Cu2+
   activities in the pore waters from 22 soils with total Cu varying from
   19 to 8645 mg kg(-1). Pore water pCu(2+), (= -log (Cu2+ activity))
   varied from 3.9 to 10.5 and was controlled by soil pH and total Cu
   concentration. The percentage of free Cu2+ in total soluble Cu varied
   from 0.02 to 96\% and was influenced strongly by pore water pH and, to a
   lesser extent, by dissolved organic C. In the pore waters with pH >6,
   the percentage of free Cu2+ in total soluble Cu was lo;ver than 1\%.
   Using the default data base and with the fulvic acid content of DOC
   optimized at 69\%, the equilibrium speciation program WHAM/Model VI gave
   estimates of pCu(2+) that agreed closely with measured values. Pore
   water samples were analyzed by two bioluminescence-based bacterial
   biosensors: Escherichia coli HB101 pUCD607 and Pseudomonas fluorescens
   10586r pUCD607. The response of P. fluorescens correlated more closely
   with soil pore water pCu(2+) than with soluble Cu concentration, whereas
   pCu(2+) and soluble Cu fitted the response of E. coli equally well. The
   effect concentrations (EC25 and EC50 values) of pCu(2+) for the two
   biosensors were about 5.8 and 5.0, respectively. This is the first time
   that threshold values for Cu have been obtained for bacterial biosensors
   exposed to soil pore water from well-equilibrated contaminated soils.}},

Abstract = {{This paper applies an option-pricing model to analyze the impact of
   uncertainty about output prices and expectations of declining fixed
   costs on the optimal timing of investment in site-specific crop
   management (SSCM). It also analyzes the extent to which the level of
   spatial variability in soil conditions can mitigate the value of waiting
   to invest in SSCM and influence the optimal timing or adoption and
   create a preference for custom hiring rather than owner purchase of
   equipment. Numerical simulations show that while the net present value
   (NPV) rule predicts that immediate adoption is profitable under most of
   the soil conditions considered here, recognition of the option value of
   investment indicates that it is preferable to delay investment in SSCM
   for at least 3 years unless average soil quality is high and the
   variability in soil quality and fertility is high. The use of the option
   value approach reveals that the value of waiting to invest in SSCM
   raises the cost-share subsidy rates required to induce immediate
   adoption above the levels indicated by the NPV rule. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sustainable use of natural resources continues to gain attention,
   especially in relation to energy and global carbon cycles. Biomass crops
   may offset fossil fuels and reduce CO2 contributions to greenhouse gases
   while improving soil and water quality. We review research on biomass
   crops, with emphasis on their specific characteristics and how their
   production can affect soil and water quality. Data from regions
   throughout the world are included, but the focus is primarily on recent
   research results from biomass crop production in the United States.
   Research to date shows promising short-term changes in soil and water
   quality, but responses vary. Short-term studies have demonstrated
   increases in surface soil organic-matter content, reduction in erosion
   and nutrient losses in surface runoff. We conclude that while the
   potential for benefits is present, data are not yet available to
   determine the long-term changes in soil quality associated with
   production of biomass crops.}},

Abstract = {{According to the official farm census there were 17 farms occupying over
   1000 ha of farmland in Mecklenburg-Schwerin and -Strelitz in 1925.
   Taking into account multiple ownership, private address book statistics
   show that there were 89 owners in Mecklenburg owning over 1000 ha of
   farmland. Between them, they owned 267 farms or regionally concentrated
   leaseholds (smaller tenant farms, domestic holdings, peasant
   smallholders) occupying a total of 158 100 ha farmland. On average,
   therefore, each of these big land owners had three farms with a total of
   1780 ha farmland.
   To this private land ownership, which accounted for 17 \% of the total
   farmland, must be added a further 416 state farms occupying 176 680 ha
   of farmland, so that the private land owners and the state together
   owned around 36 \% of the total farmland in Mecklenburg in 1927. Taking
   account only of properties over 100 ha in size, these proportions rise
   to approximately 50\% and 70\% (excluding and including state farms).
   The crucial feature of this study is the district-level analysis of all
   properties of over 1000 ha farmland (chaps. 5.1 to 5.7). In addition to
   the farmland, the total areas of the farms, the Livestock holdings and
   the quality of their soil have also been analysed. These district-level
   results for Mecklenburg-Schwerin and -Strelitz are contrasted with the
   figures for three districts in Schleswig-Holstein: Plon, Eckernforde and
   Oldenburg (chaps. 6.1 and 6.2).
   Each of the seven largest agricultural holdings in Mecklenburg-Schwerin
   embraced eight to 14 large farms (chap. 5.8) occupying around 4000 to
   6700 ha farmland, or a total farm area of between 4700 and 9300 ha On
   average, each owner possessed some 400 to 600 horses, 840 to 1500 head
   of cattle, 2000 to 6000 sheep, and around 1000 pigs. Data relating soil
   quality are available for half these holdings, and vary between
   approximately 20 000 and 30 000 per property.
   If the labour employed on these large holdings is extrapolated on the
   basis of the official structural survey of 1925, then each of their
   owners employed approximately 570 to 950 hands (mostly hired labour).
   Around 86 \% of the area occupied by these holdings of over 1000 ha
   farmland was in the hands of the aristocracy.
   Finally, these results were contrasted with individual farm figures for
   the modem successors of the former agricultural producers' co-operatives
   - averaging 1200 and 1800 ha farmland in size. Here, too, the labour
   forces and livestock holdings have been compared. In Mecklenburg-West
   Pomerania these farms occupy a good 50 \% of the total farmland (in the
   new federal states in eastern Germany, a good 60 \%). In
   Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, even almost 90 \% of the total farmed area
   is being worked by farms of over 200 ha farmland.}},

   over 400 separate transactions in farmland in England and Wales in 1994

   characteristics is computed. The analysis indicates that climate, soil

Abstract = {{Since 1991, several provinces in the Netherlands have put much effort in
   establishing soil-quality monitoring networks. The purpose of these
   networks is to provide insight in the trends in (geochemical) soil
   quality, on which new policies for environmental protection can be
   based, such as restrictions in certain landuse types and cleaner
   production processes. The soil quality networks are yet too young to
   serve this goal. Monitoring efforts are concentrated on micro- and
   macro-elements, particularly in the top layer of the soil (mainly heavy
   metals and PAH) as well as phreatic groundwater (mainly nitrates and
   phosphates) in the various regions of a province. The regional
   soil-quality monitoring networks focus explicitly on diffuse
   environmental pollution in the rural areas, which means that sample
   sites influenced by soil pollution caused by local sources are excluded.
   Regional differences in soil quality in the :rural areas are primarily
   caused by chemical and physical differences in the natural soil
   composition and by differences in deposition loads (direct and
   indirect). Hydrological conditions can also exert a large influence,
   particularly for nitrate leaching. This leads to three major criteria
   which the network design is based upon: (1) soil type, (2) landuse
   (assumed to be representative for deposition), and (3) groundwater
   tables. Subregions are formed by combining these criteria. Subregions
   are considered to be more or less homogeneous at a regional scale with
   respect to the criteria named. Within each region, a pre-calculated
   number of sites, based on variability of present concentrations, have
   been sampled and the sample material has been analyzed. Descriptive
   statistical parameters could thus computed; they are the base for the
   geochemical soil mapping of the individual, homogeneous subregions.
   A recent evaluation of all operational soil-quality monitoring networks
   shows that these networks are effective instruments to gain insight into
   the differences in quality of the soil and the phreatic groundwater
   between the various regions. The understanding of these differences and
   the processes that caused them provide the provincial authorities with
   valuable information for policy making and environmental management. The
   evaluation also reveals differences in network designs, mostly due to
   local differences in physical-chemical properties and political choices.
   It can be concluded from the first results of the networks that the
   relative high loads of zinc and copper, caused by spreading manure on
   the farmlands in areas of intensive agricultural landuse, have led to
   notably higher concentrations of those elements in the top layer of the
   soil compared to more natural lands like forested areas. The fact that
   the intensive agricultural landuse is mainly situated on relatively
   highly permeable sandy soils results in high nitrate concentrations in
   the phreatic groundwater, up to concentrations far beyond EG
   drinking-water target levels. First monitoring results signalled several
   environmental problems of which most of the policy makers were already
   aware, but could not quantify. Delineation of the most vulnerable areas
   and/or areas with unacceptably high loads and quantification of
   concentrations of different elements enable regional governments to take
   appropriate measures.
   The soil-quality monitoring networks will focus in the coming years on
   the effectiveness of the measures taken in the various areas. Efforts
   are being made to integrate the relatively new soil-quality monitoring
   networks and the longer existing groundwater-quality monitoring networks
   to achieve a better understanding of the (bio)geochemical cycling
   processes. Tuning the individual regional soil-quality monitoring
   networks of the various provinces will enable the provision of
   additional information about soil quality at a larger scale.}},

Abstract = {{A soil-quality map is at present an important tool to integrate laws on
   soil quality with regional infrastructural works. Basic data are
   commonly available, but soil quality is an indicator that has to be
   derived from these data, including site-specific environmental
   standards. We propose three geostatistics-based methods for the
   comparison of interpolated contaminant concentrations and standards.
   The study is illustrated by data from a part of the Betuwe railroad
   transect, which extends over 12 km in the western Netherlands. As it
   turns out, a useful procedure is to combine interpolated contaminant
   concentrations with interpolated threshold values.}},

Title = {{A comparison of soil and environmental quality under organic and

Abstract = {{Organic fanning in its various forms is seen by many as a sustainable
   alternative to conventional farming. This review considers and compares
   aspects of soil and environmental quality associated with organic and
   conventional farming systems under New Zealand conditions. The
   sustainability parameters considered include soil quality, nutrient
   dynamics, nutrient budgets, trace elements, and pesticides. The review
   used information from appropriate comparative studies conducted in New
   Zealand and overseas. However, because of the shortage of data on
   nutrient dynamics under organic systems in New Zealand,, we also used a
   nutrient balance model (OVERSEER) and a nitrogen leaching estimation
   model to assess the comparative sustainability of typical model systems.
   Interpretation of the measured data coupled with the results of the
   modelling exercise suggests that organic farming carried out according
   to the Bio-Gro New Zealand production standards can be sustainable if
   sufficient amounts of nutrient are returned to match removal and losses.
   Biodynamic farming may be unsustainable because nutrients removed in
   farm produce are not adequately replaced. Soil organic matter content
   and biological activity is generally higher under both types of organic
   system than under conventional systems. Trace element availability and
   use may limit the sustainability of organic systems if no attempt is
   made to address natural deficiencies common in New Zealand soils. The
   reduced use of pesticides may be beneficial for the wider environment.
   The main conclusion is that a concerted research effort is urgently
   required to address various soil and environmental quality issues
   associated with the large-scale adoption of organic farming practices in
   New Zealand.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the physical condition of soils under dairying in the Waikato
   and Northland regions was undertaken to determine the physical condition
   of the soil, possible changes from pugging damage, and the most
   appropriate measurements and sampling regimes for monitoring change.
   Sites were selected on widespread soil types (Allophanic and Gley Soils
   in the Waikato; Allophanic, Ultic, and Podzol Soils in Northland) and
   corresponded to never trodden, usual usage or conditions, and previously
   pugged (>18 months ago) pasture. Soil cores were collected at 50-mm
   depth increments for determination of bulk density, total porosity,
   saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, proportion of pores
   greater than 30 and 60 mum, and aggregate size class.
   The 0-100-mm depth was best for showing differences between treading
   regimes. Within this depth, hydraulic conductivity and aggregate size
   showed the greatest differences between regimes. All measurements were
   useful for showing differences in the Waikato data. However, for
   Northland, bulk density, total porosity, and proportion of pores were
   not always indicators of change. Approximately 20 cores were needed per
   regime to show differences. Soil properties on most soil types were
   still affected 18 months after a pugging event. Measurements selected
   for showing change varied depending on whether data were for geographic
   regions, a single region, or a particular soil type.}},

Abstract = {{The `landscape mosaic' hypothesis predicts that adult male capercaillie
   Tetrao urogallus track available habitat when making distinct seasonal
   migrations. We tested this hypothesis by comparing movement from leks to
   summer range in three geographical regions, viz. northwest Russia
   (Pechora), southwest Russia (Tver) and southeast Norway (Varaldskogen).
   All radio-collared males dispersed out of their daytime lek territories
   to an average distance of 2.3 km (+/-0.37) from lek centres (N = 52). In
   Russia, three birds, which were not included in this estimate, moved
   beyond the 6-7 km detection distance, but returned the following year.
   Due to large variation among birds at each lek, the only significant
   difference in movement was found between the birds at the lek in Pechora
   ((x) over bar = 1.3 km) and those at one of the two leks in Tver ((x)
   over bar = 3.6 km) and at one of the three leks in Norway ((x) over bar
   = 3.2 km). At all leks except the one in Tver, the amount of suitable
   summer habitat, e.g. old Norway spruce Picea abies forest on rich soil,
   was smaller within a 1-km radius of leks centres than in the outer two
   1-km zones. Despite a large proportion of old spruce forest at and near
   the lek site in Tver, the males at this site moved >2 km from the lek
   centre in late May/early June. When data were pooled, the dispersal
   distance did not correlate with the amount of old spruce forest nor with
   the size of patches (e.g. grain size) with increasing distance from
   leks. However, at the Norwegian study area, which is highly fragmented
   with a fine-grained habitat mosaic due to commercial forestry, variation
   in topography and soil quality birds tended to move farther away from
   the leks with increasing patch size and with increasing proportion of
   old spruce forest. When fitting a second polynomial regression function
   to the pooled data, there was only a weak relationship between dispersal
   distance and grain size for leks (P = 0.19). When including all birds,
   the relationship was highly significant (P = 0.002). The Pechora lek in
   northwest Russia contributed mainly to the lack of a clear relationship
   between movement pattern and distribution of old spruce forest. Here
   large, contiguous bands of old spruce forest were located along the main
   river courses in a coarse-grained fashion within 2 km of lek sites.
   Thus, local configuration of preferred summer habitat at the landscape
   scale probably affects both direction and movement to a larger extent
   than predicted from the `landscape mosaic' hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen fertility is an important component of rice (Oryza sativa L.)
   cultivation systems, especially where air and soil quality issues have
   prompted a search for alternatives to rice straw burning. This study
   examined the effects of different rice straw management practices and
   winter flooding on yield, N uptake, and N use efficiency. The
   experiment, established on two sites in California, was initiated in
   1993 on a Sodic Endoaquert near Maxwell and in 1994 on a Xeric Duraquert
   near Biggs. Main plot treatments were winter flooding and no winter
   flooding, and four straw management practices-straw burned,
   incorporated, relied, and baled/removed-were subplot treatments. Zero N
   fertilizer microplots were established yearly in each plot. At currently
   recommended N fertilization levels, where other nutrients were
   sufficient, grain yield was unaffected by alternative straw management
   or winter flooding. However, in the third year after experiment
   initiation, the grain yield in zero N fertilizer plots was greater where
   straw was retained, i.e., incorporated and rolled. La Years 3 through 5
   at Maxwell, straw retention increased N uptake by rice by an average of
   19 kg N ha(-1) where no N fertilizer was applied and by It kg N ha(-1)
   at recommended rate of N fertilizer application. Winter flooding further
   increased crop N uptake when straw. was retained. The additional
   available soil N from straw Led to increased N uptake without
   corresponding increased grain yield, which decreased N use efficiency
   and necessitates the re-evaluation of N fertilizer application rates.}},

Abstract = {{In response to concerns over the widespread soil degradation occurring
   on Canada's agricultural lands, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada
   established a network of benchmark sites to assess soil quality change
   by monitoring agronomically important soil properties. The Nova Scotia
   site was established in 1989 on Queens (Gleyed Brunisolic Gray Luvisols)
   and Debert (Gleyed Dystric Brunisols) soil series under a corn-forage
   rotation within the Annapolis-Minas Lowlands ecoregion. The objectives
   of the project were to quantify temporal changes in agronomically
   important soil properties and determine how the property values vary
   with the landscape and components of the soil map unit. A 20 x 25 m grid
   was used in 1990 and again in 1995 to sample soil from the Ap horizon
   and to locate saturated hydraulic conductivity and penetration
   resistance measurements. The samples were analyzed for pH, organic C,
   total N, and available P and K. The results indicate that over 5 yr.
   organic C, C:N ratio, available P, and saturated hydraulic conductivity
   declined by 7.9, 4.7, 12.5, and 53\%, respectively. Significant
   differences in pH, organic C, total N, available K, penetration
   resistance and saturated hydraulic conductivity were associated with
   selected components of the soil map unit. Slope position had a minimal
   effect on soil proper ties except for available K where the highest
   levels were located on middle slope positions. Interactions between
   particle size and slope position were found. with soils with
   coarse-loamy sola on upper slope positions having the lowest pH. The
   results of this study also demonstrated the utility of the method for
   monitoring soil quality change and the importance of the soil map unit
   in interpreting the spatial and temporal differences in soil properties.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of using
   sewage sludge for ameliorating landfill cover soils by assessing soil
   biology and nutrient cycling because of the poor physical property and
   nutrient contents. An acidic sandy loam of these low graded subsoil
   materials commonly used for landfill cover. soil was amended with sewage
   sludge at 0, 2.5, 5, 15 and 35\% w/w fresh weight. An increase in the
   sludge amendment rate caused a rise in both pH and electrical
   conductivity (EC). However, with incubation time, pH decreased while EC
   increased and then declined. Nevertheless, salinity and heavy metal
   contents of the sludge amended soil were all within the toxic limits.
   Soluble NH4+-N, NO3--N and PO43--P increased after amending the soil
   with sewage sludge. However, increasing the sludge application rate
   decreased the N mineralization efficiency and created an adverse effect
   on nitrification, while the P- mineralization efficiency was enhanced by
   sludge amendment. The sharp peaks of NH4+-N at day 21 with a
   concentration of 280 and 520 mg kg(-1) for 15\% and 35\% sludge amended
   soil would probably be a limitation to plant growth. Soil respiration,
   as an indicator of microbial activity, demonstrated the same pattern for
   all treatments that CO2 evolution increased initially and then decreased
   until the end of incubation. The peak soil respiration was at day 7 for
   all treatments, except for the soil amended with 35\% of sludge which
   had a peak at day 2 and of much higher lever than others. The present
   results indicated that a sludge amendment rate of 5 to 15\% would have
   the optimal beneficial effects on the cover soil quality in terms of
   microbial activity and nutrient mineralization.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) is a central contributor to soil quality as it
   mediates many of the chemical, physical, and biological processes
   controlling the capacity of a soil to perform successfully. SOM
   properties (e.g. C/N ratio, macro-organic matter) have been proposed as
   diagnostic criteria of overall soil fitness, but their use is hampered
   by a poor understanding of the basic biochemical principles underlying
   SOM processes. The objective of this project was to determine the
   influence of scrub oak. (Quercus dumosa Nutt.) and Coulter pine (Pinus
   coulteri B. Don) vegetation on decomposition and SOM formation processes
   in a lysimeter installation constructed in 1936 in the San Gabriel
   mountains of southern California. Soil samples archived during
   construction of the installation, and A horizons sampled in 1987, were
   fractionated according to density and mineral particle size to isolate
   the water floatable (macro-organic matter), fine silt and clay
   fractions. Carbon turnover rates were determined on all fractions from
   AMS C-14 measurements. Solid state CPMAS TOSS C-13 NMR was used to
   semiquantitatively characterize the chemical structure of organic matter
   on fresh litter and soil fractions. For the two soils, there was a
   progressive decrease in O-alkyl C, and an increase in alkyl and carbonyl
   C from the litter to the floatable, fine silt and clay fractions. These
   compositional differences were due to the oxidative degradation of the
   litter material, with preferential decomposition of the cellulose and
   hemicellulose entities and selective preservation of recalcitrant waxes
   and resins. in all soil fractions, turnover rates of carbon were longer
   for the pine than for the oak lysimeter (up to 10 times longer). Also
   under pine, there was a gradual increase in turnover rate progressing
   from the floatable to the clay fraction, and differences in turnover
   rates among fractions may be explained based on differences in carbon
   chemistry. In contrast, under oak, rapid carbon turnover for all
   fractions suggested intense biological activity in this soil. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Because of the rapid increase in the world's population, demand for
   forest products is increasing while large amounts of forest land are
   being lost or degraded. In addition, timber harvest is being restricted
   in many of the world's natural forests. The use of plantations managed
   for timber production must increase to meet the world's increasing
   demand for wood and fiber from this reduced land base. Concentrating
   timber production on the best-adapted sites will allow the world's
   demands to be met on fewer acres. Intensive management of plantation
   forests is perhaps the only way to meet the increasing demand for forest
   products and still reserve large areas of native forests for
   conservation and preservation purposes. Maintaining long-term soil
   productivity in these intensively managed plantations is critical. The
   impacts of intensive management on soil quality and subsequent tree
   growth can be positive, neutral or negative; the direction and magnitude
   of the impact depends on the specific management practice soil physical,
   chemical and biological properties. In order to understand and predict
   the impacts of intensive management, the factors limiting productivity
   on each specific site must be understood.
   Forest harvesting by itself tends to have minor impacts on soil quality
   and long-term site productivity. Compaction during timber harvesting can
   degrade the soil quality. However, tillage during site preparation can
   in most cases restore soil physical properties to pre-disturbance
   levels. Site preparation practices that remove large quantities of
   organic matter and surface soil can detrimentally impact soil quality,
   most notably on sandy soils. Intensive management practices such as
   fertilization can improve soil quality and increase site productivity by
   ameliorating factors Limiting growth. The increased growth rates in
   intensively managed stands can indirectly improve soil quality by
   increasing organic matter. The increased production of coarse roots in
   intensively managed plantations is particularly important in this
   regard. These changes can lead to long-term improvement in soil quality
   and site productivity, especially on the degraded soils on which many
   forest plantations are established.
   Based on the available data, intensive management can be practiced
   sustainably on many soils. Land classification systems are needed to
   identify soils that are suitable for intensive management. Site-specific
   management regimes must then be developed to insure that intensive
   management is practiced sustainably on these soils. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Foresters have always relied on a knowledge of chemical and physical
   properties of soils to assess capacity of sites to support productive
   forests. Recently, the need for assessing soil properties has expanded
   because of growing public interest in determining consequences of
   management practices on the quality of soil relative to sustainability
   of forest ecosystem functions in addition to plant productivity. The
   concept of soil quality includes assessment of soil properties and
   processes as they relate to ability of soil to function effectively as a
   component of a healthy ecosystem. Specific functions and subsequent
   values provided by forest ecosystems are variable and rely on numerous
   soil physical, chemical, and biological properties and processes, which
   can differ across spatial and temporal scales. Choice of a standard set
   of specific properties as indicators of soil quality can be complex and
   will vary among forest systems and management objectives. Indices of
   forest soil quality which incorporate soil chemical, physical, and
   biological properties will be most readily adopted if they are sensitive
   to management-induced changes, easily measured, relevant across sites or
   over time, inexpensive, closely linked to measurement of desired values,
   and adaptable for specific ecosystems. This paper traces development of
   the concept of soil quality, explores use of soil chemical and physical
   properties as determinants of forest soil quality, and presents
   challenges and opportunities for forest soil scientists to play a
   relevant role in assessment and advancement of sustainable forest
   management by developing the concept of soil quality as an indicator of
   sustainability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality indices can help ensure that site productivity and soil
   function are maintained. Biological indices yield evidence of how a soil
   functions and interacts with the plants, animals and climate that
   comprise an ecosystem. Soil scientists can identify and quantify both
   chemical and biological soil-quality indicators for ecosystems with a
   single main function, such as agricultural lands and forest plantations.
   However, quantifying these indices in complex ecosystems - that have
   multiple uses or goals such as maintaining biodiversity, aesthetics,
   recreation, timber production and water quality - is much more
   difficult. In an ecosystem context all components - plants, animals and
   humans - interact with the soil differently, making soil quality indices
   variable. These interactions result in a combination of biological
   processes that make each ecosystem unique. We examined the soil and site
   quality of five forest stands (xeric oak-pine; two mixed hardwood, cove
   hardwood, northern hardwood), within the 2185-ha Coweeta Hydrologic
   Laboratory. An initial rank of soil quality based on soil chemical and
   physical properties was assigned. The ranking was then compared with
   four common groups of soil biological indicators: (1) nitrogen
   availability; (2) litter decomposition; (3) soil microarthropod
   populations; and (4) carbon availability. We also examined estimates of
   overstory productivity, overstory biodiversity and total aboveground
   productivity for each site as indices of site quality. We found that
   soil and site quality rankings varied with the indicator, showing that
   the soil or site of greatest quality may change depending on the use or
   goal of the ecosystem under examination. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Long-term agricultural field experiments provide relevant information
   for questions being asked about the sustainability of managed forests,
   particularly as management regimes become more intensive. In this paper,
   concepts and criteria related to sustainable site productivity are
   reviewed and findings from a range of long-term agricultural field
   experiments are evaluated. Based on this evaluation, the following site
   productivity principles are identified: (1) soil organic matter is the
   Link between most management systems and sustainable site productivity;
   (2) nutrient deficiencies can be corrected; (3) soil texture is a key
   variable affecting soil organic matter and site productivity; (4) return
   of crop residues enhances soil organic matter and site productivity; and
   (5) productive cropping systems have environmental benefits. While
   technological advances have proven to be highly successful for enhancing
   long-term crop yields, they also have the potential to mask underlying
   declines in site productivity. This hypothesis needs to be rigorously
   tested.
   Agricultural field experiments show that crop productivity can be
   sustained for long time periods when appropriate management approaches
   are applied. Management requirements to achieve sustainability differ,
   however, depending on site-specific edaphic and climatic characteristics
   and the needs of the crop. Site productivity principles derived from
   agricultural field studies are also highly relevant to sustaining site
   productivity of managed forests. Several characteristics of managed
   forests should be considered when extrapolating conclusions from
   agricultural experiments. These include harvest removals of biomass and
   nutrients, residue type and distribution, management and system
   characteristics, and soil types used. Many characteristics associated
   with even intensively managed forests are sought as goals of
   conservation cropping systems and should contribute toward sustaining
   long-term site productivity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Soil quality standards and guidelines of the USDA Forest Service were
   some of the first in the world to be developed to evaluate changes in
   forest soil productivity and sustainability after harvesting and site
   preparation. International and national development of criteria and
   indicators for maintenance of soil productivity make it imperative to
   have adequate threshold variables within the USDA Forest Service. In the
   Pacific Northwest soils range from fine-textured Andisols to
   coarse-textured skeletal Inceptisols. Forest types encompass the highly
   productive coastal rain forest to marginally productive, dry, cold sites
   in the interior mountains. Constant values to detect detrimental
   disturbances within the soil quality guidelines are routinely applied
   across diverse soils and timber types and include diagnostic criteria
   for evaluating management-caused changes to soil productivity. Research
   information from short- or long-term research studies supporting the
   applicability of disturbance criteria is often lacking, or is available
   from a limited number of sites which have relatively narrow climatic and
   soil ranges. In this paper we calculated changes in soil carbon,
   nitrogen, erosion, and cation exchange capacity using threshold
   variables from the Regional USDA Forest Service Soil Guidelines to
   assess their applicability across diverse landscapes. Soils were
   selected from a climatic and elevational gradient in the Pacific
   Northwest. Application of selected USDA Forest Service standards
   indicate that blanket threshold variables applied over disparate soils
   do not adequately account for nutrient distribution within the profile
   or forest floor depth. These types of guidelines should be continually
   refined to reflect pre-disturbance conditions and site-specific
   information. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Little information exists regarding the effects of field-scale
   application of paper mill sludge on soil properties. A 5-yr field study
   determined the long-term effects of land application of paper mill
   sludge on an agricultural soil. The goal of this study was to determine
   the responses of soil chemical and physical properties to multiple
   applications of sludge. Five rates of sludge application were tested,
   ranging from 0 to 225 Mg ha(-1) in multiple applications under three
   management protocols: applied once, applied in alternate gears, or
   applied annually. Results indicate strong relationships between added
   sludge C and several soil physical properties. Increases or maintenance
   of soil C were observed when sludge was applied annually or biennially,
   but little residual effect of the single application was seen after 5
   yr. Significant increases were observed in soil aggregation and moisture
   holding properties at higher rates of sludge application and when
   cumulative C additions reached 225 Mg ha(-1) in other sludge application
   rates. It was concluded that long-term paper mill sludge application can
   be managed to effect positive changes in soil physical properties that
   are correlated to soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated soil erosion can impact upon agronomic productivity by
   reducing topsoil depth (TSD), decreasing plant available water capacity
   and creating nutrient imbalance in soil and within plant. Research
   information on soil-specific cause-effect relationship is needed to
   develop management strategies for restoring productivity of eroded
   soils. Therefore, two field experiments were established on Alfisols in
   central Ohio to quantify erosion-induced changes in soil properties and
   assess their effects on corn growth and yield. Experiment 1 involved
   studying the effects of past erosion on soil properties and corn yield
   on field runoff plots where soil was severely eroded and comparing it
   with that on adjacent slightly eroded soil. In addition, soil properties
   and corn grain yield in runoff plots were compared on side-slopes with
   that on toe-slopes or depositional sites. Experiment 2 involved relating
   corn growth and yield to topsoil depth on a sloping land. With
   recommended rates of fertilizer application, corn grain yield did not
   differ among erosional phases. Fertilizer application masked the adverse
   effects of erosion on corn yield. Corn grain yield on depositional sites
   was about 50 per cent more than that on side-slope position. Corn plants
   on the side-slope positions exhibited symptoms of nutrient deficiency,
   and the ear leaves contained significantly lower concentrations of P and
   Mg and higher concentrations of Mn and K than those grown on
   depositional sites. Corn grain yield in experiment 2 was positively
   correlated with the TSD. Soil in the depositional site contained
   significantly more sand and silt and less clay than that on the
   side-slope position. There were also differences in soil properties
   among erosional phases. The soil organic carbon (SOC) content was 19.7 g
   kg(-1) in slightly eroded compared with 15.1 g kg(-1) in severely eroded
   sites. Aggregate stability and the mean weight diameter (MWD) were also
   significantly more in slightly eroded than severely eroded soils.
   Adverse effects of severe erosion on soil quality were related to
   reduction in soil water retention, and decrease in soil concentration of
   N and P, and increase in those of K, Ca and Mg. Severe erosion increased
   leaf nutrient contents of K, Mn and Fe and decreased those of Ca and Mg.
   Corn grain yield was positively correlated with aggregation, silt and
   soil N contents. It was also negatively correlated with leaf content of
   Fe. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Soil knowledge and care have apparently lost most of their importance
   for french agriculture during the last decades. This was due to the
   agronomy and industry success in fertility management, water management
   and mechanisation. Nowadays changes in economic conditions and
   agriculture policy, environment issues and seek for sustainability are
   generating a reverse trend More precise and exhaustive informations on
   soil properties and their spatial variations become necessary to face
   the new challenges for agriculture: saving costs, improving products
   qualities, reducing pollutions, protecting biodiversity and preventing
   long terme soil degradations. New tools are also required to use this
   more complex amount of informations in an efficient way. Modelling, data
   bases and CIS have to be linked in decision helping systems. For farmers
   technical assessment, land planning and policy decision making at
   different scales. Soil knowledge and data, bases must be integrated in
   such systems in France. Availables geographic soil data bases are for
   too poor to answer these needs. New programmes are developed to complete
   a national soil data base with a multiscale purpose and set up a soil
   quality observation network.}},

Abstract = {{Appropriate indicators for assessing soil quality on a regional scale
   using the National Resource Inventory (NRI) are unknown. Oar objectives
   were to (i) identify soil quality factors present at a regional scale,
   (ii) determine which factors vary significantly with land use, and (iii)
   select soil attributes within these factors that can be used as soil
   quality indicators for regional-scale assessment. Ascalon (fine-loamy,
   mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustoll) and Amarillo (fine-loamy,
   mixed, thermic Aridic Paleustalf) soils were sampled from a
   statistically representative subset of NRI sample paints within the
   Central and Southern High Plains Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA) and
   analyzed for 20 soil attributes. Factor analysis was used to identify
   soil quality factors, and discriminant analysis was used to identify the
   factors and indicators most sensitive to land use within each MLRA. In
   the Central High Plains, five soil quality factors were identified, with
   the organic matter and color factors varying significantly with land
   use. Discriminant analysis selected total organic C (TOC) and total N as
   the most sensitive indicators of soil quality at a regional scale. In
   the Southern High Plains, six factors were identified, with water stable
   aggregate (WSA) content, TOC, and soil salinity varying significantly
   with land use. Discriminant analysis selected TOC and WSA content as the
   most sensitive indicators of soil quality in the Southern High Plains.
   Total organic C was the only indicator that consistently showed
   significant differences between land uses in both regions.}},

   of soil quality factors and indicators at a regional scale. Our
   objectives were (i) to identify soil quality factors for a diverse
   population of soils at the regional scale, (ii) to determine which
   factors vary significantly with land use, (iii) to select indicators
   from these factors that can be used with the National Resource Inventory
   (NRI) for monitoring soil quality, and (iv) to compare these results to
   a similar study involving only a single Soil series. One hundred
   eighty-six points representing 75 soil series in the Northern
   Mississippi Valley Loess Halls and 149 points representing 58 son series
   in Palouse and Net Perce Prairies were sampled from a statistically
   representative subset of NRI sample points and analyzed for 20 soil
   attributes. Factor analysis was used to identify soil quality factors
   and discriminant analysis was used to identify factors and indicators
   most sensitive to land use within each region. In the Northern
   Mississippi Valley Loess Hills, five soil quality factors were
   identified. Discriminant analysis selected potentially mineralizable N
   (PMN), microbial biomass C (MBC), warier stable aggregates (WSA), and
   total organic C (TOC) as the most discriminating attributes between land
   uses. In the Palouse and Net Perce Prairies, six factors were
   identified. Discriminant analysis selected TOC and total N as the most
   discriminating attributes between land uses. The soil quality factors
   were similar among three of the four regions, but TOC was the only
   indicator common to all regions for distinguishing among land uses.}},

Abstract = {{Soil structure is an important measure of soil quality that
   significantly affects crop production, water-use efficiency, and soil
   erosion. More effective techniques to measure soil structure are needed
   to determine if a tillage operation achieves the desired result and
   whether soil management practices are improving or degrading soil
   structure. A fiber-optic displacement sensor was used to scan the
   surface of bulk samples of soil aggregates. The soil was air dried and
   sieved to aggregate size fractions of < 0.18, 0.18-0.25, 0.25-0.5,
   0.5-1, 1-2, 2-4, and 4-8 mm. The sensor following a blade to level the
   surface at a constant distance beneath the sensor tip, was moved at 5.08
   mm/s by a universal testing machine. Voltage output of the sensor was
   recorded with data acquisition software at sampling rates of 10, 100,
   and 200 Hz. Mean sensor output voltage decreased significantly (P =
   0.05) as aggregate size increased. Values measured for the aggregate
   size fractions, in the order listed above, were 4.6, 3.1, 2.5, 1.5, 0.8
   and 0.2 V, respectively. Data sampling rate had negligible effect on
   mean output voltage. The number of peaks in the sensor output signal was
   affected by aggregate size, but was comparatively independent of the gap
   between sensor and soil surface. Data sampling rate should be greater
   than 20 readings/mm in order to use the number of peaks in the sensor
   output signal for discriminating among aggregates of the sizes evaluated
   in this research. The results indicated that the fiber-optic soil
   structure sensor may have potential for use in evaluating soil
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Indicators of land quality (LQIs) are being developed as a means to
   better coordinate actions on land related issues, such as land
   degradation. Economic and social indicators are already in regular use
   to support decision making at global, national and sub-national levels
   and in some cases for air and water quality, but few such indicators are
   available to assess, monitor and evaluate changes in the quality of land
   resources. Land refers not just to soil but to the combined resources of
   terrain, water, soil and biotic resources that provide the basis for
   land use. Land quality refers to the condition of land relative to the
   requirements of land use, including agricultural production, forestry,
   conservation, and environmental management.
   The LQI program addresses the dual objectives of environmental
   monitoring as well as sector performance monitoring for managed
   ecosystems (agriculture, forestry, conservation and environmental
   management). The primary research issue in the LQI program is the
   development of indicators that identify and characterize the impact(s)
   of human interventions on the landscape for the major agroecological
   zones of tropical, sub-tropical and temperate environments. Core LQIs
   identified for immediate development are: nutrient balance, yield gap,
   land use intensity and diversity, and land cover; LQIs requiring longer
   term research include: soil quality, land degradation, and
   agro-biodiversity; LQIs being developed by other authoritative groups
   include: water quality, forestland quality, rangeland quality, and land
   contamination/pollution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A Canadian initiative to define and estimate indicators of the
   relationship between agricultural activities and environmental quality
   has been under way since 1993. This paper focuses on those indicators
   related to land quality and highlights the use of GIS to reconfigure
   land use and climatic data to a soil landscape spatial model in order to
   apply models of soil degradation. The 1981 and 1991 Census of
   agriculture data from a cadastral base and climatic indices from
   iso-contour maps are related to the soil landscapes of Canada to
   identify trends in the amount of soil cover, the risk of soil erosion by
   wind and the risk of soil salinization. Results indicate that soil cover
   has improved by about 11\% through the use of conservation tillage and
   crop residue management and reduced summerfallowing, and that the risk
   of wind erosion in the prairies has decreased by 7\% in the 10 years.
   The risk of soil salinization has remained constant on 93\% of cropland,
   decreased on 7\% and increased on <1\%. It appears that the improvements
   in soil quality protection have occurred despite some shifts to more
   intensive cropping systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2000 Published by

Abstract = {{The current pressure on land resources necessitates the development of
   sustainable land management (SLM) systems. The process of developing
   such systems requires that methods are available to assess
   sustainability easily. Indicators of SLM need to include indicators of
   soil quality and land quality, but in addition they must take account of
   the environmental setting and include the more human aspects of land
   management: the social, economic and political aspects.
   Three case studies were undertaken to assess the sustainability of
   different land management systems practised by farmers on sloping lands
   of Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Using the framework for evaluating
   sustainable land management (FESLM), detailed socio-economic and
   biophysical surveys were undertaken of 53 farms. The surveys aimed to
   characterise the land management systems, outline their constraints and
   potentials, and identify indicators and thresholds of sustainability in
   line with the five pillars of sustainability in the FESLM: productivity,
   security, protection, viability, and acceptability.
   The data were used to develop a suite of SLM indicators, with associated
   thresholds. These indicators have been included in a prototype decision
   support system (DSS). Feedback on the indicators was obtained from the
   farmers after the DSS was used to evaluate their farming systems. The
   indicators are highly specific as well as simplified, but they make a
   useful first step towards the development of a more generic system for
   evaluating SLM and for more accurate site specific and integrated
   evaluation. Evaluation of this structured and systematic approach
   yielded encouraging results in a separate study in Nepal. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{With the advent of information technology there is a renewed interest to
   define and identify homogenous food production systems. International
   donor agencies, such as the World Bank and the US Agency for
   International Development, are especially interested in public/private
   partnerships to develop and integrate information including the
   socio-economic/cultural contexts of farm systems to improve knowledge
   about food systems, nationally to globally. The International
   Agricultural Research Centers, non-government organizations and national
   institutions require a spatial-temporal-hierarchical information system
   describing farm systems and communities from the `nation to the farm'.
   Agri-business requires methods to evaluate the performance of crop
   systems in varied environments in countries and/or around the world.
   As the society is stratified by different information needs, decisions
   must be made about the units of study and the hierarchy of information
   integration. The proposed hierarchy, developed on the tenets of
   hierarchy theory, implies that optimization of biodiversity, ecosystem
   health and integrity, commodity production, or maintaining soil quality,
   are each articulated based on the objectives that apply to the planning
   area. Management goals, therefore, determine the planning area to be
   defined, the goods and services, and the desired conditions of the
   ecosystem. Defined biophysical units, such as resource management
   domains (RMDs), serve as a common denominator for synthesis of
   information which could be shared by a range of disciplines, such as
   hydrology, geomorphology, pedology, crop science, economics, sociology,
   land-use planning, and production technology In this approach, system
   dynamics or temporal variations are de-emphasized with the assumption
   that each RMD has attained an equilibrium or quasi-equilibrium within
   the planning horizon of the society. This is due to the practical
   purpose for which land resource assessments are generally made. However,

Abstract = {{A strategy to measure bacterial functional redundancy was developed and
   tested with soils collected along a soil reclamation gradient by
   determining the richness and diversity of bacterial groups capable of in
   situ growth on selected carbon substrates. Soil cores were collected
   from four sites along a transect from the Jamari tin mine site in the
   Jamari National Forest, Rondonia, RO, Brazil: denuded mine spoil, soil
   from below the canopy of invading pioneer trees, revegetated soil under
   new growth on the forest edge, and the forest floor of an adjacent
   preserved forest. Bacterial population responses were analyzed by
   amending these soil samples with individual carbon substrates in the
   presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), BrdU-labeled DNA was then
   subjected to a 16S-23S rRNA intergenic analysis to depict the actively
   growing bacteria from each site, The number and diversity of bacterial
   groups responding to four carbon substrates (L-serine, L-threonine,
   sodium citrate, and or-lactose hydrate) increased along the
   reclamation-vegetation gradient such that the preserved forest soil
   samples contained the highest functional redundancy for each substrate.
   These data suggest that bacterial functional redundancy increases in
   relation to the regrowth of plant communities and may therefore
   represent an important aspect of the restoration of soil biological
   functionality to reclaimed mine spoils. They also suggest that bacterial
   functional redundancy may be a useful indicator of soil quality and
   ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{1 The New England cobble beach plant community is an intertidal
   assemblage of halophytic forbs found exclusively behind fringing beds of
   the grass Spartina alterniflora. The purpose of this study was to
   determine the life stage and factors that limit the upper (landward)
   distribution of cobble beach plants in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island,
   USA.
   2 Seed traps and soil samples above the community border contained large
   numbers of seeds and buried seedlings of three cobble beach species,
   indicating that seed supply and germination do not limit vertical plant
   distribution. Experimentally added seeds of four species germinated
   above the community border, but seedlings did not emerge suggesting that
   seedling emergence is the proximate life stage limiting population and
   community distribution.
   3 Measures of wave disturbance (cobble movement and change in cobble
   depth) indicated that substrate instability is substantially greater
   above than within the community, probably due to the lack of buffering
   by the S. alterniflora bed at higher tidal heights.
   4 A second seed addition experiment demonstrated that seedlings of
   Suaeda linearis, a common cobble beach forb, are only able to emerge and
   grow into reproductive adults above the community border when the
   substrate there is artificially stabilized. Seedling transplants and
   glasshouse manipulations demonstrated that neither herbivores nor soil
   quality limited seedling emergence.
   5 Overall, the vertical restriction of habitat modification by S.
   alterniflora appears to result in substrate instability at higher tidal
   elevations sufficient to prevent seedling emergence and limit the
   vertical distribution of cobble beach plants.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of interactions between arbuscular-mycorrhizal fungi

   abundance of mycotrophic weed species (hosts of AMF), and
   non-mycotrophic species (non-hosts). These effects may merely change the
   composition of weed communities without affecting the damage that these
   communities cause. However, it is quite plausible that interactions with
   AMF can increase the beneficial effects of weeds on the functioning of
   agro-ecosystems. Through a variety of mechanisms, weed:AMF interactions
   may reduce crop yield losses to weeds, limit weed species shifts, and
   increase positive effects of weeds on soil quality and beneficial
   organisms. If beneficial effects of AMF on the composition and
   functioning of weed communities can be confirmed by more direct
   evidence, then AMF could provide a new means of ecologically-based weed
   management. Intentional management will be required to increase
   diversity and abundance of AMF in many cropping systems, but these
   actions (e.g. conservation tillage and use of cover and green-manure
   crops) typically will confer a range of agronomic benefits in addition
   to potential improvements in weed management.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known on how management of Russian native grasslands affects
   botanical composition, soil and forage properties. Three fields were
   sampled in the V.V. Alekhin Central-Chernozem Biosphere State Reserve in
   the Kursk region of Russia: a native grassland (not cultivated for at
   least 300 years), a grazed/hay field with 4 years of annual harvest
   followed by 1 year of rest (periodically-cut grazed/hay field), and a
   yearly-cut grazed/hay field. Soil samples were collected from the top 10
   cm and analyzed. Plant species were identified at the sampling sites and
   this plant material was used to determine total elemental analysis of
   forage, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid
   detergent fiber (ADF), in vitro true digestibility (IVTD) and lignin
   concentrations. Above-ground live and dead plant material and roots were
   analyzed for C, N and lignin. Soil sample analysis showed that fields
   were comparable in terms of soil chemical and physical properties. SOC
   and N contents were not statistically different in the native and yearly
   grazed/hay fields. Soil bulk density significantly increased as a result
   of utilization, from 0.80+/-0.09 Mg m(-3) for the native grassland to
   0.97+/-0.06 Mg m(-3) for the yearly grazed/hay field. A total of 107
   different plant species were recorded at the three fields. There were
   changes in plant composition among the fields. The native grassland
   field had the least number of plant species (41) followed by the
   yearly-cut grazed/hay field (68), and the periodically-cut grazed/hay
   field (87). There was a greater proportion of grass species (20\%) in
   the native grassland field. Dead plant biomass and roots from the
   grazed/hay fields were higher in N and Lignin concentrations. Forage
   mineral concentration was highest in the periodically-cut hay field. No
   significant differences were observed in terms of forage properties. (C)

Abstract = {{The development of conservation tillage systems for cotton (Gossypium
   hirsutum L.), capable of reducing soil erosion and improving soil
   quality while increasing yields and profits, remains a challenge in the
   southeastern USA. Poor emergence and growth, delayed maturity, and
   reduced yield are some of the problems that have been encountered in the
   use of conservation tillage on cotton. The objectives of this study was
   to evaluate the effects of tillage (no-till, mulch-till, conventional
   till), cropping system {[}cotton-winter fallow, cotton-winter rye
   (Secale cereale L.) cover crop] and N source (poultry litter, ammonium
   nitrate) on growth and yield of cotton from 1996 to 1998 in northern
   Alabama. In 1997, cotton lint yield under no-till (NT) was 24 and 18\%
   greater than that under conventional fill (CT) and mulch-till (MT)
   systems, respectively. In 1998, cotton lint yield under the NT system
   was 7\% greater than that under CT. Poultry litter (PL) at 100 kg N
   ha(-1) gave similar lint yield to ammonium nitrate (AN), whereas at 200
   kg N ha(-1), lint yields were significantly greater. No-till,
   cotton-winter rye cropping, and surface application of 200 kg N ha(-1)
   in form of PL conserved soil moisture in the top 7 cm of the soil. This
   resulted in early seedling emergence, high seedling vigor, good plant
   growth, and high lint yield of cotton. These treatments would be
   appropriate for use in the southeastern USA where soil erosion is a
   problem and plenty of PL is available each year from the poultry
   industry.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the accelerating globalization of trade, environmental impacts
   and information, there remain huge disparities in the availability, cost
   and use of nutrients for plant production between rich and poor
   countries. The sustainability of African farming systems gives
   particular cause for concern, given the high cost and poor market
   opportunities faced by many small producers. Markets are essential if
   farmers are to be able to afford the purchase of necessary inputs.
   Raising productivity within African agriculture must address the
   challenge of tailoring policy and intervention to the diverse settings,
   strategies and practices found across the continent. Account must be
   taken of climatic risk, differences in soil quality, balancing the use
   of organic and mineral inputs, and returns from farming versus other
   activities, as well as providing a research and extension framework that
   supports joint learning with farmers in order to develop more
   sustainable cropping systems.}},

Abstract = {{Nest building and foraging activities are two of the many ways that ants
   impact on the surrounding soil environment within and beyond the mound.
   These activities have both long- and short-term effects on the soil part
   of the ecosystem through structural alterations, nutrient accumulation
   and release, with possible enhancement of soil quality. This study
   illustrates the impact of ant foraging activities on the soil and the
   pattern of arrangement existing in soil properties in the mound soil
   environment. Eight active mounds of Iridomyrmex greensladei, greater
   than 50 cm in diameter, were randomly selected from four blocks in a
   vegetation remnant adjacent to the main Wee Waa highway, Narrabri, New
   South Wales. The soil volume, soil mass and slope for each mound was
   characterised. Soil samples were collected in the plots at 0-10 cm depth
   from the top of the mound, the mound perimeter, 5 m radius from the
   mound perimeter, the foraging tracks, and from other locations
   unaffected by ant activity. The soil samples were analysed for physical
   and chemical properties. The extent of pore distribution as cavities and
   galleries, was evaluated by taking photographs of a cross section of an
   ant mound after pouring in water miscible paint (1:8 paint to water
   suspension) into an open cut on the top of the mound. The paint moved
   through the pores, to a depth of about 150-200 cm from the surface
   through vertical and lateral galleries. In comparison to the surrounding
   soil, ant-impacted soils were lower in clay, higher in sand and silt,
   and lower in exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and Na. The top of the mound was
   higher in NO3, P and more compacted than soils not modified by ant
   mounds. Ant-impacted soils had low dispersion indices compared with
   unmodified soil. Ant bioturbation activities increased soil porosity in
   the mounds extending to about 200 cm down the soil profile. Ant
   bioturbation and foraging activities were found to affect soil
   properties beyond the perimeter of the mound and into the surrounding
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter is a major component of biogeochemical cycles and is
   important in maintaining soil quality. We investigated relationships
   between soil organic C and various soil and site properties that may
   influence long-term soil C accumulation across a range of soil orders in
   New Zealand. We used pedon and climatic data for 167 pedons under
   permanent grass, and carried out regression analysis between soil C
   (0-200 mm) contents (t ha(-1)) or concentrations (g kg(-1)) and climatic
   and soil properties, namely, precipitation, temperature, and contents or
   concentrations of sand, silt, clay, pyrophosphate-extractable Al
   (Al-py), Fe oxide, and allophane. Soil clay content or concentration
   explained little of the variation in soil C across all soils (R-2 <
   0.05) and within each soil type. Likewise, mean annual precipitation and
   temperature explained little variation in soil C content or
   concentration (R-2 < 0.15 for precipitation, R-2 = 0.04 for
   temperature). Allophane content or concentration was unrelated to soil C
   in the soils of volcanic origin; Al-py, however, correlated strongly
   with both soil C content and soil C concentration across all soil types
   (R-2 = 0.55 and 0.60, respectively). When all factors were combined in a
   multiple regression analysis, the combination of Al-py and allophane
   contents explained the greatest amount of variation in soil C content
   (R-2 = 0.57), whereas the combination of Al-py, Fe oxide, allophane, and
   clay concentrations explained the greatest amount of variation in soil C
   concentration (R-2 = 0.67). Our results suggest that in New Zealand
   soils, chemical stabilization of organic matter is the keg process
   controlling soil C accumulation, and that clay content relates poorly to
   long-term soil organic C accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{The development of sustainable forestry practices and credible
   certification systems relies on continuous monitoring of indicators. In
   the present study, carried out at the Petawawa Research Forest (Ontario,
   Canada), we evaluated the impacts of three intensive silvicultural
   treatments: scarification, fertilization, and herbicide treatment,
   applied alone or in combination-on indicators of organic layer quality,
   foliar nutrition, and tree growth-10 yr after establishment of eastern
   white pine (Pinus strobus L.) and white spruce {[}Picea glauca (Moench)
   Voss] plantations. We compared these 10-yr results with measurements
   made 3 to 4 yr after plantation establishment. In both 1989 and 1996,
   the herbicide treatment had the greatest effect on organic layer
   quality. In 1996, compared with the no-treatment control, herbicide
   application reduced organic C mass by 46\%, total N mass by 15\%, and
   acid phosphatase activity by 63\%. These negative effects were offset
   when herbicide was applied in combination with fertilizer. The negative
   impart of herbicide on microbial biomass C noted in 1990 was no longer
   evident in 1996. In herbicide-treated plots, the nitrate-dominated cycle
   observed 1989-1990 was replaced by an ammonium-dominated cycle in 1996.
   Although herbicide application negatively affected soil quality, it
   increased tree growth and generally improved foliar nutrition; thus
   organic layer and tree responses were not correlated. The indicators
   used were sensitive to changes in the ecosystem over time and signaled
   soil impacts that could have consequences for long-term productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Much remains to be known concerning the complex relationships between
   specific soil property measurements and overall soil quality. The
   objective of this study was to advance our understanding of these
   complex relationships by further developing and applying a systematic
   method for evaluating the effects of conventional, integrated and
   organic apple production systems on soil physical, chemical, and
   biological properties using a modified soil quality index. This index
   utilizes 1998 soils data from these three treatments. The study used
   four, 0.14 ha replicates of each of the three treatments in a randomized
   complete block design. Experimental plots were planted to `Golden
   Delicious' apples (Malus domestica Borkh.) in 1994 on a commercial
   orchard in the Yakima Valley of Washington state. Organic soil
   management practices included additions of composted poultry manure and
   bark mulches and the use of mechanical tillage for weed control.
   Conventional soil management practices included additions of synthetic
   fertilizers and the use of herbicides for weed control. The integrated
   system utilized practices from each of the other two systems. Increased
   aggregate stability, microbial biomass, and earthworm abundance were
   associated with improved soil quality under integrated management when
   compared to conventional management in 1998. Organic management resulted
   in lower soil bulk densities and generally improved biological soil
   properties compared to conventional management. Few significant
   differences in soil properties were measured between the integrated and
   organic systems. The integrated production system received a soil
   quality index rating of 0.92 (out of 1.00), which was significantly
   higher than the index rating of 0.78 for the conventional production
   system; the organic production system received a rating of 0.88, which
   was not significantly different from the other two systems. The study
   indicates that a well-developed soil quality index can provide an
   effective framework for evaluating the overall effects of different
   orchard production practices on soil quality. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Soil health is the capacity of soil to function as a vital living
   system, within ecosystem and land-use boundaries, to sustain plant and
   animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and
   promote plant and animal health. Anthropogenic reductions in soil
   health, and of individual components of soil quality, are a pressing
   ecological concern. A conference entitled `Soil Health: Managing the
   Biological Component of Soil Quality' was held was held in the USA in
   November 1998 to help increase awareness of the importance and utility
   of soil organisms as indicators of soil quality and determinants of soil
   health. To evaluate sustainability of agricultural practices, assessment
   of soil health using various indicators of soil quality is needed. Soil
   organism and biotic parameters (e.g, abundance, diversity, food web
   structure, or community stability) meet most of the five criteria for
   useful indicators of soil quality. Soil organisms respond sensitively to
   land management practices and climate. They are well correlated with
   beneficial soil and ecosystem functions including water storage,
   decomposition and nutrient cycling, detoxification of toxicants, and
   suppression of noxious and pathogenic organisms. Soil organisms also
   illustrate the chain of cause and effect that links land management
   decisions to ultimate productivity and health of plants and animals.
   Indicators must be comprehensible and useful to land managers, who are
   the ultimate stewards of soil quality and soil health. Visible organisms
   such as earthworms, insects, and molds have historically met this
   criterion. Finally, indicators must be easy and inexpensive to measure,
   but the need for knowledge of taxonomy complicates the measurement of
   soil organisms. Several farmer-participatory programs for managing soil
   quality and health have incorporated abiotic and simple biotic
   indicators. The challenge for the future is to develop sustainable
   management systems which are the vanguard of soil health; soil quality
   indicators are merely a means towards this end. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{While soil quality encompasses physical and chemical besides biological
   characteristics, soil health is primarily an ecological characteristic.
   Ecosystem health has been defined in terms of ecosystem stability and
   resilience in response to a disturbance or stress. We therefore, suggest
   that indicators for soil health could be found by monitoring responses
   of the soil microbial community to the application of different stress
   factors at various intensities. The amplitude of a response and time to
   return to the current state before application of stress could serve as
   measures of soil health. Root pathogens are an integral part of soil
   microbial communities, and the occurrence of epiphytotics forms an
   indication of an ecosystem in distress. Disease suppression can be
   viewed as a manifestation of ecosystem stability and health. Thus,
   indicators for soil health could possibly also function as indicators
   for disease suppressiveness. Previously suggested indicators for soil
   health and disease suppression have mainly been lists of variables that
   were correlated to more or less disturbed soils (ranging from
   conventional to organic agricultural soils, grassland and forest soils)
   or to conduciveness to disease. We suggest a systematic ecological
   approach to the search for indicators for soil health and disease
   suppression, namely, measuring biological responses to various stress
   factors and the time needed to return to the current state. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Soil microorganisms play important roles in soil quality and plant
   productivity. The development of effective methods for studying the
   diversity, distribution, and behavior of microorganisms in soil habitats
   is essential for a broader understanding of soil health. Traditionally,
   the analysis of soil microbial communities has relied on culturing
   techniques using a variety of culture media designed to maximize the
   recovery of diverse microbial populations. However, only a small
   fraction (<0.1\%) of the soil microbial community has been accessible
   with this approach. To overcome these problems, other methods such as
   the analysis of phospholipid fatty acids and community-level
   physiological profiles have been utilized in an attempt to access a
   greater proportion of the soil microbial community. in recent years,
   molecular methods for soil microbial community analysis have provided a
   new understanding of the phylogenetic diversity of microbial communities
   in soil. Among the most useful of these methods are those in which small
   subunit rRNA genes are amplified from soil-extracted nucleic acids.
   Using these techniques, it is possible to characterize and study soil
   microbes that currently cannot be cultured. Microbial rRNA genes can be
   detected directly from soil samples and sequenced. These sequences can
   then be compared with those from other known microorganisms.
   Additionally, group- and taxon-specific oligonucleotide probes can be
   developed from these sequences making direct visualization of
   microorganisms in soil habitats possible. The use of these techniques
   provides new ways of assessing soil microbial diversity and ultimately,
   a more complete understanding of the potential impacts of environmental
   processes and human activities on responses of soil microorganisms.
   Information gained from such studies will have direct impacts on our
   understanding of the role of microbial processes in soil health. (C)

Abstract = {{Various cultural practices, including the use of cover and rotational
   crops, composts, tillage systems, and others have been promoted as
   management options for enhancing soil quality and health. All cultural
   practices are known to directly or indirectly affect populations of
   soilborne pathogens and the severity of their resultant root diseases.
   Soil biology is a major component and contributes significantly to soil
   quality and productivity. The major activities of soil microbes include
   the decomposition of organic materials, mineralization of nutrients,
   nitrogen fixation, suppression of crop pests and protection of roots,
   but also parasitism and injury to plants. Thus, there is a great need to
   assure that the introduced soil management practices to improve soil
   quality will also result and maintain a healthy soil. The latter include
   the abundance and diversity of total soil microbes, high population of
   beneficial organisms and low population and/or activities of crop pests.
   Production of vegetables and other food crops is often significantly
   affected by several soilborne pathogens that require control. The
   incidence and severity of root diseases is an indirect assessment of
   soil health for specific commodity/soil use. In addition, understanding
   and selecting the appropriate cultural practices that limit or prevent
   damage of root diseases is essential for the long-term and sustainable
   management of soil quality and health. Case-study examples are presented
   to illustrate the impact of cover crops and their green manures on the
   density and damage of root-knot and lesion nematodes to vegetables; and
   also tillage, soil amendments, crop rotation, and cover crops on bean
   yield and root rot severity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Soil quality is not a purchased technology; instead, it is a concept
   that can be used in making land management decisions. Researchers have
   generally agreed upon the soil properties that determine soils' capacity
   to function and have emphasized that soil quality must be understood in
   context. Soil quality research has included the following: (1) soil
   management research, where the effects of management on soil properties
   and dependent processes are assessed; (2) measurement development for
   soil quality assessment to be carried out by the farmers themselves, by
   advisors, or consultants and (3) systems assessments, that consider the
   physical and cultural contexts that impact soil quality decision-making.
   Because stewards of the land ultimately determine whether soil quality
   is improved, maintained, or diminished, many research projects in the US
   have included the active participation of fanners in efforts to develop
   the soil quality concept. More effort has been spent on soil management
   and on the development and testing of farmer oriented measurements than
   on system assessments. There is growing consensus that the development
   of soil quality assessments to be used by farmers to solve problems
   within individual fields will be challenging. Organic matter and organic
   matter-dependent properties are the most promising indicators for use in
   a soil quality assessment where the information will be used in
   management decisions. Unfortunately, the successful development of
   on-farm measures may not be sufficient to guarantee that soil quality is
   maintained because there is a mismatch in the temporal and physical
   scales over which soil quality and farm security are achieved.
   Educational materials that highlight soil contributions to farm,
   landscape and global functioning coupled with dialoguing between
   practitioners, scientists, and policy-makers can communicate the
   importance of soil quality to sustainability. Successful soil quality
   efforts will relate soil properties to soil function in a way that
   fosters stewardship among individuals and builds public support for
   polices that promote soil management to ensure agriculture, industry,
   and the natural environment are sustained. Strategies and priorities are
   expected to vary according to audience, land-use constraints and the
   intended scale of application (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Soil quality appears to be an ideal indicator of sustainable land
   management. Soil is the foundation for nearly all land uses. Soil
   quality, by definition, reflects the capacity to sustain plant and
   animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and
   promote plant and animal health. By reflecting the basic capacity of the
   soil to function, it integrates across many potential uses. Nonetheless,
   few land managers have adopted soil quality as an indicator of
   sustainable land management. There are a number of constraints to
   adoption. Most could be overcome through a concerted effort by the
   research community. Specifically, we need to address the following
   issues: (1) demonstrate causal relationships between soil quality and
   ecosystem functions, including biodiversity conservation, biomass
   production and conservation of soil and water resources. True
   calibration of soil quality requires more than merely comparing values
   across management systems; (2) increase the power of soil quality
   indicators to predict response to disturbance. Although then are many
   indicators that reflect the current capacity of a soil to function,
   there are few that can predict the capacity of the soil to continue to
   function under a range of disturbance regimes. Both resistance and
   resilience need to be considered; (3) Increase accessibility of
   monitoring systems to land managers. Many existing systems are too
   complex, too expensive, or both; (4) Integrate soil quality with other
   biophysical and socio-economic indicators. Effective early-warning
   monitoring systems will require not just the inclusion of both
   biophysical and socio-economic indicators, but also the development of
   models that incorporate feedbacks between soil quality and
   socio-economic conditions and trends and (5) Place soil quality in a
   landscape context. Most ecosystem functions depend on connections
   through time across different parts of the landscape. In conclusion,
   soil quality is a necessary but not sufficient indicator of sustainable
   land management. Its value will continue to increase as limitations are
   diminished through collaboration between scientists, land managers and
   policymakers. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Seeding of introduced forage grasses, such as crested wheatgrass
   {[}Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. and A. desertorum (Fisch.) Schult.],
   can lead to the reduction of species diversity and soil quality. This
   study evaluated the effects of crested wheatgrass on soil and vegetation
   relative to native rangeland dominated by bluebunch wheatgrass
   {[}Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) Scribn. \& Smith] under ungrazed
   conditions. Three sites consisting of adjacent ungrazed stands of
   crested wheatgrass and native vegetation were sampled in June 1997.
   Total plant cover was 37\% on native and 24\% on crest ed wheatgrass
   rangeland. Species richness was lower for crested wheatgrass than for
   native rangeland. Quantities of root biomass and most soil properties
   were similar for the two rangelands. Native rangeland had a more stable
   soil structure with 1.7 mm mean weight diameter (MWD) and 38\% of soil
   aggregates in the 2-6 mm size fraction compared to 1.4 mm MWD and 28\%
   of soil aggregate in the 2-6 mm size fraction on crested wheatgrass
   rangeland. Greater soil penetration resistance was observed at the 6 and
   7.5 cm depths for crested wheatgrass rangeland. Crested wheatgrass did
   not invade adjacent native rangelands and only a slight reduction in
   soil quality was observed on crested wheatgrass rangelands.}},

Abstract = {{There is little quantitative information on the interrelatedness of soil
   erosion, sail quality and soil productivity. A simulated erosion
   approach was used to quantify erosion and amendment effects on soil
   quality and subsequent productivity at four southern Alberta sites.
   Zero, 5, 10, 15 and 20 cm of topsoil were removed (cuts) at each site
   and subplots were amended with N + P fertilizer, 5 cm topsoil, 70 Mg
   ha(-1) cattle manure or left unamended. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
   yields in the 2-yr study on the non-amended check plots showed
   significant correlations with organic C at three of the four sites, and
   extractable P and inorganic C at all four sites. While manure was the
   best amendment for enhancing soil productivity, the magnitude of its
   effect depended on the organic C content of the recipient soil. At an
   organic C content of 8 g kg(-1) on the Lethbridge Dryland site, manure
   addition increased crop yield by 1.75 Mg ha(-1), compared with only 0.27
   Mg ha(-1) at an organic C content of 15 g kg(-1). Our results affirm the
   benefits of soil management practices that reduce erosion risk, preserve
   soil quality and sustain productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Deer densities in forests of eastern North America are thought to have
   significant effects on the abundance and diversity of forest birds
   through the role deer play in structuring forest understories. We tested
   the ability of deer to affect forest bird populations by monitoring the
   density and diversity of vegetation and birds for 9 years at eight 4-ha
   sites in northern Virginia, four of which were fenced to exclude deer.
   Both the density and diversity of understory woody plants increased
   following deer exclosure. The numerical response of the shrubs to deer
   exclosure was significantly predicted by the soil quality (ratio of
   organic carbon to nitrogen) at the sites. Bird populations as a whole
   increased following exclosure of deer, particularly for ground and
   intermediate canopy species. The diversity of birds did not increase
   significantly following exclosure of deer, however, primarily because of
   replacement of species as understory vegetation proceeded through
   successional processes. Changes in understory vegetation accounted for
   most of the variability seen in the abundance and diversity of bird
   populations. Populations of deer in protected areas are capable of
   causing significant shifts in the composition and abundance of bird
   communities. These shifts can be reversed by increasing the density and
   diversity of understory vegetation, which can be brought about by
   reducing deer density.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the perceptions and realities of land degradation in a
   communal ranching area, Qtjimbingwe, in arid Namibia (in south-western
   Africa). It is commonly perceived that large-scale degradation of
   Otjimbingwe has occurred due to a mixture of improper pastoral practices
   and pressures induced by a high human population growth rate. We sought
   to determine whether the inhabitants perceived land degradation to have
   taken place and whether their perceptions were consistent with empirical
   data on environmental quality. Furthermore, we wished to determine
   whether these pastoralists had management strategies to help them
   withstand the harsh environmental conditions in which they live. All
   respondents in our surveys perceived that the environment had become
   degraded. The claimed source of this degradation, a decline in annual
   rainfall, is inconsistent with long-term rainfall records (there was
   neither change nor cyclicity in rainfall over time). There is also
   little evidence of a decline in plant cover and soil quality in spite of
   the very high stocking densities. No overall pastoral strategy exists in
   Otjimbingwe. Options for management are extremely limited due to a
   variety of external and internal pressures such as a high human
   population growth rate, high immigration into Otjimbingwe, restricted
   water availability due to darns constructed upstream, and limited
   movement opportunities for livestock in drought periods. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Dehydrogenase (DHA), acid (SPA) and alkaline (APA) phosphomonesterase
   activities in the casts of Dendrobaena octaedra were analysed while the
   animals were offered one of six different food sources. The food
   consisted of air dried leaves of dandelion, lupin, rye, alder, beech and
   larch. The food consumption rate of the earthworms lay between 11.1 mg
   (dandelion) and 0.3 mg d.w. g(-1) f w d(-1) (larch) while the cast
   production varied between 252 mg (dandelion) and 835 mg d.w. g(-1) f.w.
   d(-1) (beech). A deterioration of the food quality caused a reduction of
   the food consumption rate, but simultaneously the mean turnover rate of
   soil aggregates was enhanced. The enzyme activities were influenced by
   the food which affected the specific nutrient state of the casts. DHA,
   SPA and APA were significantly correlated with the organic C and the
   total N content of the casts. Interenzymatic correlations illustrated
   the applicability of the three enzyme activities as useful indicators of
   the influence of earthworms and their food on soil quality. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Developing effective management strategies that restore degraded soils
   requires an evaluation of the quality of the litter residues. This study
   relates the chemical composition of the biomass components to the
   decomposition rates for Piliostigma reticulatum (DC.) Hochst., a native
   shrub, under field and laboratory conditions. The rates were determined
   by mass loss. The changes in the specific surface area of the residue in
   relation to mass loss ranged from 15 X 10(-5) to 45 X 10(-5) which was
   similar to crop residues in other studies. At field conditions, P.
   reticulatum mass loss was higher (80\% of the initial mass lost over
   eight months) than that under controlled conditions (50\%). Such fast
   decomposition of residues others the potential for farmers to stop
   burning these residues because high amounts of residues will not likely
   accumulate and cause interference with tillage and planting operations.
   Further studies are needed on the role of soil fauna on decomposition,
   mineralization of nutrients from these residues, and the potential for
   incorporating residues into the system without burning.}},

   soil quality. Soil microbial diversity is one of many possible factors.
   Our objective was to compare the functional diversity of microbial
   communities in the A horizons of cultivated and uncultivated vertisols
   in NW New South Wales. Samples from two cultivated and two uncultivated
   sites were tested using the community level physiological profiles
   (CLPP) method. Substrate richness, the rate of substrate use and the
   diversity of substrate use, as measured by the Shannon index, were
   significantly larger in the uncultivated sites than in the cultivated
   sites. The CLPP also indicated a higher rate of substrate use in the
   uncultivated sites, although this may have been due to greater initial
   inoculum densities. When diversity values for each site were compared
   with several soil physical and chemical properties, a relationship
   between organic carbon and functional diversity was apparent. The fit to
   a broken-stick model showed that diversity increased up to 1.76\%
   organic carbon and remained constant above that value. The implications
   of these results for soil quality will depend upon future investigations
   on the significance of soil microbial diversity as a component of soil
   quality. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil salinity is a very common problem in today's irrigated agriculture.
   High salinity levels adversely impact crop yields and reduce overall
   soil quality. The presence of a saline shallow water table can be a
   major contributor to this problem. The LEACHC version of LEACHM is one
   of the few numerical models that considers independent movement of
   individual ions along with their detailed chemistry. This model has
   apparently not previously been tested under saline shallow water table
   conditions. LEACHC was evaluated using both lysimeter and field data
   from the literature. The model performed reasonably well in simulating
   solute transport above a saline shallow water table. For both data sets
   used in model validation, less reactive ions (sodium and chloride) were
   predicted well while calcium concentrations were underpredicted. For the
   field data, the model predicted soil electrical conductivity (EC)
   profiles better than most of the individual ions. The water content
   profiles associated with the field data were also predicted quite well.
   Based on these results, LEACHC was selected as a simulation tool for
   evaluating the effects of management practices on salinity transport in
   crop root zones above a saline shallow water table.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of converting native prairie to simplified agronomic
   communities on primary production and soil quality are expected to
   differ over the short-term. A study was initiated at 4 locations: a
   Mixed Prairie with Stipa comata Trin. \& Rupr. dominant in the Brown
   Soil Zone (1994), a Mixed Prairie with S. comata and S. viridula Trin.
   dominant in the Dark Brown Soil Zone (1993), and 2 in the Fescue Prairie
   with Festuca campestris Rydb. dominant in the Black Soil Zone (1993). At
   each of the 4 sites, 5 treatments representing common production systems
   were seeded as monocultures {[}2 grass species, alfalfa (Medicago sativa
   L. `Beaver'), and 2 spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. `Katepwa) seeded
   as either continuous or as wheat-fallow], and 1 treatment consisting of
   abandoned cultivation were compared with a native community in a
   randomized complete block design with 4 replicates. One site in the
   Black Soil Zone was an overgrazed prairie (2.4 animal unit month ha(-1)
   since 1949) and a second was mostly ungrazed for the previous 50 years
   with occasional light fall-grazing. Soils of the modified communities
   were different (P < 0.05) than of the native community with respect to
   percent carbon and nitrogen, concentration of monosaccharides, and
   concentration of most phosphorus constituents. Modifying the community
   through cultivation and seeding usually caused a reduction in the
   measured variable except for NaHCO3 inorganic phosphorus that increased.
   Cultivation rather than the plants of the new community was believed
   responsible for most of the observed changes in C, N, and various P
   fractions and the loss of water-stable aggregates remaining on the 2.0
   and 1.0 mm sieves. Although the contribution of seeded species on the
   chemical and physical characteristics would not have been significantly
   expressed in 2 to 3 years and many more years would be required to reach
   a steady state, monosaccharide distribution had nevertheless started to
   shift to one that was plant-affected.}},

   Mg ha(-1) season(-1)) on soil physical properties and growth and yield
   of maize (Zen mays). Mulch rate of rice straw significantly increased
   maize grain and stover yields during the first season, and the stover
   yield during the second season. In comparison with the control, the
   grain yield increased by 20 per cent at 2 Mg ha(-1) of mulch rate and by
   33 per cent at 8 Mg ha(-1) of mulch rate. The rate of increase was 0.16
   Mg ha(-1) for grain yield and 0.38 Mg ha(-1) for stover yield for every
   Mg of mulch applied. The increase in stover yield during the second
   season was 67 per cent for 8 Mg ha(-1) mulch rate compared with the
   unmulched control. Effects of mulch rate on soil physical properties
   were confined mostly to the surface 0-5 cm depth. For this depth,
   mulching decreased bulk density from 1.17 Mg m(-3) for control to 0.98
   Mg m(-3), and penetration resistance from 1.54 kg cm(-2) to 1.07 kg
   cm(-2) for 8 Mg ha(-1) of mulch rate. Application of mulch up to 16 Mg
   ha(-1) yr(-1) for three consecutive years had no effect on soil physical
   properties below 5 cm depth. Experiments were probably not conducted for
   a long enough period. For mulch farming to be adopted by farmers of West
   Africa, it must be an integral part of the improved farming system.

Abstract = {{One of the major interests in soil analysis is the evaluation of its
   chemical, physical and biological parameters, which are indicators of
   soil quality (the most important is the organic matter). Besides there
   is a great interest in the study of humic substances and on the
   assessment of pollutants, such as pesticides and heavy metals, in soils.
   Chemometrics is a powerful tool to deal with these problems and can help
   soil researchers to extract much more information from their data. In
   spite of this, the presence of these kinds of strategies in the
   literature has obtained projection only recently. The utilization of
   chemometric methods in soil analysis is evaluated in this article. The
   applications will be divided in four parts (with emphasis in the first
   two): (i) descriptive and exploratory methods based on Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA); (ii) multivariate calibration methods (MLR,
   PCR and PLS); (iii) methods such as Evolving Factor Analysis and
   SIMPLISMA; and (iv) artificial intelligence methods, such as Artificial
   Neural Networks.}},

Abstract = {{A laboratory experiment was carried out to study soil quality
   amelioration through ``in situ{''} vermicomposting of biological
   sludges. The experiment dealt with the stabilization, through the action
   of worms (Eisenia fetida), of five mixtures containing aerobic and
   anaerobic biological sludges spread on the soil surface. The results
   showed that by increasing the percentage of anaerobic sludge in the
   mixtures, the number of worms which left the sludge and chose the soil
   as their habitat increased. The chemico-structural changes of the
   sludges left on the soil surface by worms were evaluated through the
   technique of pyrolysis-gas chromatography, which showed that the degrees
   of mineralization and humification of organic matter were dependent on
   the composition of the sludge mixtures. When the amount of aerobic
   sludge in the mixtures was higher than 50\%, a stimulation of soil
   microbial metabolism occurred, as demonstrated by the index of metabolic
   potential (defined by dehydrogenase/water soluble carbon ratio). All
   treatments increased the percentage of soil total shrinkage area, mostly
   due to the formation of cracks of small-medium size (< 1000 mu m), which
   represent a favourable site for microbiological and biochemical
   processes in the soil. A positive statistical correlation between soil
   dehydrogenase activity, C and N substrates, and cracks of small-medium
   size was found. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Forage crops and soil attributes were evaluated for 4 years at three
   sites in Alaska. Annual herbage yields usually exceeded 5 Mg ha(-1) on
   neutral soils at Fairbanks (64 degrees 52' W) and on moderately acidic
   soils at Point MacKenzie (61 degrees 24' N, 150 degrees3' W). Strongly
   acidic, droughty soils at Delta Junction (63 degrees 55' N, 145 degrees
   20' W) produced low yields for all crops. Soil pH decreased
   significantly over 4 years under N-fertilized grasses at Delta Junction
   and under alfalfa and N-fertilized barley at Fairbanks. Soil organic C
   and N and microbial biomass C showed no differences among treatments at
   the end of the study. Wet aggregate stability did not vary significantly
   among crops but was lower for fallow. The results of this study
   indicated a high potential for use of perennial forage legumes at some
   locations in Alaska. The lack of large differences in most soil
   parameters indicates slow responsiveness to management by some commonly
   used soil-quality indicators under subarctic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Surface runoff and sediment transport influence soil quality and the
   quality of receiving waters. Simulation models are useful tools to
   describe drainage behavior and sediment yield to develop management
   strategies for agricultural waters. The objective of this study was to
   investigate the performance of the Agricultural Non-Point Source
   Pollution Model (AGNPS) and modified versions comparing measured and
   predicted surface runoff and sediment yield at the drainage outlet. The
   study was carried out using 52 rainfall-runoff events from two small
   watersheds in Bavaria, 22 for calibration and 30 for validation.
   Evaluation of model outputs was based on graphical displays contrasting
   measured and predicted values for each rainfall-runoff event, and
   standard statistics such as coefficient of efficiency. A comparison
   between three different surface runoff methods el (uncalibrated curve
   number (CN) method), Q(2) (calibrated CN method), and Q(3) (Lutz method)
   showed that the uncalibrated CN method underestimated measured surface
   runoff considerable, while the Lutz method outperformed the calibrated
   CN method and was better than the uncalibrated CN method. The
   modifications made to sediment yield calculations encompassed: (i)
   replacement of the Universal Soil Loss Equation LS factor algorithm by
   one based on stream power theory (variant S-2), and (ii) linkage of
   channel erosion by individual categories of particle-size to runoff
   velocity (variant S-3) The sediment yield predictions by S-2 and S-3
   outperformed the predictions of S-1 (USLE). Calculations based on S-3
   gave the best agreement when compared to measured sediment yield values
   at the drainage outlet. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Food security in the East African Highlands is dependent upon the
   productivity of lands managed by smallholders who face difficult
   challenges in maintaining the fertility of their soils. A study was
   conducted to identify indicators of soil fertility status that are
   consistent with farmers' perceptions of soil fertility. Physical,
   chemical and biological properties of soils were measured from paired
   fields identified as either productive or non-productive by 12 farmers
   and compared to findings of a household survey on soil fertility
   management. Special attention was given to the potential of different
   soil organic matter fractions to serve as diagnostic indicators of soil
   fertility. Farmers' criteria for distinguishing soil productivity
   included crop performance, soil tilth, moisture and colour and presence
   of weeds and soil invertebrates. All farmers attributed low fertility to
   inadequate use of organic and inorganic fertilisers (100\%) and removal
   of crop residues (100\%). Other causes included continuous cropping
   (83\%), lack of crop rotation (66\%) and soil erosion (42\%). Productive
   soils had significantly higher soil pH, effective cation exchange
   capacity, exchangeable cations, extractable P and total N and P than
   non-productive soils. Total organic C and several estimates of soil
   labile C including particulate organic C (POC), three Ludox density
   separates of POC, KMnO4-oxidizable C and microbial biomass C were
   significantly greater in productive soils. Soil microbial biomass N, net
   N mineralisation and soil respiration were also significantly higher in
   productive soils. Farmers' perceptions of soil quality were
   substantiated through soil chemical analyses and soil organic matter
   fractions provided precise information on these differences. The
   similarity of soil physical properties in productive and non-productive
   fields suggests that differences in chemical and biological indicators
   may have resulted, in part, from smallholders' management and are not
   inherent properties of the soils. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Human population pressures upon land resources have increased the need
   to assess impacts of land use change on soil quality. In order to assess
   effects of land use changes on soil quality properties in a tropical
   forest ecosystem of Bangladesh, soil samples were collected from
   adjacent well-stocked Shorea robusta natural forest, land reforested
   with Acacia, grassland and cultivated land. Land use/land cover changes
   (degradation of natural forest and subsequent cultivation of soils)
   resulted in surface compaction and significant decreases in silt and
   clay contents, porosity and aggregate stability, N, fulvic and labile C,
   and microbial biomass C. Maintenance respiration rates increased in
   comparison to the soils under natural forest. Use of soil deterioration
   index showed that soil quality deteriorated significantly (-44\%) under
   cultivation, while in sites revegetated with fast-growing Acacia or
   grasses, it improved by 6-16\%. Degradation of soil quality may have
   resulted from increased disruption of macroaggregates, reductions in
   microbial biomass, and loss of labile organic matter due to fire,
   deforestation, tillage and accelerated erosion. Improvement in soil
   quality and enhanced biological activity at reforested and grassland
   sites demonstrated the inherent resilience of these soils once
   revegetated with highly adaptable and fast growing Acacia (Acacia sp.)
   and grass species. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In most studies of fungal-bacterial communities in soils, single-value
   indices such as fumigation-extraction (FE) of microbe-derived organic
   carbon, measures of specific microbial cell chemical constituents, or
   activity-related measures have been used. These widely used single value
   indices, however, do not provide information on the physical structure
   of the filamentous fungal and bacterial community in a soil. The
   filamentous fungi, considered as indeterminate organisms, have a
   variable and changing hyphal network, most of which is devoid of
   cytoplasm. To meet this need for a direct integrated measure of the
   physical characteristics of the indeterminate fungi and their associated
   bacteria, a microscopy-based microbial biovolumes ratios approach is
   suggested. To provide this information, the total and active biovolumes
   of both the filamentous fungi and bacteria are assessed by microscopy.
   To normalize these responses, the ratio of total to active (TA) fungal
   plus bacterial biovolumes is divided by the ratio of the active fungal
   to bacterial biovolume (AFB), to yield the total/active/active
   fungal/bacterial (TA/AFB) biovolumes ratio. This approach has been used
   to analyze data from recently-cultivated early successional (ES) and
   uncultivated late successional (LS) sites at a shortgrass steppe of
   northeastern Colorado, where control plots were compared with those
   receiving mineral nitrogen amendments, using samples taken during the
   summer of 1995. The TA/AFB ratio index showed distinct and significant
   decreases in response to soil disturbance which reflected the decreased
   hyphal lengths present in these disturbed soils. These changes were not
   detected by the use of FE-based extractable carbon measurements. The
   TA/AFB ratio also showed significant positive correlations with indices
   of plant community development and mineral nitrogen, especially in the
   plots not amended with N. This TA/AFB ratios index should be able to
   provide information on the physical structure of the indeterminate
   filamentous fungi and associated soil bacteria for use in the assessment
   of soil quality, health and resiliency. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Land productivity, along with improvement or maintenance of soil health,
   must be evaluated together to achieve sustainable agricultural
   practices. Winter wheat-fallow (W-F) has been the prevalent cropping
   system in the central Great Plains for 60 years where moisture is a
   limitation to crop production. Alternative cropping systems show that
   producers can crop more frequently if residue management and minimum
   tillage are used. The impact of different crops, crop rotations and
   tillage management practices on soil quality was assessed by measuring
   aggregate stability and glomalin production by arbuscular mycorrhizal
   (AM) fungi in soil from cropping trials established in 1990. Crops were
   wheat (W), corn (C), prose millet (M), and sunflower (S). Rotations
   sampled were W-F, W-C-M, W-C-M-F, W-C-F, and W-S-F. In the same area as
   the cropping trials, soils were taken from a perennial grass (crested
   wheatgrass) and from a buffer area that had been planted to Triticale
   for the past 2 years but prior to that had been extensively plowed for
   weed control. We found that aggregate stability and glomalin were
   linearly correlated (r=0.73, n=54, P<0.001) across all treatments
   sampled. Highest and lowest aggregate stability and glomalin values were
   seen in perennial grass and Triticale soils, respectively. Aggregate
   stability in W-S-F was significantly lower than in the other crop
   rotations (P less than or equal to 0.03), while W-C-M had significantly
   higher glomalin than the other rotations (P<0.05). Differences between
   crop rotations and the perennial grass indicate that selected
   comparisons should be studied in greater detail to determine ways to
   manage AM fungi to increase glomalin and aggregate stability in these
   soils.}},

Abstract = {{The authors present a framework that illustrates how a resource quality
   index can be used to examine policy relevant questions regarding
   environmental condition, the management of a resource as a production
   output, and sustainability. The framework demonstrates that
   heterogeneous endowments of a resource can change over time in different
   ways. By evaluating these changes using substitution, reversibility and
   uncertainty criteria, we can suggest four general guidelines for
   managing an environmental resource in a single production process. This
   framework was applied in a case study to three soil types (stable,
   neutral and susceptible) used in agricultural production in the
   Midwestern United States. By evaluating the economic and environmental
   impacts of managing soil quality under different sustainability and
   profit objectives, we uncovered policy relevant information including:
   which soils need to be preserved; when public intervention is needed to
   attain sustainability; and what perceptions of sustainability may be
   worth pursuing at all. The accuracy of these insights is highly
   dependent upon the reliability of the assessment of resource quality. An
   index was useful in this resource assessment because it could adapt to
   many of the complexities of environmental condition. We offer three
   lessons in refining resource indicators so that they may be used in the
   framework to better achieve optimal resource management and a greater
   understanding of what sustainability really means. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recently, environmental quality standards (EQSs) that include background
   concentrations for metals have been set in The Netherlands. These EQSs
   are based on environmental risk limits and applying the added risk
   approach. The added risk approach was developed to incorporate the
   background concentration of naturally occurring substances such as
   metals in environmental risk limits. The original approach discriminates
   between the bioavailable and unavailable fraction and calculates a
   permissible concentration that can be added to a background
   concentration, i.e., the maximum permissible addition (MPA). This MPA
   includes the effects caused by the bioavailable fraction of the
   background concentration. The new EQSs in The Netherlands assume the
   bioavailable fraction of background metals is mathematically equal to
   zero. The rationale for this assumption is that, from an environmental
   policy perspective, background-related effects that in reality do exist,
   are desirable because they may in theory lead to increased ecosystem
   variability or biodiversity. Moreover, there is little information on
   the bioavailability of background concentrations of metals. This paper
   presents a theoretical exercise in which the effects of varying
   background bioavailability on MPA values for cadmium, copper, lead, and
   zinc in water and soil are evaluated. The results shaw that, for these
   metals, bioavailability does not affect or only slightly affects the
   MPAs. Only the terrestrial MPAs for copper, lead, and zinc are sensitive
   to bioavailability. This minor influence of assumed percentage
   bioavailability on the MPAs, coupled with a policy-driven assumption
   that effects of background concentrations should be ignored, explain the
   current policy in The Netherlands that the bioavailability of background
   concentrations of metals should be assumed to be zero.}},

Abstract = {{This article points out the kinds of problems agriculture is facing,
   outlines and structures agricultural quality components and defined aims
   for them, discusses the shortcomings of organic farming, proposes some
   important research areas and presents an outlook. The quality components
   are a type of checklist of those factors that we should be aware of
   concerning protection of the environment, production of healthy food and
   the practice of good ethics. These components can be integrated into the
   general aims of sustainable agriculture. Many European and other
   countries focus on organic farming as a solution, but this approach is
   dangerous because it does not necessarily lead to a better environment
   or better food products. Concerning future agricultural research, the
   following issues are highly important: precision agriculture, low
   leaching cropping systems, management of soil biological processes and
   maximum recirculation. Finally, the article discusses some issues of
   future agriculture such as intensity, nutrient imbalances caused by
   regional farm specialisation, and the development of an agricultural
   quality assessment system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We present a means to recover information about soil quality trends from
   data sets, such as those from long-term crop experiments, in which time
   series of direct measures of soil properties may be unavailable. The
   first objective of the paper is to develop a method to recover
   information about the evolution of soil quality attributes from a
   limited range of data. The second objective is empirical: focusing on
   the productivity component of soil quality, to apply a dynamic
   statistical estimation method to infer a measure of soil productivity
   and its evolution from a time series of data on yields, nutrient inputs
   and management techniques. The results of the empirical analysis confirm
   well-known input-productivity relationships, but also reveal new
   information about their dynamics. For example, more intensive cropping
   reduces soil productivity, but the dynamic effects of crop choice on
   productivity in a given period decline over time. N fertilizer can
   substitute for soil productivity in the short term, but in the long
   term, soil productivity decline due to intensive cultivation cannot be
   alleviated by higher N application rates. Simulations of soil
   productivity evolution across differing land management regimes reveal
   that continuous cropping of corn rapidly reduces soil productivity even
   at high N application rates, while rotational choices, especially the
   use of legumes, can lead to quite rapid soil productivity regeneration.
   Both our conceptualization of the soil productivity measure and our
   approach to its measurement have the advantage of making use of only
   limited longitudinal data. Our empirical findings convey some important
   implications for future research related to the sustainability of
   agricultural production worldwide. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) in agricultural soils influence
   soil quality and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Land
   use, management practices, soil characteristics, and climate influence
   such changes. Using the Century model we estimated the rate of SOC
   change in agricultural soils of Canada for the period 1970 to 2010. This
   estimation was based on the estimated SOC change for 15\% of the 1250
   agriculturally designated soil landscape of Canada (SLC) polygons.
   Simulations were carried out for two to five crop rotations and for
   conventional and no-tillage. The results indicate that the agricultural
   soils in Canada, whose SOC are currently very close to equilibrium, will
   stop being a net source of CO(2) and will become a sink by the year
   2000. Rates of carbon change for the years 1970, 1990, and 2010 were
   estimated to be -67, -39, and 11 kgC ha(-1) The rate of decline in the
   carbon content of agricultural soils in Canada has slowed considerably
   in the 1990s as a result of an increase in the adoption of no-tillage
   management, a reduction in the use of summer fallowing, and an increase
   in fertilizer application. We estimate that the proportion of
   agricultural land storing SOC will have increased from 17\% in 1990 to
   53\% by the year 2000.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of sustainable development suggests that soil quality should

   properties of native soils under climax vegetation. The most relevant
   properties are biochemical. We describe the general biochemical
   parameters of the O and Ah horizons of 40 native Umbrisols under climax
   Atlantic oakwood in Galicia (NW Spain). The properties studied were:
   microbial biomass C (O horizons 1935 +/- 450 mg C kg(-1), Ah horizons
   781 +/- 753 mg C kg(-1)), N flush (68 +/- 20 and 26 +/- 13 mg kg(-1)),
   soil respiration (12.9 +/- 4.5 and 2.6 +/- 0.8 mu g CO2-C g(-1) h(-1)),
   ATP (8.91 +/- 3.20 and 2.77 +/- 1.38 mu g g(-1)), dehydrogenase activity
   (555 +/- 205 and 207 +/- 58 nmol INTF g(-1) h(-1)), catalase activity

   and arginine ammonification rate (11.1 +/- 5.9 and 4.9 +/- 2.2 mu g
   N-NH4+ g(-1) h(-1)). The values reported are generally within the ranges

Abstract = {{Agricultural production systems have to combine management practices in
   order to sustain soil quality and also profitability. We investigated
   microbial biomass and size-density fractions of soils from a long-term
   field trial set up in 1978 at Therwil, Switzerland. It compares the
   economic and ecological performance of organic and conventional
   agricultural systems. Main differences of the systems were the amount
   and form of fertiliser as well as the plant protection strategy, whilst
   crop rotation and soil tillage were the same. Microbial biomass C and N
   as well as their ratios to the total and light fraction C and N pools in
   soils of the organic systems were higher than in conventional systems.
   This is interpreted as an enhanced decomposition of the easily available
   light fraction pool of soil organic matter (SOM) with increasing amounts
   of microbial biomass. The role of microbial biomass as a regulator and
   light fraction organic matter as an indicator of decomposition is
   discussed. The presented results indicate that labile pools of SOM are
   distinctly affected by long-term management practices. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L) production has increased in the central
   Great Plains, but Little is known regarding how this crop will affect
   surface biomass production, various soil quality indicators, and
   subsequent winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields. We hypothesized
   that sunflower production was reducing soil quality relative to other
   summer crops because of the need for tillage to incorporate herbicide,
   thus reducing surface residue. Our objectives were to quantify on a Weld
   silt loam (fine, smectitic, mesic, Aridic Argiustolls) surface crop
   residue levels immediately after seeding wheat, subsequent wheat grain
   yield, soil organic carbon (SOC), particulate organic matter-carbon
   (POM-C), aggregate stability, and texture in 3- or 4-year rotation. A
   randomized complete block design with three replications was used to
   compare rotations both with and without sunflower. Our data showed 13\%
   lower SOC content and 26\% lower POM-C content at the 0- to 5-cm depth
   in rotations with sunflower versus those without. At the 5- to 15- cm
   depths, differences were not significant (P < 0.05). Crop residue by
   mass was 5 times lower and wheat yields 33\% lower in rotations with
   sunflower, but no differences were measured for wind erodible aggregates
   or texture. Tillage to incorporate herbicides for sunflower and low
   amounts of residue after sunflower in the 3-year rotation contributed to
   reduced SOC and POM-C, decreased residue at wheat planting, and reduced
   wheat yield. If sunflower is to be included in the central Great Plains,
   efforts should be made to use no-till production practices and 4-year
   rotations with corn.}},

Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{245-266}},

Abstract = {{The soil conditions of an abandoned shunting yard in the Ruhr area were
   studied to find the most important factors influencing plant growth and
   nutrient cycling. The chemical and physical conditions of five Urbic
   Anthrosols with different development histories were compared with those
   of a nearby Calcic Cambisol under agricultural use. In the second half
   of the 19th century, the ground level of the shunting yard site was
   raised about 2 m. The soils are now mainly Regosols, mostly well drained
   in the topsoil. The coarse material contents (> 2 mm), which are up to
   100\% in base layers of railway tracks, and the quality of the man-made
   substrates (crushed rock, slags, ashes, coke) are the most important
   factors influencing plant growth. Poor physical structure and low
   contents of fine fraction (< 2 mm) lead to low water storage. Together
   with a low available nutrient stock, these properties lead to poor
   establishment of vegetation. The burning of coal by steam engines
   produced highly polluted ashes that fill pore spaces in the railway
   ballast layers. All the investigated fine substrata of the shunting yard
   layers exhibit a higher magnetic susceptibility than the rural soil. The
   ashes still contain unburned coal so that, although the total organic C
   content of the man-made soils reaches 37\%, the wide C:N ratio does not
   indicate the actual quality of humic substances. The acid neutralization
   potential of the topsoil layers of the shunting yard will be consumed by
   acidic atmospheric deposition within a few decades, whereas in the
   surrounding Calcic Cambisols, it will take more than a thousand years.
   This may cause further problems of groundwater quality, as the heavy
   metals will become more soluble. The low soil quality makes such sites
   suitable for vegetation species that cannot compete in the surrounding
   very eutrophic agricultural landscape. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Single species can have large effects on entire communities through
   habitat modification and facilitation. I tested the general hypothesis
   that the intertidal grass Spartina alterniflora facilitates the
   establishment and persistence of New England cobble beach plant
   communities by modifying the shoreline environment. This community is
   dominated by halophytic forbs and is restricted to estuarine cobble
   beaches bordered by Spartina. Beds of Spartina can reduce mean water
   velocity by 50\% and maximum velocity by nearly an order of magnitude,
   and they can substantially stabilize the cobble substrate. Specifically,
   I determined the importance of five life history stages (seed supply,
   seed germination, seedling emergence, seedling establishment, and adult
   survival) and four factors (water velocity, substrate stability,
   herbivory, and soil quality) in limiting lateral plant distribution. A
   seed addition experiment demonstrated that seedlings could only emerge
   behind Spartina, suggesting that seedling emergence is the proximate
   life history stage limiting adult distribution. Seed germination and
   adult survival do not appear to be limiting stages, at least in an
   absolute sense. Although seed supply was much greater (similar to
   10-100x) behind Spartina, a substantial number of seeds were caught in
   seed traps placed between beds, suggesting that seed supply also does
   not limit absolute plant distribution. These results are supported by
   the presence of seedlings buried below the substrate surface between
   beds at the time when seedlings are naturally emerging behind beds. A
   manipulative field experiment was performed to test the effects of
   substrate instability, soil quality, and herbivory on seedling emergence
   between beds. Seeds of two annual cobble beach species (Suaeda linearis
   and Salicornia europaea) were added to plots behind Spartina and also
   between beds with and without substrate stabilization manipulations.
   This treatment was designed to stabilize the substrate in a manner that
   would not affect water velocity and soil characteristics or prevent
   access by potential herbivores. When not buffered by Spartina, seedlings
   of both species were only able to emerge and survive when the substrate
   was artificially stabilized. These results indicate that Spartina
   alterniflora facilitates the establishment and persistence of cobble
   beach plant communities by stabilizing the substrate and enabling
   seedlings to emerge and survive.}},

Abstract = {{Indicators of the condition and sustainability of agricultural lands
   covering 5.5 million ha in six mid-Atlantic states were measured in 1994
   and 1995. The primary objective was to collect baseline information
   against which future data from the region ran be compared. Soil samples
   and questionnaire data were collected from a random sample of 293 sites.
   Indicators addressed productivity, management at the agroecosystem
   scale, and management for the landscape scale on annual crop land. Crop
   yields were almost 30\% higher than those of the 1980s, with a mean
   observed to expected yield index of 1.27. The mean soil quality index
   showed moderate quality for supporting plant growth. Non-tilled sites,
   which were mostly hay, had greater microbial biomass than tilled sites.
   Just over half of the annual crop land was covered by rotation plans;
   hay fields accounted for most of the land where one crop was grown
   continuously. Hay showed a lower use of applied nitrogen than seed
   crops. Integrated pest management was practiced on less than 20\% of
   annual crop land. Twenty-seven different annual crops were grown in the
   region, with hay (all types) the dominant crop. Less than 20\% of the
   land where pesticides were applied had high to moderately high potential
   for pesticides leaching into ground water. This information provides a
   baseline for long-term monitoring of agricultural lands in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Burrow systems of two coastal populations (El Alamo and Los Maitenes) of
   the social octodontid rodent Spalncopus cyanus were studied in central
   Chile. Tunnel systems were estimated to be up to 600 m long, ran at a
   depth of 15 cm and had a diameter of 6 cm. Tunnel openings were usually
   unplugged, and a minor preference toward southern and south-eastern
   direction of entrances was apparent. Nests, frequently found in the root
   system of Berberis actinacantha at a depth of 30 cm, consisted of
   grasses, roots and plastic bags. Nests serve for sleep, care of the pups
   and as latrines. Many staphylinid beetles of the genus Edrabius and
   other invertebrates were found in the breeding nests. Food chambers
   contained up to 13.2 kg of bulbs of the geophyte Dioscorea longipes
   collected by a single colony consisting of 26 animals (including 10
   adults) and were frequently found at El Alamo. However, no bulbs were
   found at Los Maitenes, where the coruros forage above ground on leaves
   of Convolvulus arvensis within a radius of about 10 cm of the entrances.
   Apparently, the burrow design is also affected by food availability,
   soil quality, and colony size.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the dynamics of soil C is key to managing soil organic
   matter to enhance soil quality and ecosystem functioning, and reduce
   trace gas emissions from soils. Our objective was to determine the
   source and turnover of C pools in some agricultural soils in eastern
   Canada. Soils from five field experiments under continuous maize
   cropping for 4-37 yr were sampled, and the organic C content and stable
   C isotope (C-13) composition of whole soil and water soluble and
   microbial biomass fractions determined. The C-13 results showed a clear
   distinction between the water soluble organic C and microbial biomass C,
   with the water soluble organic C more like the whole soil and the
   microbial biomass more like the maize residues. A simple linear model
   was used to explore the relationship among the soil organic constituents
   and evaluate the turnover of these carbon pools. Even though the water
   soluble organic C had a higher turnover rate than the microbial biomass
   C, the proportion of C-4-derived C in the biomass was about 2.5 times
   greater than that in water soluble organic C, Apparently the large
   amount of native soil C, the small amount of water soluble organic C,
   and its equilibrium with the native soil C, cause humus to dominate the
   isotopic composition of water soluble organic C even though the water
   soluble C is very active. Our results suggest that the quantity, as well
   as the turnover rate, of soil organic matter constituents that are in
   equilibrium influence the isotopic composition of such constituents.

   normalized stability index (NSI) which (i) compares aggregate
   distribution after slaking and rewetting to characterize whole soil
   stability and eliminate confounding effects of pretreatment and
   antecedent water content, (ii) corrects for the confounding effect of
   differences in sand size distribution among soils, aggregate size
   classes and pretreatments, and (iii) normalizes the level of disruption
   imposed by slaking by using a maximum level of disruption. The NSI was
   tested on three soils dominated by a 2:1 clay mineralogy and one soil
   characterized by a mixed (2:1 and 1:1) clay mineralogy. Each site had
   native vegetation (NV), no-tillage (NT), and conventional tillage (CT)
   treatments. In soils dominated by 2:1 clays, NSI decreased with
   increasing cultivation intensity (NV > NT > CT). However, NSI was higher
   in the soil with mixed clays compared to the other soils and was not
   different along the cultivation gradient. These observations are
   hypothesized to be related to the presence of Fe- and Al-oxides and
   kaolinite. In conclusion, NSI appears to be a good indicator for soil
   structural quality since it is sensitive to changes in agricultural
   practices and it minimizes confounding effects. A decrease of SOM levels
   results in a smaller decrease of soil stability in soils dominated by
   oxides and 1:1 minerals compared to soils dominated by 2:1 minerals.}},

Abstract = {{No-tillage in association with row crop production is generally believed
   to by poorly adapted to fine-textured soils, especially in temperate
   humid climates. The relative success of conservation tillage may be
   impacted by changes in soil structure. The objective of this study is to
   evaluate the performance of reduced tillage systems after rotation from
   a perennial sod crop. An experiment involving spring and fall moldboard
   plow till (PT), no-till (NT)/zone till (ZT), and ridge till (RT) under
   maize (Zea mays L.) production following alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)
   was conducted on a Kingsbury clay loam soil (Gleyic Luvisol) in Northern
   New York. Soil water content, strength and temperature, plant height,
   leaf area and number, leaf, stem and root biomass, and root distribution
   were measured during the 1992 and 1993 growing seasons for spring PT and
   NT, while from 1994 to 1999 only yield measurements were made. Tillage
   in 1992 occurred under adequately dry conditions, but in 1993 under
   partially plastic consistency state, resulting in an underconsolidated
   plow layer. Soil water contents were generally higher for NT than PT in
   1992, but equal in 1993. Root proliferation was good in the subsoil
   although soil strengths were generally above the 2 MPa level, suggesting
   that penetrometer measurements are not a good indicator of rooting
   potential in a well-structured soil. Soil strength was higher in both
   years under NT, and under both tillage treatments was negatively related
   to soil water content, except in the surface layer where soil
   penetrability appears mostly affected by aggregate arrangement. NT
   recorded higher plant heights, leaf area index and leaf numbers in 1993,
   while PT recorded higher per plant leaf area, stem and root biomass.
   Roots were generally more abundant under PT than NT at all depths, and
   were reduced in trafficked inter-row areas. Maize yield was
   significantly higher under PT in 1992, but similar to NT in 1993.
   Further yield data from 1994 to 1999 indicate that reduced tillage
   systems can perform equally or better compared to fall PT on this soil
   type. Spring PT generally yields lower than fall PT, NT/ZT, and RT. In
   general, long-term use of reduced tillage systems is economical on
   well-structured clay loam soils if adequate consideration is given to
   maintaining Soil structure. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Changes to the metabolic profiles of soil microbial communities could
   have potential for use as early indicators of the impact of management
   or other perturbations on soil functioning and soil quality. We compared
   the relative susceptibility to management of microbial community
   metabolism with a number of soil organic matter (OM) and microbial
   parameters currently used as indicators of changes in soil biological
   quality. Following long-term cereal cropping, plots were subjected to a
   16-month treatment period consisting of either a mixed cropping sequence
   of vetch, spring barley and clover or a continuous grass-clover ley
   which was periodically mown and mulched. The treatments had no effect on
   soil biomass N or respiration of microbial populations inoculated into
   Biolog Gram negative (GN) plates. After 16 months there were no
   management-induded changes to total OM, light-fraction OM C and N,
   labile organic N or water-soluble carbohydrates. However, patterns of
   substrate utilization by the soil microbial population following
   inoculation into Biolog GN plates were found to be highly sensitive to
   management practice. In the mixed cropping sequence, substrate
   utilization changed markedly following plough-in of the vetch crop, with
   a smaller change occurring after harvesting of the barley. In the ley
   treatment, substrate utilization was not affected until the onset of
   mowing, when the pattern changed to become similar to that in the mixed
   cropping sequence. Metabolic diversity of the Biolog-culturable
   microbial population was increased by the ley treatment, but was not
   affected by the cropping sequence. We conclude that patterns of
   microbial substrate utilization and metabolic diversity are more
   sensitive to the effects of management than are OM and biomass pools,
   and therefore have value as early indicators of the impacts of
   management on soil biological properties, and hence soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed the effect of eight lime application rates, with
   four field replications, on the activities of 14 enzymes involved in C,
   N, P, and S cycling in soils. The enzymes were assayed at their optimal
   pH values. The soil used was a Kenyon loam located at the Northeast
   Research Center in Nashua, Iowa. Lime was applied in 1984 at rates
   ranging from 0 to 17,920 kg effective calcium carbonate equivalent
   (ha(-1)), and surface samples (0-15 cm) were taken after 7 years.
   Results showed that organic C and N were not significantly affected by
   lime application, whereas the soil pH was increased from 4.9 to 6.9. The
   activities of the following enzymes were assayed: alpha- and
   beta-glucosidases, alpha- and beta-galactosidases, amidase, arylamidase,
   urease, L-glutaminase, L-asparaginase, L-aspartase, acid and alkaline
   phosphatases, phosphodiesterase, and arylsulfatase. With the exception
   of acid phosphatase, which was significantly (P < 0.001) but negatively
   correlated with soil pH (r = -0.69), the activities of all the other
   enzymes were significantly (P < 0.001)and positively correlated with
   soil pH, with r values ranging from 0.53 for the activity of
   alpha-galactosidase to 0.89 for alkaline phosphatase and
   phosphodiesterase. The Delta activity/Delta pH values ranged from 4.4 to
   38.5 for the activities of the glycosidases, from 1.0 to 107 for
   amidohydrolases and arylamidase, 97 for alkaline phosphatase, 39.4 for
   phosphodiesterase, and 11.2 for arylsulfatase. This value for acid

Abstract = {{A pot experiment with step contamination of soil by Ni and As was
   performed over a 2-year period with radish. Two soils were used (heavy
   soil - clay-loam - and light soil - sand-loam) and four levels of
   contamination were selected, based on the natural abundance of the
   elements in these soils. Addition of Ni or As had a different inhibiting
   effect due to the soil quality. With Ni, the biomass production was
   lower in light soil, whereas with As, this reduction of plant growth was
   stronger in heavy soil. The ultrastructure of Ni and As contaminated
   tubers was investigated both in the cortical and vascular bundle cells.
   The cytological study demonstrated that the two pollutants induced
   ultrastructural changes in mitochondria. They were more obvious in the
   vascular tissue than in the cortex and were correlated with the growth
   inhibition observed in both soils. Plant tolerance to Ni and As was
   coherent with the content of the mobile fractions of the two elements in
   soil. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term effect of organic recycling on some aspects of quality in
   a lowland rice soil of an Indian plateau region was studied. The
   experiment was set up at the agricultural experimental farm of the
   Indian Statistical Institute, Giridih, Bihar, India. Two rice cultivars,
   and treatments with four organic supplements (cowdung manure, Leuceana
   leaves, decomposed farm residue and Sesbania), chemical fertilizers
   (urea, superphosphate and muriate of potash) and no input were arranged
   in a factorial randomized block design. Organic supplements improved
   soil quality parameters such as water holding capacity, total organic C,
   microbial biomass C, urease and acid phosphatase activities of soils in
   comparison to chemical fertilizers and no input. Among the organic
   supplements, cowdung manure gave significantly higher organic C
   (1.39\%), microbial biomass C (276.46 mu g g(-1) dry soil), urease
   activity (32.79 and 21.22 mu g urea hydrolized g(-1) dry soil h(-1) at
   37 degrees C by the buffer and non-buffer method, respectively) and acid
   phosphatase activity (1.99 mu mol p-nitrophenol released g(-1) dry soil
   h(-1) at 37 degrees C) than the others. The conversion of organic C into
   biomass C (2.46\%) was highest in Leuceana-treated soil.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is based on an extensive review of soil fertility in the
   literature of soil science, agronomy and ethnic studies. The spectrum of
   scientific opinions on soil fertility was visualized in mind-maps,
   definition types were analyzed, and problems within the conceptual
   approach towards soil fertility were shown. Differently oriented
   concepts were divided between the terms of soil fertility and soil
   quality. Soil fertility is not applicable as a technical term in natural
   sciences as it describes a definite, but dispositional (concealed), soil
   feature; therefore, it is not fully operationalizable for the natural
   sciences.
   Soil quality denotes undefined and interchangeable sets of appreciated
   soil attributes and functionalities, which are assigned by value
   judgements. It is a tool that integrates different soil state variables
   and functions in order to evaluate the capacity of a soil to do what it
   is expected (i.e. function) or to assess the sustainability of current
   land-use practices.
   The phenomenon of soil fertility appears to the consciousness as an
   autonomous counter-instance with its own mental and material qualities,
   referred to in traditional cultic cultivation. The main features of
   cultic cultivation of soil fertility are the uniting of the four
   elements, the religio towards the spiritual side of nature, the
   sacrificial, and the eros.
   A reevaluation of the soil fertility phenomenon in modern terms would be
   an innovative and forward-looking research program. Practical and
   scientific work on soil fertility should rediscover and revive the
   feeling for, and apperception of, the phenomenon of soil fertility in
   its mental and material aspects.}},

Abstract = {{Nematode communities offer several advantages for assessing the quality
   of soils. Diversity and maturity indices as well as trophic structure
   defining parameters based on the composition of soil nematode
   communities have been used to detect various kinds of man-induced
   disturbances and monitor ecological recovery. In the present paper we
   examined the response of these indices in herbaceous Mediterranean
   ecosystems. Incipient soils, which were developed on the top of waste
   dumping sites were compared with agricultural soils under fallow,
   Grasslands and old-fields were considered as reference systems. Either
   diversity or maturity indices were shown to be very sensitive to changes
   in soil system caused by waste dumping. However,they were less useful
   for the categorisation of perturbation in agroecosystems. Trophic
   composition related parameters were more meaningful for this aim. Plant
   parasite index (PPI) may be a good generic indicator of recovery
   processes after perturbation in these annual herbaceous ecosystems. (C)

Abstract = {{Most industrialised countries are currently drawing up their procedures
   to deal with contaminated land. In the Basque Country generic soil
   quality values applicable to different land uses have been drawn up for
   many common soil inorganic and organic pollutants, to assist in the site
   assessment process. In this paper we present those values aimed at
   protecting ecosystems as the main target at risk. Ecological risk was
   defined on the basis of effects on the structure of the soil
   invertebrate community. Ecotoxicological data from laboratory tests were
   used in combination with a theoretical extrapolation method. The
   following groups of compounds were assayed: heavy metals, cyanides,
   aromatic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, HCH isomers,
   chlorinated organic compounds, and mineral oil. A specific toxicity
   database was created. The reliability of the values obtained as well as
   the limitations of the derivation process are discussed. (C) 2000

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Drylands occupy 40\% of the earth's surface and are prone to land
   degradation by different processes. Desertification, a vague and
   qualitative term, implying degradation of soil and vegetation due to
   anthropogenic activity, reportedly affects 3.6 billion ha of the
   drylands. Although desertification is most severe in sub-Saharan Africa,
   the problem is nor confined to the developing countries and is also
   prevalent in arid and semi-arid regions of North America, Australia, and
   parts of Europe. Degradation of soil and vegetation leads to emission of
   greenhouse gases (e.g.. CO2, CH4, N2O) to the atmosphere. In contrast,
   improvement of soil quality through adoption of restorative measures can
   lead to increase in soil organic carbon content, improvement in biomass
   productivity, and mitigation of the greenhouse effect. Technological
   options for soil and vegetation restoration depend on ecozone
   characteristics and need to be validated and fine-tuned for
   site-specific situations. Restorative technologies include introducing
   appropriate plant species adopted to harsh environments, controlling
   erosion and reclaiming salt-affected soils, adopting water harvesting
   techniques and efficient irrigation systems. The potential of C
   sequestration of such measures may be 30 to 200 kg ha(-1) y(-1)
   depending on soil and ecozone characteristics Identification of
   ``trigger spots{''} may be necessary to set in motion the restorative
   process. While the potential of C sequestration in drylands may be high
   (0.9-1.9 Pg y(-1)), realization of even a fraction of this potential
   requires a coordinated effort at national and international levels.
   Development of a policy that involves participation of farmers and land
   managers is crucial in this endeavor.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of addition of municipal solid waste (MSW) at different
   degrees of stabilisation on the biological properties of an arid soil
   was studied 24 months after application. This included effects on the
   indigenous soil microflora and soil enzyme activities in the presence
   and absence of Pythium ultimum. The addition of organic waste (fresh or
   composted) reduced populations of culturable bacteria and fungi and
   disease symptoms caused by P. ultimum, and resulted in heavier plants
   with longer and more extensively branched roots. Addition of organic
   waste increased the population size of culturable bacteria and fungi,
   while enzymatic activity of the soil was higher in soil amended with
   organic matter than in non-amended soil. Populations of biological
   control agents, such as Trichoderma and fluorescent pseudomonads, were
   larger in soil amended with organic matter. The addition of urban waste
   could therefore be a suitable technique with which to restore soil
   quality by stimulating biological control against plant pathogens such
   as P. ultimum.}},

   strategies considering chemical analyses or bioassays, In the report
   Bioassays for soils, test methods which are at an advanced state of
   development and standardization are recommended by the German DECHEMA
   (German Society for Chemical Apparatus, Chemical Engineering and
   Biotechnology e.V.). Following this report six soil samples contaminated
   with different organic and inorganic substances are applied to bioassays
   using the following organisms: Scenedesmus subspicatus, Daphnia magna,
   Vibrio fischeri, Pseudomonas putida. Additionally, they are chemically
   analyzed. The test results demonstrate that toxic contaminants are
   present and bioavailable in water elutriates from two soils, indicating
   the necessity of bioassays and chemical analyses to predict potential
   risks from contaminated soils. Furthermore it is demonstrated that the
   described qualitative approach for the assessment of test results is not
   sufficient to quantify the risk potential of contaminated soils. (C)

Abstract = {{Quantitative techniques are needed to determine the effects of
   cultivation and livestock grazing on biological indicators of soils of
   the Northern Great Plains. Our objective was to determine how various
   management practices, which were representative of those used since
   European settlement in the 1880's, affected 3 biological indicators of
   soil quality. The study was conducted at 3 sites that are representative
   of the major grassland ecosystems in Canada: a Mixed Prairie site with
   Stipa comata Trin. \& Rupr. dominant in the Brown (Aridic Haploboroll)
   Soil Zone, a Mixed Prairie site with S. comata Trin. \& Rupr. and S.
   viridula Trin. dominant in the Dark Brown (Typic Haploboroll) Soil Zone,
   and a Fescue Prairie site with Festuca campestris Rydb, dominant in the
   Black (Udic Haploboroll) Soil Zone. At each site, 6 treatments
   representing common production practices were imposed and compared with
   the native community in a randomized complete block design with 4
   replicates and a plot size of 3 x 10 m. The treatments included: 1)
   monoculture seeding of 2 grass species; 2) alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.
   `Beaver'); 3) continuous spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. `Katepwa');
   4) spring wheat and fallow rotation; and 5) abandoned cultivated land.
   Our hypothesis that mineralizable-N, and phosphatase and dehydrogenase
   activities would be influenced by cultivation was confirmed by
   significant changes in these indicators that were detected after only
   180 days after treatment establishment. The pool of readily decomposable
   organic matter was reduced with cultivation and not replenished over the
   period of the study. The 3 biological indicators were sensitive to not
   only time following external management changes, but also to seasonal
   fluctuations. We conclude that soil biological indicators can be used to
   quantify temporal and botanical changes in diverse ecotypes within the
   Northern Great Plains.}},

Abstract = {{As demonstrated in Part II of this paper, the controls an
   erosion-induced loss in soil productivity are complex. Through the
   simulation model introduced in Part I, this part examines the
   biophysical performances of three conservation measures recommended for
   the Loess Plateau: bench terraces, grass strips and ridge tillage. Bench
   terraces are found to be the most effective in erosion control. However,
   the productivity gains in biomass yield saved show grass strips to be
   the best, followed by terrace and ridge tillage. Significant differences
   pertain according to initial soil condition and slope. Translating yield
   increases into monetary terms through the net present value, terraces
   have the lowest profitability because of their high construction costs.
   Grass strips have the best profitability. Internal rate of return gave a
   similar result, while the length of time before break-even is achieved
   showed that grass strips and ridge tillage become profitable within
   eight years. An alternative cropping system, now common on the Loess
   Plateau, of apple orchards on bench terraces was also tested. This gave
   an internal rate of return of 41 per cent with a payback within seven
   years, thus proving the attractiveness of this new cropping strategy.
   Both erosion control and effect on soil quality are key determinants in
   these analyses, and this research demonstrates how long-term scenarios
   in a modelling approach can provide good prediction of uptake and
   performance of conservation measures. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to determine the effect of slope terracing on soil
   quality in some oil palm plantations in Peninsular Malaysia. Samples
   from three different deep terraced-saprolitic profiles of varying depth
   and geology were collected and analysed for their physicochemical
   properties and chemical fertility characteristics. Field observations
   showed that saprolites lying below the soil layers were either exposed
   directly or exposed near to the surface as a result of slope terracing
   to enable oil palm planting. The fertility status of the exposed
   saprolites, despite being less weathered, were poorer than the soils.
   Comparatively, they have high phosphorus retention capacity, lower net
   negative charge and thus lower cation retention capacity. The Al
   phytotoxic effect, however, was lower in the saprolites than in the
   soils. The saprolites' physical properties were characterized by
   massiveness and lack of structural development, which enables high water
   retention but which may not be available to plants. The transformation
   of rock into saprolites showed significant depletion of base cations
   from the profiles, instituting poor fertility status of saprolites in
   comparison to the respective soil layers. The saprolite materials were
   also found to be unsuitable for oil palm cultivation, with shallowness,
   fertility and poor drainage conditions being the major constraints.

Abstract = {{Iron oxides and organic matter have a high capacity to adsorb ph and
   concomitantly maintain a low free Pb2+ activity in solution. It is,
   therefore, important to assess the adsorption capacity of naturally
   occurring materials and evaluate their potential to reduce toxicity. The
   free Pb2+ activity was measured in the solution in equilibrium with
   ferrihydrite (a synthetic Fe oxide), two field-collected pedogenic
   amorphous oxides, and leaf compost. The experiment used a factorial
   design varying total ph loading and solution pH. The results show that
   ferrihydrite was more efficient in lowering Pb aqueous concentration
   than the two pedogenic oxides. Furthermore, of the two pedogenic oxides
   examined, a higher Pb2+ activity was maintained in solution at
   equilibrium with the most crystalline phase, which also has a lower
   surface area relative to the other adsorbents. Leaf compost maintained a
   significantly higher free Pb2+ activity, relative to the various oxides.
   The experimental data could be fitted to a semi-mechanistic model
   predicting free Pb2+ activity as a function of total Ph loadings and pH,
   with R-2 varying from 0.77 to 0.92.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality assessment could become more standardized with the
   development of a simple, rapid, and reliable method for quantifying
   potential soil biological activity. We evaluated the flush of CO(2)
   following rewetting of dried soil under standard laboratory conditions
   as a method to estimate an active organic matter fraction. The bush of
   CO(2) following rewetting of dried soil (3 d incubation at approximate
   to 50\% water-filled pore space and 25 degrees C) was assessed for 20
   soil series containing a wide range of organic C (20 +/- 13 g kg(-1))
   from Alberta-British Columbia, Maine, Texas, and Georgia. This flush of
   CO(2) explained 97\% of the variability in cumulative C mineralization
   during 24 d {[}gamma = 12 + 3.3(x); n = 471], 86\% of the variability in
   soil microbial biomass C {[}gamma = 337 + 2.4(x); n = 399], and 67\% of
   the variability in net N mineralization during 24 d {[}gamma = 18 +
   0.10(x) - 0.00002(x)(2); n = 327], Accounting for geographical
   differences in mean annual temperature and precipitation, which could
   affect soil organic matter quality, further Improved relationships
   between the flush of CO(2) and active, passive, and total C and N pools.
   Measuring the flush of CO(2) following rewetting of dried soil may have
   value for routine soil testing of biological soil quality because it (i)
   is an incubation procedure patterned after natural occurrences in most
   soils, (ii) exhibits strong overall relationships with active organic
   pools, (iii) shows relatively minor changes in relationships with active
   organic pools that may be due to climatic variables, (iv) has a simple
   setup with minimal equipment requirements, and (v) has rapid analysis
   time.}},

Abstract = {{A regional survey of management and crop type and soil organic matter
   (SOM) content was conducted in one soil series in the Netherlands
   (loamy, mixed, mesic, Fluventic Eotrudept). The objective was to
   determine the effects of land use history on SOM contents in a prime
   agricultural soil, using available soil survey information and
   statistical analyses. Soil organic matter content is a relatively
   stable, integrating soil characteristic that reflects long-term land use
   and is an important indicator of soil quality. The SOM contents and
   information about past land use were obtained from 45 fields. Land use
   history was expressed in terms of (i) tillage; (ii) crop type; and (iii)
   use of chemical fertilizers, (iv) manure, and (v) biocides, for six
   successive periods (63-31, 31-15, 15-7, 7-3, 3-1, and 1-0 yr before
   sampling). Only four land use types occurred: conventional-arable,
   conventional-grass, organic-arable, and organic-grass. The SOM contents
   ranged between 17 and 88 g kg(-1). Regression models of the actual SOM
   content as a function of crop type and management in the different
   periods showed that SOM contents were increased under long-term grass
   or, to a lesser extent, by organic farming, when compared with
   conventional-arable use. The regression model depends on the nature of
   land use history in any particular region and on the length of the
   selected periods, but it provides an easy method to predict SORT content
   as a function of management in a given soil series. The method can be an
   alternative to simulation modeling in situations where detailed data
   records from long-term field experiments are not available.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter decline and associated degradation of soil and
   environmental conditions under conventional tillage in tropical and
   subtropical regions underline the need to develop sustainable soil
   management systems. This study aimed first to evaluate the long-term
   effect (9 years) of two soil-tillage systems (conventional tillage: CT,
   and no-tillage: NT) and two cropping systems (oat (Avena strigosa
   Schreb)/maize (Zea mays L.): O/M; and oat+common vetch (Vicia sativa
   L.)/ maize+cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp): O+V/M+C without N
   fertilization on total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN)
   concentrations in a sandy clay loam Acrisol in southern Brazil. The
   second objective was to assess soil potential for acting as an
   atmospheric CO2 sink. Under NT an increase of soil TOC and TN
   concentrations occurred, in both cropping systems, when compared with
   CT. However, this increase was restricted to soil surface layers and it
   was higher for O+V/M+C than for O/M, The O+V/M+C under NT, which
   probably results in the lowest soil organic matter losses (due to
   erosion and oxidation) and highest addition of crop residues, had 12 Mg
   ha(-1) more TOC and 0.9 Mg ha(-1) more TN in the 0-30.0 cm depth soil
   layer, compared with O/M under CT which exhibits highest soil organic
   matter losses and lowest crop residue additions to the soil. These
   increments represent TOC and TN accumulation rates of 1.33 and 0.10 Mg
   ha(-1) per year, respectively. Compared with CT and O/M, this TOC
   increase under NT and O+V/M+C means a net carbon dioxide removal of
   about 44 Mg ha(-1) from the atmosphere in 9 years. NT can therefore be
   considered, as it is in temperate climates, an important management
   strategy for increasing soil organic matter. In the tropicals and
   subtropicals, where climatic conditions cause intense biological
   activity, in order to maintain or increase soil organic matter, improve
   soil quality and contribute to mitigation of CO2 emissions, NT should be
   associated with cropping systems resulting in high annual crop residue
   additions to soil surface. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   gradient. Activities of beta-glucosidase, glutaminase, phosphatase and
   arylsulfatase, and OC content were greater in coarse-textured soils at a
   lower slope-position than in fine-textured soil at an upper
   slope-position. Tillage practice influenced activities of urease,
   glutaminase, beta-glucosidase and dehydrogenase but not OC content. The
   effect of tillage practice on enzyme activities was influenced by
   sampling depth and slope-position. Phosphatase and arylsulfatase
   activities of the Ap horizon behaved as indices of soil organic matter
   (SOM) content along the topographic gradient. Urease and dehydrogenase
   activities behaved as indices of soil biochemical activity within the Ap
   horizon. When interpreted in these terms, soil enzyme activities are
   comparable to other integrative measurements and as such describe system
   behavior and attributes.}},

Abstract = {{The long term impact of excreta return on some chemical and biological
   properties of a pasture soil fertilised with sulphur and phosphate was
   studied in a system that had been with or without excreta for 23 years.
   Excreta free areas that had developed under electric fencelines, and
   parallel transects in the paddocks, were sampled to provide this
   comparison. Sampling was to 300 mm depth in 0-75, 75-150 and 150-300 mm
   sections. Total carbon and nitrogen were 20\% higher in the 0-150 mm
   soil layer of areas receiving excreta but did not differ in the 150-300
   mm layer. Carbon:nitrogen ratios were similar in both systems as was
   mineralisable nitrogen, both absolutely and as a percentage of total in
   the 0-75 mm layer. Significantly more N was mineralised in the 75-150 mm
   layers of the areas receiving excreta but this was reversed in the
   150-300 mm layer. Nitrification rate was higher in all layers of the
   excreta areas. Inorganic and organic P fractions did not differ
   significantly. Total P was significantly higher in the 0-75 mm layer and
   significantly lower in the 150-300 mm layer of the excreta areas.
   Exchangeable potassium was much higher throughout the excreta areas
   while this was offset by calcium. The sum of the cations was similar in
   both areas. Excreta affected most of the diagnostic soil tests used for
   fertiliser recommendations. The soil properties measured did not reflect
   clearly the differences in productivity that were obvious in the two
   areas. It is concluded that excreta return has a impact resulting in
   increased organic matter storage. Short-term effects of urine have a
   greater impact on productivity. The major effect is on the disposition
   of cations and available P.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was performed in the vicinity of the industrial
   complex of Cubatao, Sao Paulo, Brazil, in order to evaluate the response
   of `manaca da serra' Tibouchina pulchra Cogn. (Melastomataceae), a
   common species of secondary Atlantic Rain Forest vegetation, to the
   impact of complex air pollution. Emphasis was given to changes of
   biochemical parameters such as ascorbic acid concentration, peroxidase
   activity, contents of water-soluble thiols, pH of leaf extract and
   buffering capacity. These plant factors are often used as early
   indicators of air pollution stress. Field experiments included sampling
   of leaves from mature trees in areas with different air pollution load
   (passive monitoring), exposure of saplings cultivated in uniform soil at
   these areas (active monitoring) and a study on the combined effects of
   contaminated soil and air pollution. In general, metabolic response of
   saplings was more accentuated than that of mature trees. Leaf extract pH
   and buffering capacity showed no or only small alterations in plants
   exposed to industrial emissions. In contrast, air pollution resulted in
   a distinct decrease in ascorbic acid contents and an increase in
   peroxidase activity and thiol concentrations in leaves. Cultivation of
   saplings in soil types from contaminated regions frequently caused the
   same modifications or enhanced the effects produced by air pollution.
   Growth analysis of exposed saplings demonstrated that a change of the
   relationship between above-ground and below-ground plant parts was the
   most obvious effect of air pollution and soil contamination. The
   experiments showed that even T. pulchra, a species considered resistant
   to air pollution, suffers metabolic disturbances by the present ambient
   air and soil quality. Although biochemical and physiological alterations
   were not related to a certain air pollution type, they could be used to
   estimate the overall pollution load and to map zones with different air
   quality. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The sustainability of current land use in agro-ecosystems can be
   assessed with respect to heavy-metal accumulation in soil by balancing
   their input and output fluxes. Even small heavy-metal accumulation rate
   in soils may lead to a violation of soil quality standards in the
   future. To undertake suitable preventive measures against heavy-metal
   enrichment in soil, estimated input and output fluxes need to be
   reliable. For this task we developed an empirical stochastic model that
   considers heavy-metal inputs by agricultural management as well as
   outputs, such as crop removal and leaching. In order to quantify the
   uncertainty in model output, we propagated the uncertainty in model
   parameter using a Latin Hypercube sampling strategy. In this paper we
   present the regional cadmium and zinc balances for the test region
   Sundgau, Switzerland, and the contribution of uncertain input parameters
   to the total variation of the net heavy-metal fluxes as determined by
   uncertainty analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Alfalfa is difficult to establish in much of western South Dakota where
   the environment is harsh and the soils tend to crust after tillage due
   to their high clay content. Our objectives were to determine whether
   alfalfa establishment could be improved on land treated with composted
   municipal solid waste (MSW) or MSW co-composted with organic biosolids
   (MSW-Bio) from a wastewater treatment facility, and to evaluate the
   effects of these materials on soil quality. Baseline soil data were
   collected from all plots in the fall before application of MSW.
   Composted material was incorporated into the soil at a targeted rate of
   0, 40, and 80 ton acre(-1) the fall or spring before planting. The
   number of alfalfa plants in a 1-ft(2) area was determined in three areas
   within each plot 47- and 75-d after planting and in the fall of the year
   after establishment. Alfalfa plant density was not affected by time of
   application. However, applying 80 ton acre(-1) resulted in significantly
   lower stand densities (P < .05) compared with the control. The MSW
   treatments had a neutral to slightly positive effect on the soil quality
   parameters measured.}},

Abstract = {{A field study was carried out in the high rainfall zone (HRZ, >600 mm
   p.a.) of southern Australia from March 1994 to August 1997 to test the
   hypothesis that sown perennial grasses and liming could make the
   existing pastures more sustainable through better use of water and
   nitrogen. The site, on an acid duplex soil at Book Book near Wagga Wagga
   in southern New South Wales, was typical of much of the HRZ grazing
   country in southern New South Wales and north-east Victoria. The
   experiment consisted of 4 replicate paddocks (each 0.135 ha) of 4
   treatments: annual pasture (mainly ryegrass Lolium rigidum, silver grass
   Vulpia spp., subterranean clover Trifolium subterraneum and broadleaf
   weeds) without lime, annual pasture with lime, perennial pasture
   (phalaris Phalaris aquatica, cocksfoot Dactylis glomerata and
   subterranean clover T. subterraneum) without lime, and perennial pasture
   with lime. Soil pH (0-10 cm) in the limed treatments was maintained at
   5.5 (0.01 mol/L CaCl2), compared to 4.1 in the unlimed treatments. The
   pastures were rotationally grazed with Merino ewe or wether hoggets at a
   stocking rate which varied with the season, but was 10-25\% higher on
   the limed pastures {[}14.8-17.3 dry sheep equivalent (dse)/ha] than the
   unlimed pastures. One replicate set of pasture treatments was
   intensively monitored for surface runoff, subsurface flow (at the top of
   the B horizon), water potential gradients and ammonium volatilisation.
   Other measurements of nitrogen inputs, transformations and losses were
   made on all paddocks.
   In a normal to wet year, surface runoff, subsurface flow and deep
   drainage (>180 cm depth) were about 40 mm less from the perennial than
   the annual pastures. The reduction in deep drainage under the perennials
   was about one-third to one-half (20-29 mm/year). The smaller loss of
   solution NO3- from the perennial pastures (up to 12 kg N/ha.year)
   suggested soil acidification under perennials was reduced by about 1
   kmol H+/ha.year. Denitrification and volatilisation losses of N were
   small (1-12 kg N/ha.year). Nitrogen fixed by subterranean clover (above
   ground parts) ranged from 2-8 kg N/ha in the drought of 1994-95 to 128
   kg N/ha in a normal year (1996). The soil-pasture nitrogen balance was
   positive for all treatments and averaged 76 kg N/ha.year over 2 years.
   The abundance of introduced and native earthworms increased from 85 to
   250/m(2) in the limed pastures between 1994 and 1997. Introduced
   species, such as Aporrectodea trapezoides, were especially responsive to
   lime. Animal production per hectare was 10-25\% higher on pastures with
   lime. Critical gross margins per dse were lowest (\$16/ha) for a
   long-lived perennial pasture (>15 years), and highest (\$20/ha) for a
   short-lived perennial (5 years). Overall, there were substantial
   benefits in animal production, improved soil quality and water use from
   establishing perennial grass pastures with lime on these strongly acid
   soils.}},

Title = {{Irrigation of an allophanic soil with dairy factory effluent for 22

Abstract = {{Long-term application of wastewater adds large amounts of carbon (C),
   nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) to soils, and their effects on soil
   quality are not fully known. We compared the distribution of C, N, P,
   and Olsen P in the top 0.75 m of an allophanic soil after 22 years
   irrigation with dairy factory effluent with that in a non-irrigated
   soil. Earthworm species, biomass and distribution, microbial biomass,
   microbial activity, and relative use of substrates were measured to
   evaluate the contribution of biological processes to cycling and
   redistribution of total C. Total C did not differ between irrigated and
   nonirrigated soil, although there was less total C in the 0-0.1 m layer
   and more total C at 0.1-0.5 m in the effluent-irrigated soil. Microbial
   biomass C and basal respiration activity were increased by 4- and
   1.6-fold, respectively, in the 0-0.1 m layer of the irrigated soil.
   Measurements of relative use of substrates indicated that the greater
   microbial biomass in the effluent-irrigated soil was supported by the
   inputs of available C (particularly lactose) in the effluent rather than
   by greater decomposition of the organic C in the soil. Irrigation
   increased total N storage by 2.1 t/ha and total P was increased by 11.5
   t/ha. Most of the increase in total N occurred in the 0.1-0.5 m layers,
   whereas total P was greater at all depths. Olsen P also increased at all
   depths by 1.3- to 23-fold. Approximately 8\% of the N and 91\% of the P
   applied during the past 22 years was stored in the 0-0.75 m layer of the
   profile, with the potential for further P storage. Effluent irrigation
   increased the total soil nutrient stores, without detrimental effects on
   total C storage. Changes in nutrient distribution at the irrigated site
   can be partially attributed to leaching and the dominance (155 g/m(2))
   of the earthworm Aporrectodea longa, which forms permanent burrows to
   lower depths.}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{85-100}},
Abstract = {{Changes in soil properties in response to cropping pressure were
   measured in 2 mineralogically contrasting New Zealand topsoils. Waiareka
   clay (Vertic Haplustoll) with >65\% smectite clay was compared with
   Wakanui silt loam (Aquic Haplustept), which contains about 20\% mixed or
   illite clays. Soil properties (0-10 cm) were assessed by changes in
   organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), pH, cation exchange capacity, Olsen
   P, microbial C, soil respiration, microbial functional evenness,
   mineralisable N, bulk density, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity,
   readily available and total available water, macro porosity and total
   porosity, particle density, and particle size distribution. Additional
   samples of the Waiareka clay soil were taken at 10-20 cm depth. Cropping
   pressure was estimated using a scale based on the number of years in
   crop v. those in pasture.
   The organic and biological status of the Waiareka pasture soil (0-10 cm)
   was greater than that of the Wakanui pasture, with contents of 5.1\%
   organic C, 0.43\% total N, 1429 microbial C (mu g/cm(3)), and 123
   mineralisable N (mu g/cm(3)), compared with values of 4.0\%, 0.31\%, 795
   mu g/cm(3), and 89 mu g/cm(3), respectively. Total and macroporosity,
   and total and readily available water, were also greater on the Waiareka
   pasture soil compared with the Wakanui pasture soil. Under cropping
   pressure, the Waiareka soil had marked declines in organic matter C and
   N, microbial C and soil respiration, microbial functional evenness,
   macroporosity, and available water. In contrast, the Wakanui silt loam
   showed little response to cropping pressure; mineralisable N declined
   slightly and particle density increased under cropping.
   We concluded that the initial properties of a soil were not good
   predictors of subsequent resistance to cropping pressure; and that soils
   with initially high status have the potential for proportionally greater
   decline.}},

Abstract = {{Ergosterol is generally assumed to be one of the best indicators of
   fungal biomass and soil quality. The present case studies describe
   variations in ergosterol content in soil, sampled at three Danish Farms.
   One is organically cultivated according to the biodynamical principles
   (ORG). The other two are conventionally cultivated, one with animal
   husbandry (CONV-H) and one with plant production (CONV-P). The
   analytical method combined extraction in a microwave oven, clean-up with
   a new SPE sort,ent material (Oasis(TM)), and quantification by HPLC. The
   average estimated concentrations of ergosterol were 1.66 mug g(-1) in
   ORG, 2.35 mug g(-1) in CONV-H and 1.13 mug g(-1) in CONV-P. These
   results correlated well with some of the important variables in the
   management systems of the soils (frequency of grass and clover, input of
   animal manure, total-C, frequency of ploughing). However, the exact
   causal relationships cannot be revealed using the case-study approach.
   The statistical analysis of the spatial variation in ergosterol across
   the field demonstrated very clearly that in some soils, small-scale few
   cm(2)) variations in ergosterol concentrations may be quite large in
   comparison with large scale (few hundred m(2)) variations. This should
   be taken into account when planning the sampling strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The rhizosphere is the zone of influence of plant roots on the
   associated microbiota and soil constituents. The supply of
   photosynthates, as substrates to soil microbiota, is a key fact in
   rhizosphere formation. Developing root-soil interfaces create dynamic
   microenvironments where microorganisms, plant roots and soil components
   interact. Because some rhizosphere microorganisms, which include
   saprophytes and mutualistic symbionts, play fundamental roles to benefit
   plant growth and health and soil physicochemical properties microbial
   colonisation of root environments has a substantial impact on plant
   fitness and soil quality.
   Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen (N(2))-fixing bacteria, mutualistic
   symbionts, are particularly important. Arbuscular mycorrhiza are is the
   mycorrhizal type formed by crop species of agronomic interest. The
   responsible mycorrhizal fungi, after the biotrophic colonization of root
   cortex, develop an external mycelium which is a bridge connecting the
   root with the surrounding soil microhabitats. Such mycorrhizal
   (fungal-root) symbiosis is critical for nutrient cycling in soil-plant
   systems. Mycorrhiza also improve plant health through increased
   protection against biotic and abiotic stresses. In cooperation with
   other soil organisms, the external mycorrhizal mycelium forms
   water-stable aggregates necessary for good soil tilth. Mycorrhiza
   establishment is known to change mineral nutrient composition, hormonal
   balance, C allocation patterns, and other aspects of plant physiology.
   Changes in the chemical composition of root exudates in mycorrhizal
   plants, in addition to physical modifications induced by the mycorrhizal
   soil mycelium on the environment surrounding the roots, affect both
   quantitatively and qualitatively the microbial populations in the
   rhizosphere and develop the so-called mycorrhizosphere. Biotechnological
   and molecular management of rhizosphere/mycorrhizosphere interactions
   are key factors for a sustainable plant productivity.}},

Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{93-104}},
Abstract = {{It is necessary to develop new, dean and renewable biofuels to mitigate
   the greenhouse effect and reduce dependence on nonrenewable fossil
   fuels. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has been chosen by the US
   Department of Energy as its model herbaceous energy crop in the
   Southeast due to high yields, low production costs, economic benefits,
   and little competition from existing enterprises. However, knowledge of
   its influence on soil carbon (C) dynamics is limited, as no systematic
   study of soil C dynamics in switchgrass culture has been conducted. Our
   objective was to determine C dynamics subsequent to switchgrass
   establishment and the impact of cultural practices (row spacing and
   harvest frequency) on C biogeochemical characteristics in a sandy loam
   soil (Typic Paleudult) and a clay loam soil (Typic Hapludult). Results
   indicated that soil C characteristics changed over time after
   switchgrass establishment. Carbon mineralization, microbial biomass C, C
   turnover, and \% microbial biomass C in organic C was generally higher
   approximately 2 years after switchgrass planting than after its initial
   establishment in a sandy loam soil. Specifically, C mineralization
   increased by 112 and 254\% at depths of 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm,
   respectively; microbial biomass C increased by 168\% in the top 15 cm of
   soil; and C turnover increased by 116 and 255\% at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm,
   respectively. Microbial biomass comprised 0.76 +/- 0.09\% and 0.75 +/-
   0.19\% of soil organic C in 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depths, respectively,
   of sandy loam soil, while it made up 1.37 +/- 0.22\% and 1.11 +/- 0.19\%
   of soil organic C in the same soil depths in day loam soil. Harvesting
   once resulted in more C turnover than harvesting twice in the sandy loam
   soil. Linear regression between soil C characteristics and switchgrass
   root weight, root C, and root nitrogen (N) returned to soil support the
   conclusion that soil C accumulation is positively related to root input.
   It appears that switchgrass establishment may have dual benefits as a
   source of renewable energy and as a means of improving soil quality.
   However, longer periods of study will be required to elucidate
   substantial gains in soil quality owing to switchgrass culture. (C) 2000

Title = {{Effects of 30 years of cropping and tillage systems on surface soil test
   changes}},
Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{241-257}},
Abstract = {{A common belief is that no-till systems with adequate fertility will
   improve soil quality over other tillage systems. The objectives of this
   study were to determine if crop phase, tillage systems, and n rate in a
   long-term rotation affected soil chemical analyses in the surface 15 cm
   of soil and to evaluate the trend in chemical analyses. To test this
   hypothesis, surface soil samples were taken from a long-term (30-year)
   cropping and tillage study. This study was initiated in 1965 on a Harney
   silt loam soil in Central Kansas with every phase of the
   wheat-sorghum-fallow (WDF) rotation included each year. Tillage systems
   included clear-till (CT), reduced-till (RT), and no-till (NT). In 1975,
   four nitrogen (N) rates (0, 22, 45, 67 kg N ha(-1)) were incorporated by
   subdividing the tillage plots. Topdressed N, as ammonium nitrate, was
   the only fertilizer added throughout the duration of the study. Soil
   samples were taken at depths of 0 to 7.5 and 7.5 to 15 cm in all plots
   in 1965 and in 1995. In 1998, soils on 1997 sorghum plots were samples
   in 2.5-cm increments to 15 cm. Samples from all dates were analyzed for
   pH, available phosphorus (AP), and organic matter (OM), and deviations
   from the controls from 1965 to 1995 were assessed by subtracting 1995
   results from 1965 results. The change in soil pH showed a crop phase by
   sample depth interaction. In the wheat phase, pH in the top 7.5 cm
   increased by 0.19 and increased by 0.28 in the 7.5-15 cm layer. In the
   fallow phase, pH increased by 0.04 and 0.35 in the top 7.5 cm and 7.5-15
   cm layers, respectively. The pH change for sorghum was intermediate for
   both depths. The increase in overall pH from 1965 to 1995 was unexpected
   and contrary to normal expectations of a decrease over time. Soil OM was
   not changed significantly over the 30 years of the study, suggesting
   that OM buildup or depletion is very slow under this cropping system on
   a nearly level soil with minimal soil erosion. Increasing the rate of N
   application significantly reduced pH in the upper increment samples, but
   had little effect on pH below 10 cm. The NT system had the lowest
   surface increment in pH, but differences among tillage systems were
   minimal below 7.6 cm. The AP was highest for NT in the surface
   increment, but for CT at deeper depths. Likewise, OM was highest for NT
   in the 2.5 cm increment and the CT at deeper increments. Under the
   present N management, pH may reach levels where herbicide effectiveness
   and phosphorus availability could be affected adversely. Deep tillage by
   one-way or mold-board plowing might be an interim solution to raise the
   pH before liming is implemented or P fertilizer is added to maintain
   adequate AP throughout the top 15 cm. Nitrogen management may need to be
   changed to some form of band-type placement to reduce the total N
   applied. Under the conditions of this study (WSF, reduced tillage, and
   57 cm annual precipitation), soil OM increased very slowly.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter and its chemical fractions have a profound impact on
   soil chemical and physical properties. In turn, the effect of management
   (cropping and tillage) on the quantity and chemical properties of soil
   organic matter can be substantial. The objective of this study was to
   compare the effects of specific tillage regimes and crop sequences
   commonly used in the central Great Plains of the United States on the
   quantity, quality, and distribution with depth of soil organic carbon
   (SOC). Soils were sampled in 1 cm or 2 cm increments to a depth of 10 cm
   from experimental field plots on a Sharpsburg silty clay loam (fine,
   montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Argiudoll). The plots had been under 6
   continuous tillage regimes since 1978 and cropped to continuous corn,
   continuous soybean, or corn-soybean in rotation since 1985. Soils were
   analyzed for total SOC, fulvic acid (FA) carbon, and humic acid (HA)
   carbon. No-till and continuous corn (Zea mays L.) management generally
   had the highest SOC, with a sharp reduction in SOC below 2 cm. Only
   no-till increased FA, which also decreased with depth, especially
   between 2 and 4 cm. Humic acid concentration was highest under
   continuous corn but was unaffected by tillage. Humic acid also was
   highest in the 1- to 2-cm increment of continuous corn. Two ratios which
   are used as indices of degree of humification, HA/FA and (HA+FA)/SOC,
   gave different estimates of the effect of management. Only continuous
   corn increased HA/FA, suggesting increased humification. No treatment
   affected (HA+FA)/SOC. Overall, continuous corn and no-till contributed
   the greatest amounts of residue and maintained a soil environment
   conducive to preserving the resulting organic matter. These management
   options increase not only total SOC, but also alter the quality of that
   SOC as measured by KA and FA. These changes in SOC characteristics may
   have implications for long-term soil quality and soil productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Prince Edward Island (PEI) has a land area of 575,000 hectares and its
   landscape is undulating. About half the land is cleared, the other half
   under natural forest. The long term effect of intensive farming
   practices on soil health is becoming a matter of concern as it is felt
   that soil quality may deteriorate through continuous agrichemical inputs
   and loss of productive topsoil through erosion. This study was
   established to: set up a process to measure soil quality, establish soil
   quality indicators, measure soil quality on an on-going basis and report
   results to the public. The sampling locations were selected on a 4 km x
   4 km grid across PEI. A total of 232 agricultural sampling locations
   were selected and located by GPS (Global Positioning System). A cluster
   of up to five samples was taken at each location, depending on land use.
   One sample will be taken at the selected GPS coordinates and the other
   four, 100 metres due south, north, west and east respectively. In the
   232 sampling locations selected, the actual number of samples taken will
   be 796. One third of the sampling locations are being sampled each year,
   starting in 1998. Three groups of parameters are being measured:
   Physical Parameters (depth of A and B horizons soil type, length and
   degree of slope, position of sample on slope, crops grown, crop rotation
   and type of tillage), Chemical Parameters (Organic Matter, Total Carbon,
   pH, Phosphorus, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Boron, Zinc, Sulfur,
   Manganese, Iron, Sodium, CEC, and Base Saturation), Microbial Parameters
   (microscopic observation, enzyme assays). The analyses of the collected
   data focuses on determining the existence of statistically significant
   relationships among the measured variables. The methods to be applied
   include logistic and linear regression, examination of correlations, as
   well as methods specifically designed for spatial or geographic data.
   GIS (Geographical Information System) maps of PEI are being be developed
   to show patterns of the various parameters measured. As data collection
   proceeds over time, time series methods or longitudinal methods of
   regression will also be employed to determine if the relationships or
   associations observed in the initial data hold up over time. This
   project will provide information to policy makers, researchers and the
   general pubic about Prince Edward Island current soil quality and the
   trends in soil quality over time.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality is an increasingly useful and necessary concept in the
   design of sustainable farming systems, at paddock, farm and catchment
   levels. This paper reviews the concept of soil quality, and discusses
   its importance to the sustainability of agroecosystems. It is generally
   accepted that ``soil quality{''} be measured by an appropriate suite of
   characteristics that includes chemical, physical and biological
   indicators that focus on the functions of soil in the ecosystem.
   Although there may be some merit in defining soil quality with the same
   rigour as is used to define water quality, and applying soil quality
   criteria in the same way as water quality criteria, it is likely that
   site and purpose specific criteria will be more useful at the farm
   level. Research continues to determine the optimum set of soil quality
   indicators that are sensitive to soil quality dynamics relevant to
   grazing systems in the Central Tablelands of N.S.W., and can be adopted
   and interpreted by farmers. One such project has commenced at Orange
   Agricultural College - The University of Sydney, and is described in
   detail. It is expected that this research will help provide farm
   managers with additional tools to assess the condition and trend of soil
   quality on their farms, and the impact of their decisions regarding farm
   design and management.}},

Abstract = {{A project aiming at the development of a practical bio-indication system
   for evaluating forest soil duality was recently started up. The project
   is funded by the Flemish Forestry Administration responsible for the
   protected Flemish forests and is managed by the Institute for Forestry
   and Game Management (IBW). In the project the arthropod fauna of fifty
   forest stands distributed all over the Flemish Region was sampled by
   traps operative from spring 1997 till spring 1998. All these plots were
   also investigated in relation to the physical and chemical properties of
   their soil and litter layers. The variation of the composition of the
   spider communities of these stands is unclear when we compare it with
   the most important litter and soil parameters, but future investigations
   with more (structural) parameters will hopefully give a good
   explanation. On a subregional scale, in forests on the same soil type
   (loam), spider community composition seems to be determined by humidity
   and density of tree coverage. Spider species for which abundance
   correlates with these major environmental factors are candidate
   bio-indicators to monitor forest soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{The creation of favourable conditions beneficial for biomass production
   is only one of several functions that soil fulfils. Polyfunctional
   approach to the soil assessment is unified in a term soil quality or
   soil health. In our opinion soil quality is expressing soil capability
   to secure soil ecological functions at its concrete utilization manner.
   Decisive soil functions, from the view of formation environmental
   stability and subsequently life quality are following soil functions:
   biomass production, filtering and accumulation function, transforming
   function, sanitation function, buffering function, biological habitat
   and gene reserve. When evaluating soil duality, two main goals are
   distinguished: mutual comparison of soil quality at different soil
   representatives for potential soil price derivation, and soil quality
   changes monitoring or its parameters, namely in direction of soil
   degradation.
   Individual ecological function on the level of soil types is
   orientationally evaluated in range 0 to 100 points. Soil quality is
   subsequently expressed as an average of the values obtained for the soil
   functions, whereby each of the functions has equal position. Soil value
   and subsequently price practical application, based on ecological soil
   function evaluation, is primarily visible in the case of permanent
   seizure of soil first of all for infrastructure development, building of
   refuse dumps and mining of raw-materials.}},

Abstract = {{Risk assessment at the regional level requires quality resource
   information on critical factors for sustainable land-use decisions. This
   paper describes a major community initiative underway in the Southland
   Region of New Zealand involving geographic information systems mapping
   of 850,000 ha at a 1:50,000 scale. At a southerly latitude of 46 degrees
   in the southern part of the South Island of New Zealand, the critical
   factors affecting plant growth are soil quality and air temperature. Air
   temperature is being measured with a network of 900 automatic data
   loggers positioned to represent key features of the landscape and
   recording maximum and minimum temperatures every hour for a full year.
   Data are then differentially adjusted using the nearest long-term
   weather station to the site to generate a 30-year normal temperature
   record and consequent growing-degree-day value for each site. Isocontour
   maps are then generated to identify microclimates of interest within the
   landscape. Soils of the area are being mapped at the same time and to
   the same scale to allow integrated development of the critical
   information for sustainable land-use decisions. Basic soil attributes
   will be interpreted to produce maps for crop suitability, vulnerability
   to structural degradation, and leaching risk. High-class soils will also
   be identified. An Internet site and a bureau service will be
   established. This will provide technical support and interpretation of
   the data for clients to encourage wide use of the information produced
   by the project. The project is being supported and funded by the local
   community in the belief that the provision of high-quality resource
   information will lead to significant employment opportunities in the
   region.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term sustainability of pasture management systems, whether
   related to structural stability or nutrient dynamics, is dependent upon
   maintaining soil biological properties. This study investigates the
   extent to which the microbiological and biochemical properties of soil
   can change with season and pasture management system, including their
   likely value as indicators of soil quality. The experiment was conducted
   on a 30-ha pasture near Brandon, Manitoba, Seasonal fluctuations were
   observed in the soil microbial and biochemical properties. In general,
   these fluctuations were mainly independent of the small variations in
   soil organic matter content but were more closely related to soil water
   content. The data also suggests an impact of stocking rate and grazing
   system on soil microbial biomass C and on N mineralization potential.
   However, because duration of the investigation, limited number of
   replications and the high soil variability encountered, it is not yet
   possible to recommend any particular grazing system and/or stocking rate
   favorable for the maintenance of soil biological quality. The trends
   suggest that light, continuous grazing systems had the largest microbial
   biomass and nutrient mineralizing activity.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality or rendition is best assessed by soil properties that are
   neither so permanent as to be insensitive to management, nor so easily
   changeable as to give little indication of long-term alterations.
   Thirteen such intermediate properties were evaluated for potential
   inclusion in a soil quality index by comparing soils under contrasting
   management systems from long-term replicated field experiments and from
   paired field sites. Conservation (v. conventional) management was
   defined as some combination of reduced tillage, increased crop
   diversity, more perennial crops, increased crop residue return,
   increased soil fertility and/or increased application of organic
   amendments. Conservation management most consistently and markedly
   influenced soil quality indicator properties by increasing total and
   active microbial biomass carbon (C-TMB and C-AMB) increasing the ratio
   of active microbial biomass carbon to total organic carbon (C-AMB/C-ORG)
   increasing aggregation and decreasing the rate of basal respiration per
   unit of microbial biomass carbon (qCO(2)). The qCO(2) increased
   exponentially as C-TMB decreased. This may indicate reduced stress on
   soil microbial communities under conservation management and high
   microbial populations.}},

Abstract = {{Surface {[}5 to 10 cm, (2 to 4 in) depth] soil quality was examined from
   fields representing short and long term enrollment in the Conservation
   Reserve Program (CRP). Total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) amounts were
   similar in soil with recent and long term enrollment in the CRP and were
   lower than a native prairie field. Active pools of C and N, however did
   increase through the CRP. Soil with long term establishment of native
   grasses in the CRP exhibited 141\% and 93\% greater microbial biomass C
   and N, respectively, than soil recently enrolled in the CRP. Total
   inorganic N was significantly lower in CRP soil with ten versus no
   growing seasons and was more representative of levels in a native
   prairie due to reductions in nitrate availability. Our study indicates
   that CRP promotes soil restoration; however ten growing seasons are not
   adequate for recovery of total soil C and N pools at this depth to
   pre-cultivation levels.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of human population in the developing countries
   necessitates developing strategies for sustainable food production
   through efficient use of natural resources. Use of subsistence
   agricultural practices has resulted in excessive removal of nutrients
   from the ecosystem, causing a negative balance of plant nutrients in
   soil. Chemical Fertilizers used in combination with organic manures can
   effectively meet the nutrient needs of crops. Efficient use of chemical
   fertilizers requires an optimum level of organic matter in the soil,
   achievable by integrated use of nutrients through chemical fertilizers,
   organic materials or biosolids including composts and crop residues,
   inclusion of legumes in crop rotations, green manuring and use of
   bionutrients. Maintenance and improvement of soil quality through
   cropping systems is important to sustaining agricultural productivity.
   Soil quality enhancement requires improvement of soil physical, chemical
   and biological properties through improvement of soil structure, macro-
   and micronutrient status, soil organic matter content, and soil
   biodiversity. Several studies have documented the benefits of judicious
   use of chemical fertilizers and organic manures in maintaining soil
   quality and enhancing crop productivity. In addition, the importance of
   improved cropping systems, crop rotations and tillage practices in
   maintaining soil quality cannot be over-emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancing soil quality in intensive agricultural systems is important to
   sustaining productivity and improving environmental quality. Crapping
   systems play an important role in determining soil physical
   characteristics and in nutrient cycling mechanisms. Field experiments
   were conducted at the Agronomy Farm of The Ohio State University,
   Columbus, Ohio on a well-drained Miamian silty-clay loam soil to assess
   cropping systems effects on soil physical properties. There were a total
   of 11 cropping system treatments involving 6 cover crops, 4 crop
   rotations and a fallow plot. All cropping system treatments were managed
   at two fertilizer levels. Dry soil aggregate stability, mean weight
   diameter, and moisture retention were determined for the 0-10 cm layer.
   Aggregate stability was high (93-96\%), and not significantly affected
   by cropping systems and fertilizer levels. The mean weight diameter of
   aggregates varied from 5.9 to 6.1 mm. The cropping systems had no
   significant effect on mean weight diameter but the fertilizer level had
   a significant effect on it. The effect of cropping system treatments on
   soil moisture retention characteristics was significant only at near
   field capacity (-0.1 MPa suction).}},

Abstract = {{Flood risk in the lower Meuse has increased as a result of changes in
   land and water management practices along with canalisation of the upper
   Meuse and its tributaries in Belgium and France. The dramatic floods of
   1993 and 1995 prompted Dutch government to develop the Delta Plan for
   Large Rivers. Under this plan, the Dutch State Water Authority and the
   Province of Limburg launched the Maaswerken project in April 1997. The
   aims of the Maaswerken were to reduce flooding, to improve navigation
   and to create new riparian wetlands in the lower Meuse floodplain.
   Another important major goal of the Maaswerken project is the extraction
   of gravel and sand. The costs of the Maaswerken project, however,
   increased dramatically in areas where the floodplain sediments along the
   Meuse were highly polluted with heavy metals (e.g., zinc, cadmium and
   lead) and organic contaminants (e.g., PAHs and PCBs). The contaminated
   sediments represent a form of diffuse pollution and are redistributed
   during floods. A new policy of dynamic soil management was developed
   within the Maaswerken project in order to control costs while
   maintaining the original river management goals and reducing the risk to
   human health and the environment. Ln order to develop and apply dynamic
   soil management successfully, an accurate soil quality distribution map
   of the polluted sediments was generated.}},

Abstract = {{In 1988 an experiment was established at the Rodale Institute
   Experimental Farm to study weed control and nitrogen (N) management in
   rotations with grain crops and N-fixing green manures under reduced
   tillage without the use of herbicides. Tillage intensities ranging from
   moldboard plow (MP) to continuous no-till (NT) were compared. We present
   results for maize production in 1994, the seventh year of the
   experiment. Our goal was to further investigate reduced tillage regimes
   that alternated no-till with different forms of primary tillage in
   legume-based systems. In the chisel-disc (CD) and MP treatments
   comparable yields were achieved under so-called organic (weeds
   controlled with cultivation and green manure N source) and conventional
   management (weeds controlled with herbicides and mineral N fertilizer
   applied). Weed competition in these treatments was minimal and the N
   status of maize plants was essentially the same regardless of the N
   source (fertilizer or green manure). Of the four organic no-till maize
   treatments, only the mixed-tillage system with cultivation for weed
   control (CD-NTc) produced yields comparable to conventional NT maize.
   The fate of vetch N as well as temporal N dynamics were largely
   determined by tillage intensity and the handling of the vetch residues
   at maize planting. Treatments with primary tillage (CD and MP) had
   extremely high levels of mineral N early in the season and had greater
   average net N-mineralization, even though N content of hairy vetch in
   these treatments was equal to or lower than that in treatments with
   mow-killed vetch. In terms of soil mineral N concentrations, the CD-NTc
   treatment was similar to the other mow-killed vetch/no-till maize
   treatments. However, N availability in this treatment was greater,
   probably due to more complete decomposition of green manure residues.
   Cultivation for weeds not only helped control weeds but also increased
   mineralization of the vetch residues, which in turn increased the N
   supply during the period of maximum N demand by the maize. Carefully
   designed rotations combining tillage reductions with the use of
   leguminous N sources can have multiple benefits, including improved
   timing of N availability, reduced herbicide applications, and improved
   soil quality in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of trees in grasslands frequently results in resource
   islands of higher soil quality. Therefore, some native trees are often
   preserved or agroforestry species are interplanted when land is cleared
   for pasture. We evaluated soil quality changes associated with the
   conversion of a native thorn forest (caatinga) into silvo-pastoral
   systems in semiarid NE Brazil. Soil nutrients, organic matter, microbial
   biomass and soil enzymes under native caatinga, the canopy of two
   preserved native (Ziziphus joazeiro and Spondias tuberosa) and one
   introduced tree species (Prosopis juliflora), and under a planted
   pasture of Cenchrus ciliaris were compared. The two preserved tree
   species maintained high nutrient and organic matter contents and high
   biological activity levels not only relative to the grass but also
   relative to the native caatinga. The non-deciduous Z. joazeiro was more
   effective than the deciduous S. tuberosa, and enriched surface soils by
   100 mg P kg(-1). The complete replacement of natural caatinga with C.
   ciliaris pasture or a C. ciliaris-P. juliflora silvopastoral system had,
   after 14 years, decreased microbial biomass C and N contents, and
   ss-glucosidase activity, but did not affect soil nutrient or organic
   matter status. The biological activity under the trees of the tree-grass
   association was greater than under grass alone, although P. juliflora
   did not maintain higher nutrient or organic matter levels. The search
   for indigenous alternatives to the main agroforestry species may provide
   viable alternatives for improved land management and the conservation of
   biodiversity. Microbiological and biochemical parameters responded more
   readily to changes in land management than chemical fertility indices.
   They are important indices for the impact of vegetation changes and its
   associated land quality changes.}},

Abstract = {{Intensively managed woody and herbaceous biomass crops can provide
   feedstocks for energy and fiber as well as multiple environmental
   benefits. Site-specific studies are quantifying both the environmental
   potential and ramifications of converting agricultural croplands to
   biomass crop production. Research-scale comparisons of biomass crops,
   conservation tiliage, and traditional agricultural crop production show
   that aggregate stability and carbon storage increased concomitantly with
   decreased bulk density and penetration resistance under biomass and
   no-till agricultural crop production with land-use conversion from
   traditionally cultivated agricultural crops. Use of cover crops on woody
   crop plantings increased soil stability and carbon storage. The results
   of this study are being used by the Bioenergy Feedstock Development
   Program to help identify management strategies to increase biomass crop

Abstract = {{Whereas composting agricultural wastes could solve problems related to
   water and soil quality, it can present a risk of pollution to the
   atmosphere. The various gases emitted have to be quantified, and the
   mechanisms leading to their production, identified.
   For this purpose, about 25 m(3) of a poplar bark-poultry dung mixture
   was composted in a covered place with natural ventilation, air coming in
   the lower part and going out through four shafts in the upper part. The
   gaseous emissions were measured and analysed. At the same time, a
   control pile was sampled in order to determine microbial population and
   activity. The first heaps (initial C/N of 21) were monitored for one
   month, then turned and more dung added. The second heaps (initial C/N of
   8) were monitored for seven months with two intermediate turnings.
   Carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, and nitric and nitrous oxides contents
   were measured. Methane, present in depth at high concentration, was
   emitted at low concentration. The nitrogen loss (about 50\% for the
   second heap) was half as ammonia. Nitrous oxide constituted less than
   1\% of the nitrogenous gases, was produced principally at the end of
   composting, and related to the presence of nitrification-denitrification
   and bacteria potentially active in those activities.}},

Abstract = {{We used a quantitative index to assess the effects of conventional,
   integrated, and organic apple production systems on soil quality in the
   Yakima Valley of Washington state, USA (latitude 46 degrees 30' N). Four
   replicate plots for each apple management system were planted in a
   randomized, complete block design on a 1.7 hectare commercial `Golden
   Delicious' apple (Malus domestica Burkh.) orchard at a density of 2430
   trees per hectare. The site had been in grass pasture prior to planting
   the apple trees in May, 1994. The study area is made up of Cleman and
   Shano very fine sandy loams which are coarse-loamy mesic Xerifluventic
   Haplocambids. The soil quality index we used is a weighted additive
   model of the soil's capacity to accommodate water entry, facilitate
   water transfer and absorption, resist degradation, and sustain crop
   productivity and quality. We determined critical threshold values and
   relative importance for each soil property based on published data and
   soil conditions in adjacent permanent grass sites. Soil quality was
   higher under both the integrated and organic apple production systems,
   as these systems resulted in increased surface water infiltration,
   higher microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, greater surface aggregate
   stability, and more earthworms than the conventional system. Our goal
   for developing such site-specific soil quality indices is to assist
   researchers, consultants, and producers in evaluating long-term effects
   of specific farm management systems on soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Earliglow (cv.) strawberry Fragaria ananassa; plants were planted in a
   matted row system and harvested for three years (yrs). Composted yard
   waste (CYW) was obtained in May 1994 from a facility near Columbus,
   Ohio, USA. A field previously planted to strawberries was selected near
   The Ohio State University campus in Columbus. Main treatments were
   fumigated methyl bromide (MeBr) and non fumigated with sub plots of: 1)
   control - no CYW 2) CYW on the soil surface 3) CYW incorporated 10 cm
   into the soil and 4) CYW - incorporated 10 cm into the soil and surface
   applied. All compost amounts were placed in a band 2.5 cm deep and 30 cm
   wide. Measurement of soil physical properties 3 yr. after CYW
   application indicated that CYW improved soil structure. All CYW
   treatments significantly decreased soil bulk density. The CYW
   incorporated decreased the percentage water-filled soil pore space and
   therefore increased aeration. Surface applied CYW increased soil
   respiration, indicating increased biological activity. Both the surface
   and subsurface applied CYW increased soil water holding capacity and
   speed of water infiltration. Fumigation increased the number of plants
   per plot. Non fumigated CYW plants had more multiple crowns than
   fumigated but this difference was not significant.}},

Abstract = {{Correlation between vegetation composition, soil quality, and grazing
   since the introduction of pastoralism, were investigated on mid-altitude
   Brown Soils in the Ids Valley, Central Otago, New Zealand. Sampling
   sites were chosen to minimise the effects of environmental variation
   whilst maximising differences in vegetation as a consequence of
   long-term (100+ years) pastoralism (e.g. either side of fence lines).
   Gradient analysis was used to order 31 sites and the underlying gradient
   was identified through correlation with site factors and management
   information. A pattern of vegetation change along the first gradient
   (unrelated to altitude or aspect) showed dense Chionochloa rubra (red
   tussock) present where grazing intensities had been lowest. Induced
   mixed short fescue tussock (Festuca spp.) and adventive grass were
   present in the middle of the gradient, whilst Hieracium pilosella
   (mouse-ear hawkweed) dominated those sites where long-term (100 year+)
   grazing intensities had been highest. H. pilosella invasion is viewed
   not as a consequence of current grazing intensities, but rather invasion
   has occurred at a faster rate and more completely into vegetation types
   where long-term grazing intensities have been greatest.
   Soil physical properties showed lower total porosity, macroporosity, and
   water content, and higher bulk density, with vegetation composition
   associated with higher long-term grazing intensities. Soil biological
   properties also showed lower hot water extracted carbon (labile C) and
   anaerobically mineralisable N in these soils, although the pattern for
   the latter was not consistent across all fence lines.
   It was concluded that vegetation change accompanied by a loss of
   desirable soil properties has been greatest where long-term grazing
   intensities have been highest. This loss of properties may be affecting
   the ability of some plants to grow and survive drought. It is not known
   if soil changes are in equilibrium with vegetation changes.}},

Abstract = {{The serious soil erosion of the Loess Plateau has deteriorated the soil
   fertility and soil quality and has changed the Loess Plateau into a low
   yield district of grain production. We studied soil nutrient loss, soil
   physical property degeneration, and soil enzyme reduction in a field and
   laboratory investigation. When fertilizer was not used, and land slope
   increased from 4 to 16 degrees, the loss of organic matter increased
   from 108 kg/ha to 210 kg/ha, total nitrogen from 15 kg/ha to 26 kg/ha,
   and total phosphorus from 4.41 kg/ha to 13.3 kg/ha. This leads to
   barrenness, coarseness, and calcification. Because grain size (<0.01 mm)
   is only 21.5\%, equal to half that of 16 degrees, the fraction of soil
   aggregates is reduced, and there is a drop in amylase as slope
   increases. On the basis of the above, we made a comprehensive assessment
   on the environment quality of erosive soil and divided the quality into
   five grades, i.e., good, fairly good, poor, extremely poor, and
   deteriorated. This scheme provided a scientific basis for remaking and
   using the soil resource.}},

Abstract = {{On-site impact of soil erosion is difficult to assess at local,
   regional, and global scales. The presently available information is
   based on a wide range of nonstandardized methods, incomplete and
   unreliable data, lack of information on the uneroded state of the soil
   and trends in erosion-induced changes in soil quality, and
   non-availability of precise cost of all losses (e.g., plant nutrients,
   water, soil organic matter content). Currently used methods of assessing
   the on-site impacts can be broadly grouped under three categories:
   agronomic/soil evaluation, economic assessment, and social surveys.
   Agronomic methods involve greenhouse and field experiments to relate
   erosion-induced changes in soil. quality to agronomic productivity.
   Among these, a reliable technique is to establish field plots on soils
   with different severity of past erosion. Different erosional phases must
   be located on the same landscape position, and soil information on the
   uneroded reference soil must be available. Economic analyses of on-site
   impact involve assessment of losses of plant available nutrients and
   water and other additional inputs needed due to erosion. Knowledge
   surveys are based on ``a structural informed opinion analysis{''} and
   are a qualitative substitute for locations where quantitative data are
   not available. These diverse approaches lead to a wide range of
   estimates of the on-site impacts. Consequently, the results obtained are
   not comparable and lead to conflicting views and debatable conclusions.
   There is a strong need to establish coordinated and long-term field
   experiments on principal soils and major ecoregions to evaluate effects
   of erosion-induced changes in soil quality and productivity. These
   experiments should be conducted with standardized methods, and scaling
   procedures should be developed to extrapolate the data from soilscape to
   regional and global scales.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The present world population of 6 billion will reach 8 billion by 2020
   and 9.4 billion by 2050. By then, the population will have increased by
   another 575 million in India, 300 million in China, 200 million in
   Nigeria, 200 million in Pakistan, and 140 million in Ethiopia. Of the
   total world population, 8.2 billion will live in developing countries,
   of which 3 billion will reside in arid and semiarid environments. Thus,
   soil management challenges for developing countries include achieving
   food security with minimal risks to environment given per capita land
   area decreasing to <0.1 ha and per capita irrigated land area to <0.04
   ha, severe scarcity of renewable fresh water resources, high risks of
   soil degradation by a wide range of degradative processes, resource-poor
   farmers, and weak institutional support. Productivity loss attributable
   to erosion-caused soil degradation is estimated at 18 million Mg of food
   staples per year at the 1990 level of yields for subSaharan Africa and
   272 million Mg for the world at the 1996 level of production. The
   productivity loss at a landscape level may range from 0 (or even
   positive effect) to total crop failure. In addition to enhancing
   productivity per unit area and per unit time, soil management
   technologies must also address pressing environmental issues, especially
   with regard to the greenhouse effect and air quality, water quality, and
   land application of industrial and urban wastes. Enhancing food
   production would necessitate adoption of land saving technologies
   through agricultural intensification on prime agricultural land,
   conversion of marginal lands to other appropriate land uses, and
   restoration of degraded lands and ecosystems. Soil-specific technologies
   for agricultural intensification will have to be developed, fine-tuned,
   and adopted. These technologies will address the issue of (i) enhancing
   soil structure, (ii) increasing nutrient use efficiency through
   integrated nutrient management and strengthening nutrient recycling
   mechanisms, (iii) conserving soil and water through residue management
   and adoption of conservation tillage, (iv) improving water use
   efficiency through development and adoption of efficient methods of
   water harvesting, recycling and irrigation, and (v) increasing cropping
   intensity. Improvements in rainfed agriculture through water
   conservation and enhancing water and nutrient use efficiencies will be a
   major challenge in subSaharan Africa, India, Central Asian countries,
   northeastern Brazil, and other semiarid regions of the developing world.
   Preventing and restoring degraded soils, enhancing soil C sequestration
   to mitigate the greenhouse effect, and decreasing risks of
   eutrophication of surface water and contamination of ground water will
   be priority issues. Soil scientists will need to work closely with those
   in the basic sciences to address the environmental concerns of
   agricultural intensification. There is a strong need for high quality,
   credible, innovative, original, and demand-driven research in soil
   science in developing countries. Research managers can facilitate
   achievements of goals of high quality science by creating a conducive
   and trustworthy work atmosphere and by rewarding productivity and merit.}},

Abstract = {{Information on soil conditions in New Zealand is needed to assess soil
   quality at a national scale. We tested a standard set of 16 primary
   indicators at 29 sites (0-10 cm depth) across nine soil great groups
   with matched examples of indigenous forest, plantation forest, pastures,
   and crops. Soils under indigenous forest were acidic (pH 5.55.7), low in
   Olsen P (5-14 mu g cm(-3)), with high microbial C (814-1228 mu g.
   cm(-3)), respiration (1.1-1.4 mu g C cm(-3) h(-1)), total C (31.8-52.9
   mg cm(-3)), macroporosity (9.6-11.7\% v/v), and total available water
   (29.2-31.5\% v/v). Plantation forest soils had generally similar
   characteristics. Pasture soils were less acidic (pH 5.3-6.9) than forest
   soils, but with more available P (5.5-43.0 mu g cm(-3)), higher total C
   (30.7-141.5 mg cm-3), total N (2.7-9.0 mg cm(-3)), and mineralizable N
   (68-175 mu g cm(-3)). The physical condition was similar to forest
   soils. Cropped soil had low total C (20-34 mg cm(-3)), microbial C
   (160-956 mu g cm(-3)), respiration (0.29-1.33 mu g C cm(-3) h(-1)), and
   total available water (6.7-30.1\% v/v), but high pH (5.8-7.2), Olsen P
   (11.2-199 mu g cm-3), and hulk density (0.96-1.3 g cm(-3)). Principal
   component analysis identified outlier sites and grouped land uses
   independently of soil great groups. Some indicators were less useful
   because of high variability (unsaturated hydraulic conductivity),
   correlation to other indicators (microbial C) or interpretation
   difficulties (respiration). Overall, the standardized approach provided
   useful information about soil conditions on a national scale.}},

Abstract = {{Adoption of reduced-tillage fallow systems in the western USA is limited
   by winter annual grass weeds such as downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.).
   Moldboard plowing is an effective means of controlling downy brome in
   winter wheat (Tritcum aestivum L.)-fallow systems. The purpose of this
   study was to assess the influence of plowing and secondary tillage
   operations, for the purpose of weed control, on soil quality attributes
   of a silt loam soil that had been cropped in a sub-till or no-till (NT)
   winter wheat-fallow system for more than 20 yr. Compared with
   undisturbed NT, downy brome populations in plowed NT decreased 97 and
   41\% in the first and third crops following tillage, respectively. Wheat
   yields in plowed NT treatments were 30 and 9\% greater in the first and
   third crops following tillage, respectively, compared with undisturbed
   NT. Soil quality indicators assessed were organic C (OC), total N,
   inorganic N, pH, electrical conductivity, bulk density, water
   infiltration rate, and pore-size distribution. Five years after tillage,
   soil OC decline in the 0- to 7.5-cm depth was 20\% in plowed compared
   with undisturbed NT; however, OC increased 15\% in the 7.5- to 15-cm
   depth and was not different in the 0- to 30-cm depth. Total soil N
   followed similar trends. Soil inorganic N in plowed NT decreased 37\%,
   and soil pH increased 9\%, compared with undisturbed NT, at the 0- to
   7.5-cm depth. Occasional tillage with the moldboard plow in a reduced-
   or no-tillage management system will help control winter annual grass
   weeds, while retaining many of the soil quality benefits of
   conservation-tillage management.}},

Abstract = {{In Portugal animal production represents more than half of the total
   agricultural production. Pig production, which represents 41\% of animal
   production, is located near the large population centres. That
   contribute to the transfer to Alentejo rural region in South of
   Portugal, of this production. Alentejo has problems concerning to the
   climate conditions for pig production and soil quality so the outdoor
   housing system seems to be a good solution to solve that problems.
   The outdoor system, which is described in this paper, is based on
   multiple zones adapted to the reproduction cycle, i.e., open groups pens
   for culled sows, dry sows and boars, open individually or group pens for
   pregnant sows, closed individually farrowing pens spread in a large open
   zone. Recent developments indicate that this system permits obtaining
   good reproductive performances when compared with intensive production
   systems characterised by complex environmental control systems, with the
   advantage of reducing the production costs.
   Concerning the rearing and fattening houses it is possible to use
   semi-open and open systems without seriously affecting growth
   performances when compared with close environmental control systems,
   providing a more ``natural{''} pork meat.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes technical efficiency in Oman using the stochastic
   production frontier and the data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods.
   Different methods are used because the determinants of technical
   efficiency may be influenced by the method used and also by the
   assumptions (such as returns to scale) maintained. Results from the
   stochastic parametric frontier (SPF) and DEA-Charnes, Cooper, Rhodes
   (CCR) models show that the percentage of farmers that could qualify as
   technically efficient is as low as 17\%. When the DEA-Banker, Charnes,
   Cooper (BCC) method was used, this percentage increased to about 46\%.
   Factors such as off-farm income and soil quality were found to be
   positively correlated to productivity. On the other hand, small farm
   size and farmer's age showed a negative relationship with productivity.

Abstract = {{Temporal variations in soil microbial biomass C concentration and in
   activity of extracellular enzymes of the cellulolytic complex were
   investigated in a field experiment after eight years of cultivation with
   either low organic matter input (low-OM) or high organic matter input
   (high-OM). The cultivation systems differed in whether their source of
   fertiliser was mainly mineral or organic, in whether a winter cover crop
   was grown, and whether straw was mulched or removed. Sampling occurred
   at approximately monthly intervals, over a period of two years. Distinct
   temporal variations in microbial biomass C concentration and activity of
   extracellular enzymes of the cellulolytic complex were observed. The
   temporal pattern was generally similar in the low-OM and high-OM
   cultivation systems. Temporal variations may have been driven by
   environmental factors (e.g., temperature and moisture) and crop growth,
   i.e. by factors common to both systems but not differences in organic
   matter input. Pronounced and constant increases in beta-glucosidase
   activity (40\%) and endocellulase activity (30\%) in high-OM were
   detected across all sampling periods. The increases in microbial biomass
   C concentration and cellobiohydrolase activity varied over the sampling
   periods (0-60\% and 24-92\%, respectively). Over the experimental period
   a mean of 148 +/- 6.0 mu g biomass C g(-1), a beta-glucosidase activity
   of 123 +/- 3.3 nmol g(-1) h(-1), a cellobiohydrolase activity of 122 +/-
   2.4 nmol g(-1) h(-1) and an endocellulase activity of 33.8 +/- 0.9 nmol
   g(-1) h(-1) were recorded in the low-OM soil (0-20 cm). The
   corresponding means in the high-OM treatment were 189 +/- 6.6 mu g
   biomass C g(-1), a beta-glucosidase activity of 174 +/- 4.1 nmol g(-1)
   h(-1), a cellobiohydrolase activity of 173 +/- 3.4 nmol g(-1) h(-1) and

Abstract = {{This paper studies the dynamic aspects related to the problem of
   acidification. It shows how accumulation of acidification in ecosystems
   can be studied in economic modelling by incorporating dynamic aspects of
   soil acidification. In contrast to the often applied critical loads
   approach which only focuses on the final state of a soil, the dynamic
   approach applied in this study gives information about the temporal
   development of the quality of a soil. Using an economic optimal control
   model containing these dynamic aspects the paper compares abatement
   policies based on static critical loads to abatement policies based on a
   dynamic analysis. It shows that soil dynamics play an essential role in
   identifying optimal policies. Based on numerical simulations
   cost-effective abatement strategies for combined reduction of sulphur
   dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are determined. It is also shown
   that abatement cost savings may be realised when intertemporal cost
   efficiency is taken into account. The results indicate that current
   European policies which are based on a critical loads approach instead
   of dynamic analysis of soil quality, are non-optimal from both an
   ecological and an economic point of view. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The stabilization of organic matter in soil by interaction with
   aluminium (Al) or allophane is important in maintaining soil quality,
   and in retarding the decomposition of soil organic matter. Complexation
   of Al by soil organic matter may also ameliorate Al toxicity. Here we
   use C-13-NMR spectroscopy to assess the interaction of soil organic
   matter with both Al and allophane in two poorly drained podzols
   containing only trace amounts of iron. The C-13-NMR spectrum of the
   subsoil of the allophane-rich One Tree Point podzol shows an intense
   peak at 179 p.p.m., assigned to carbon in carboxylic acids. This peak
   shifts to 177 p.p.m. after removal of allophane (11\% of the soil mass)
   by treatment with HF. We infer that the carboxyl groups in the organic
   matter are bonded to structural Al on the surface of allophane
   spherules. In the non-allophanic Te Kopuru podzol, on the other hand,
   the organic matter apparently interacts with Al ions in the soil
   solution. This soil also has more aromatic carbon and fewer carbons in
   carboxyl and carbohydrate structures than the allophanic sample. There
   is an indication that allophane stabilizes carbohydrate groups as well
   as carboxyl groups.}},

Abstract = {{1. We present data on the gas exchange of 32 Beech-Spruce model
   ecosystems including understorey species, which were planted on acidic
   or calcareous soil in 16 (half-split) open-top chambers in 1994 and were
   continuously exposed to the combinations of two CO2 concentrations and
   two wet nitrogen deposition rates for 3 years.
   2. Instantaneous mid-season net ecosystem carbon-exchange rates (NEC)
   were determined during the day (11.00-16.00 h, NECd) and at night
   (22.00-02.00 h, NECn) with a mobile chamber in July 1996 and August 1997
   for both soil types and, in addition, in August and September 1996 on
   acidic soil only.
   3. Elevated CO2 increased NECd at all sampling dates on both soil types
   and under both N deposition rates. Increased nitrogen deposition
   stimulated NECd on acidic soil but not on calcareous soil, irrespective
   of the CO2 level. NECn was increased in elevated CO2 on both soil types
   (but more on the calcareous soil), but did not respond to increased
   nitrogen deposition in both years. The daytime instantaneous ecosystem
   evapotranspiration (ETd) was not significantly affected by the CO2 and
   nitrogen treatments at any sampling date. Year to year differences in
   NECn and ETd were small, but a doubling in NECd occurred throughout the
   observation period.
   4. Elevated CO2 caused a small but significant increase in stem dry mass
   on calcareous soil only and increased nitrogen deposition stimulated
   stem biomass production on acidic soil only. Leaf area index was not
   affected by CO2, but was increased under high nitrogen deposition.
   5. Our results suggest that nitrogen deposition and soil type are major
   co-determinants of the carbon balance of forests in a future CO2-rich
   world.}},

Abstract = {{In general, risk assessments of urban soil pollution are prepared by
   comparing the levels of pollutants with soil quality criteria. However,
   large urban areas are contaminated with concentrations of pollutants far
   exceeding the existing soil quality criteria and would consequently be
   considered to be of potential risk to humans. This is, however, a rather
   rigid approach, and for risk management purposes it would be desirable
   to have more than just one level of soil quality criteria. Therefore, a
   generic risk assessment model was developed for five different use
   scenarios: child-care centers, kitchen gardens, ornamental gardens,
   parks, and sports grounds, In each of the scenarios, three different
   types of expected behavior are described for children and adults,
   respectively, resulting in different levels of exposure to the
   pollutants. For risk management purposes, various guidance values can
   then be derived for each use scenario, Below a lower guidance value, a
   free use of the area according to the defined use is possible without an
   unacceptable risk to the public. Above an upper value, a cutoff of the
   exposure is necessary. In between, the use may be regulated by different
   types of advice. The model is still preliminary but was, however, used
   for derivation of guidance values for five commonly found soil
   pollutants, of which the results for benzo{[}a]pyrene and lead are
   presented. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the effect of the addition of the organic fraction of
   municipal solid waste at two different rates on the microbiological and
   biochemical properties of an arid soil after 8 years. The vegetation
   that appeared spontaneously just after the amendment was still present 8
   years later. The organic matter fractions were higher in the amended
   soil than in the control soil. Amended soil showed higher values of
   microbial biomass C, soil basal respiration and dehydrogenase activity
   than control soil, which reached values near to those of the natural
   soils in the area. The organic amendment had a positive effect on the
   activity of enzymes related with C, N, P cycles, particularly when the
   amendment was at the highest dose. This effect could be also observed on
   the activity of extracted enzymes. The results indicated that the
   addition of urban waste could be a suitable technique with which to
   restore soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the quantity and quality of soil organic carbon, and their
   effect on soil aggregate stability as a result of growing different
   crops in rotation with wheat, were investigated on a red earth (Oxic
   Paleustalf) in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia. After two cycles
   of the 1:1 rotation, while the total organic carbon in the 0-5cm soil
   depth was similar (15.1 g/kg), significant differences in water stable
   aggregation were observed in the order: wheat/lupin = wheat/barley >
   wheat/canola > wheat/field pea. Using a selective extraction technique,
   significant differences in the quality (composition) of the soil organic
   carbon were detected in the soils from the different rotations. Soil
   from the lupin rotation had the highest salt- and acid-extractable
   carbon whereas that from the barley rotation had the highest level of
   hot-water-extractable carbon and microbial biomass carbon. Rather than
   total carbon or other extractable fractions, the observed differences in
   aggregate stability were only significantly (P<0.05) related to
   microbial biomass carbon, which made up only 1.3-1.7\% of the total
   carbon pool. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that with the
   exception of salt-extractable carbon, inclusion of any other of the less
   labile fractions failed to improve the correlation relationship. The
   labile nature of the microbial biomass carbon therefore accounted for
   the transient existence of the differences in aggregate stability under
   different rotation crops. The latter was found to be transient and
   disappeared at the end of the subsequent wheat crop.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in some soil biochemical properties were investigated following
   repeated applications of aerobically digested sewage sludge (SS) under
   field conditions over 12 years, and compared with those of an adjacent
   soil cultivated and amended with 5 t ha(-1) year(-1) (dry weight)
   farmyard manure (FYM) for at least 40 years, as well as with those of an
   adjacent uncultivated soil, in order to ascertain changes in soil
   quality. A short-term aerobic incubation was used to determine the
   potential of the samples to mineralize the organic C supplied. Results
   indicated that cultivation caused a reduction in total, humified and
   potentially mineralizable organic C, total N, light-fraction (LF) C,
   total and water-soluble carbohydrates, phenolic compounds,
   cation-exchange capacity (CEC), microbial biomass C, specific
   respiration, hydrolytic and urease activities, and an increase in the
   heavy metal content. Total and water-soluble carbohydrates and phenolic
   compounds expressed as a percentage of total organic C (TOC) were
   similar in the differently managed plots. Of the two amendments, FYM
   treatments showed higher amounts of TOC and N, LF-C, total and
   water-soluble carbohydrates, phenolic substances, CEC, specific
   respiration of biomass, hydrolytic and urease activities, similar
   amounts and characteristics of humified organic matter and lower
   concentrations of Cu, Zn and Cr. Both FYM and SS were inadequate
   treatments for the restoration of soil organic matter lost as a
   consequence of cultivation.}},

Abstract = {{The native soils of Galicia (NW Spain) exhibit a biochemical equilibrium
   such that total soil N is a function of five biochemical and
   microbiological parameters: microbial biomass C, mineralized N,
   phosphomonoesterase, beta-glucosidase and urease activities. To
   investigate whether the ratio of the total N calculated from biochemical
   soil properties (Nc) and the total N as measured by the Kjeldahl method
   (Nk; Nc/Nk) can be used as an index of soil quality, we determined these
   variables and consequently the ratio in three kinds of disturbed soils:
   an artificially Cu-contaminated soil, two lignite mine soils, and a
   number of arable soils. In none of the studied soils did the individual
   biochemical parameters respond consistently to the factors influencing
   soil quality, but in all cases soil degradation was reflected by the
   Nc/Nk value, which differed more or less markedly from 100\%. Nc/Nk can
   therefore be used for the rapid evaluation of soil degradation, since it
   distinguishes among biochemically balanced soils, soils in a transient
   state of high microbiological and biochemical activity and degraded
   soils. It can also serve as a reliable basis for the rapid calculation
   of the ``ecological dose{''} (ED50) Of soil pollutants. The use of Nc/Nk
   as an objective index of the biochemical quality of soils is
   recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Sludge amendments increase the input of carbon and nutrients to the
   soil. However, the soil concentrations of heavy metals and xenobiotica
   can also increase due to sludge amendments, with possible effects on
   soil microorganisms and soil fertility. Therefore, we studied the
   effects on soil microorganisms and soil chemistry in two arable soils
   after 12 and 16 years of sewage sludge amendment (0, 1 and 3 dry matter
   ha(-1) year(-1)). The sludge amendments were combined with nitrogen
   addition at three rates according to crop requirements, and all
   combinations were replicated 4 times, giving a total number of 36
   parcels at each experimental site in a non-randomised block design.
   Univariate data evaluation as well as principal component analysis and
   discriminant function analysis (DFA) were used to identify differences
   between treatments in microbial and chemical parameters. The DFA showed
   that acid and alkaline phosphatase, potential ammonium oxidation and
   total nitrogen were the most important parameters to discriminate
   between a priori defined groups of sludge treatments. Among the heavy
   metals, copper showed the highest increase in soil concentration with
   sludge amendments, but this increase was still not high enough to have a
   significant influence on the measured parameters. None of the
   xenobiotica investigated was found in high soil concentrations. In
   conclusion, the present study showed that the sewage sludge affected
   several of the biological and chemical parameters investigated. However,
   no severe negative effects on soil microorganisms were detected at these
   moderate levels of sludge amendment.}},

Abstract = {{Soil microbial biomass (SMB) measurements are often used in soil
   biological analysis; however, their interpretation can be problematic.
   In this review, both the limitations and benefits of indirect (both
   CHCl3 fumigation incubation and fumigation extraction, and
   substrate-induced respiration) SMB measurements are outlined, along with
   their value and interpretation as attributes or indicators to assess
   some soil quality (SQ) functions (e.g., enhance plant growth, maintain
   aggregation, regulate energy) for mainly humid, temperate soils, with
   specific emphasis on research conducted in eastern Canada and New
   Zealand. Indirect SMB methods are subject to limitations analogous to
   ``soil test{''} procedures (e.g., soil sampling and handling, water
   content, storage prior to treatment), and also the difficulties with
   establishing an acceptable ``control{''} and fraction (i.e., k value) of
   SMB mineralized or extracted. In many cases, such limitations present a
   need for some degree of standardization (e.g., pre-conditions of 7- to
   10-d incubation at 25 degrees C and -0.001 MPa water potential) prior to
   SMB measurement. However, for SQ assessment, where ``comparative{''}
   rather than ``absolute{''} values of SMB are often of interest use of
   commonly derived k values seem appropriate for surface soils.
   Soil ecological factors govern SMB and often underlie much of the
   spatial and temporal variation in SMB. Plant species composition, mainly
   through net primary productivity and litter quality, can: affect SMB
   measurements along with trophic cascades in soil, where interactions
   among soil organisms can influence microbial activity. Benefits of SMB
   measurements relate mainly to the assessment of both soil C turnover and
   management induced changes in organic matter. The combination of SMB and
   delta(13)C to elucidate the transformations and fate of organic C in
   cropping and soil management systems has also shown that both temporal
   and spatial redistribution of C inputs, and soil type (i.e., particle
   size distribution) are dominant factors in turnover and nutrient flow
   through the SMB.
   For SQ assessment, SMB is not a useful indicator for the function of
   soil as a ``medium for plant growth{''} in regard to plant productivity
   for intensively farmed temperate soils. For the function of soil to
   ``maintain aggregation{''}, where SMB is one agent only of a
   multi-faceted process, the relationship between SMB and soil aggregation
   is not always present and tends to be site-specific. In regard to the
   ``regulate energy{''} soil function, SMB is related to some degree with
   decomposition and mineralization processes. The main role of SMB for SQ
   assessment is to serve within a minimum data set of other indicators
   (e.g., macroorganic C) to monitor soil organic C storage and change.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial biomass, as part of the active pool of soil organic matter, is
   critical in decomposition of organic materials, nutrient cycling, and
   formation of soil structure. We evaluated chloroform
   fumigation-incubation with subtraction of a control (CFI/F-C) and
   without subtraction of a control (CFI/F) as methods to assess biological
   soil quality. Relationships between CFI/F and:potential C
   mineralization, particulate organic C, and soil organic C were stronger
   (r(2) = 0.86 +/- 0.07, n = 232) than those between CFI/F-C and the same
   soil C pools (r(2) = 0.25 +/- 0.09) in soils from Georgia. From
   published data, relationships of CFI/F with potential C mineralization
   and soil organic C were stronger than those of chloroform
   fumigation-extraction and substrate-induced respiration with these soil
   C pools. Effects of land management on biological soil quality using
   CFI/F were consistent with those determined using other soil C pools as
   response variables. However, land management effects on biological soil
   quality using CFI/F-C were either contrary to those using other soil C
   pools or not detectable because of greater inherent variability in
   CFI/F-C. Chloroform fumigation-incubation without subtraction of a
   control is a robust and reliable method to assess biological soil

Abstract = {{Although approximately 1.3 million ha of mixed Solonetzic - Chemozemic
   landscapes are cultivated in Saskatchewan, little information is
   available on the effects that agriculture has had on the quality of
   these soils. At bur research site in southwestern Saskatchewan a clear
   landscape-scale pattern of soil distribution occurred. Regosolic and
   thin Chernozemic soils were associated with the long, gentle (2-5\%)
   slopes and Solonetzic-influenced soils were associated with higher
   catchment area footslope and depressional positions. High rates of soil
   loss occurred throughout the landscape - overall a net soil loss of 31
   Mg ha yr(-1) was calculated using Cs-137 redistribution techniques. No
   net depositional sires were observed in the 45 sampling points in the
   landscape, suggesting that the site was dominated by wind erosion. The
   high rates of loss were consistent with very low levels of soil organic
   carbon storage (37 to 46 Mg ha(-1) to 45 cm) at all slope positions in
   the landscape and with the occurrence of sub-soil features in the plough
   layer. The Solonetzic-influenced soils occupy 38\% of the site and have
   high sodium adsorption ratios (from 18 to 38 in the B horizon) and high
   soil resistance values as determined with a penetrometer. For the
   Solonetz and Solodized Solonetz soils these growth-limiting properties
   occur immediately below the 10-cm plough layer and may constitute a
   largely irreversible decrease in their productive capacity.}},

Abstract = {{2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) is an worldwide recalcitrant environmental
   contaminant and is toxic to a number of organisms including humans. This
   study examines the acute effects (lethal and biomass changes) of TNT on
   the oligochaetes species Eisenia andrei, using the 3-day filter paper,
   and the 7- and 14-day direct contact spiked soil (OECD artificial and
   forest soil) toxicity tests. Studies using the filter paper test
   indicated that the lethality of TNT could be detected in the range 1.5
   to 14.2 mu g/cm(2), with significant biomass (body weight) changes
   occurring at the lowest concentration. Acute effects (lethality) could
   not be measured when earthworms were placed on filter paper containing a
   saturated aqueous solution of TNT. This may indicate that with these
   exposure conditions, TNT may have been adsorbed to the filter paper, and
   that this matrix should be saturated with TNT before becoming available
   to the earthworms. Spiked soil toxicity tests indicated that the E.
   andrei lethality by TNT was > 1.5 times higher when earthworms were
   exposed to TNT-spiked forest soil (LOEC:260 mg/kg; LC50 14 days 222.4
   mg/kg) than to spiked OECD artificial soil (LOEC:420 mg/kg; LC50 14
   days: 364.9 mg/kg). The sublethal effect on biomass change at the
   selected TNT concentrations in soil was not significant compared to
   controls. Results indicate that the bioanalytical methods described in
   this article could be used as TNT toxicity assessment tools. This soil
   quality test method gives valuable information for the screening of soil
   toxicity. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Three soil fertility management practices relevant to smallhold farming
   systems in the East African Highlands were tested in an 18 yr-old
   experiment on a humic nitisol (Kikuyu Red Clay) under a maize-bean
   rotation. These practices were the addition of mineral fertilizers (120
   kg N and 52 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)), application of cattle manure (10 t
   ha(-1) yr(-1)) and retention of maize stover. Eight treatments arranged
   as a 2x2 x2 factorial were examined for their effects on crop yield,
   soil organic matter (SOM) fractions and soil chemical properties. Total
   crop yields of maize and beans ranged between 1.4 t ha(-1) yr(-1) when
   maize stover was retained without external inputs to 6.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1)
   when stover was retained and fertilizers and manure applied. Soil
   organic C contents to a depth of 15 cm ranged between 23.6 t ha(-1)
   (14.3 mg g(-1)) with combined addition of mineral fertilizers and stover
   removal to 28.7 t ha(-1) (17.4 mg g(-1)) with chemical fertilization,
   manuring and stover retention. Differences in particulate organic matter
   and microbial biomass among treatments were proportionately larger than
   changes in total soil organic carbon. All land managements resulted in
   an overall decline in SOM over time and the greatest average rate of
   loss, 557 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1), was observed with fertilization and crop
   residue removal. Addition of manure and retention of maize stover
   reduced this loss by 49\%. Carbon balances suggest that particulate
   organic matter is more efficiently restocked by manure than maize
   stover. Particulate organic matter is a key fraction for understanding
   soil fertility changes in humic nitisols of the Kenyan Highlands and has
   potential for use as an indicator of soil quality. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Ploughless soil tillage impacts on yields and selected soil quality
   parameters is reviewed from the Scandinavian countries of Denmark,
   Finland, Norway and Sweden. Soil conditions as well as climatic
   conditions vary widely, this resulting in variations in the length of
   the growing season, which is very short in the northern part of
   Scandinavia. The success of reduced tillage and direct drilling depends
   on the crop species as well as on the soil type and the climatic
   conditions. The best results seem to be obtained on the heaviest clay
   soils, which is the most difficult soils to prepare with conventional
   soil tillage methods. Satisfactory yields were obtained after ploughless
   tillage in winter wheat (Triticum sp,), winter oil seed rape (Brassica
   sp.) and late harvested potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.). The influence
   of crop rotations and preceding crops in ploughless tillage systems for
   small grain cereals has received relatively little attention. Also,
   fertilization of reduced tilled crops has received too little attention,
   but it seems that nitrogen cannot compensate for sub-optimal tillage.
   One of the most striking effects of ploughless tillage is the increased
   density of the soil just beneath the depth of tillage. Increased soil
   density decreased the volume of macropores (>30-60 mu m) and increased
   the volume of medium pores (30-0.2 mu m), but the volume of small pores
   (<0.2 mu m) was only little affected by soil tillage. Increased soil
   bulk density reduced the air-filled porosity, the air diffusivity and
   the air permeability as well as the hydraulic conductivity, and
   sometimes the root development. More plant residues were left on or near
   the soil surface after ploughless tillage, which led to lower
   evapotranspiration and higher content of soil water in the upper (0-10
   cm) soil layer. It also led to lower soil temperature, and more stable
   soil aggregates which provided better protection of the soil against
   erosion. Nutrients and organic matter accumulated near the soil surface
   after ploughless tillage, and in the long run the soil reaction (pH)
   declined. Nearly all species of earthworms increased in number in
   ploughless tillage. The leaching of nitrogen seemed to increase with
   more intensive cultivation, particularly when carried out in autumn. (C)

Abstract = {{Tillage practices and weather affect the release of greenhouse gases but
   there have been few integrated studies of the quantities released or the
   mechanisms involved. No-tillage may increase emissions of nitrous oxide
   (N(2)O) and the fixation of carbon by decreasing carbon dioxide (CO(2))
   emissions. Tillage may also decrease the oxidation rate of atmospheric
   methane (CH(4)) in aerobic soil. These effects are partly due to
   compaction and to the lack of both soil disturbance and residue
   incorporation. Our objective was to investigate how tillage practices,
   soil conditions and weather interact to influence greenhouse gas
   emissions. Here we present early measurements of N(2)O and CO(2)
   emission and CH(4) oxidation in two field experiments in Scotland under
   a cool moist climate, one involving soil compaction plus residue
   incorporation and the other involving no-tillage and two depths of
   mouldboard ploughing of a former grass sward, The experiments were
   located 10-15 km south of Edinburgh on a cambisol and a gleysol. In
   order to monitor emissions regularly, at short intervals and over long
   periods, a novel automatic gas sampling system which allows subsequent
   automated determination of both N(2)O and CO(2) fluxes was used. Both
   N(2)O and CO(2) fluxes were episodic and strongly dependent on rainfall.
   Peak N(2)O emissions were mainly associated with heavy rainfalls after
   fertilisation, particularly with no-tilled and compact soils. In the
   tillage experiment, N(2)O fluxes and treatment differences were greater
   under spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (up to 600 g N ha(-1) per day)
   than under winter barley. CO(2) emissions in the few weeks after sowing
   were not strongly influenced by tillage and diurnal variations were
   related to soil temperature. However, periods of low or zero CO(2)
   fluxes and very high N(2)O fluxes under no-tillage were associated with
   reduced gas diffusivity and air-filled porosity, both caused by heavy
   rainfall. Early results show that CH(4) oxidation rates may best be
   preserved by no-tillage. The quality of the loam/clay-loams and the
   climate in these experiments makes ploughing, preferably to 300 mm
   depth, and the control of compaction necessary to minimise soil N(2)O
   and CO(2) losses. The gas exchange response of different soil types to
   tillage, particularly methane oxidation rate which is affected by
   long-term soil structural damage, is a potentially useful aspect of soil
   quality when taken in conjunction with other qualities. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Improvement in soil quality to maintain high production and reduce
   negative environmental impacts is necessary for alternative crop
   production strategies to become socially acceptable and viable in the
   long-term. No-tillage (NT) management of the predominantly small grain
   region of western Canada has the potential to curb soil erosion and
   increase profitability. An understanding of the direct effects of NT on
   soil properties is necessary to evaluate its potential for sustained
   long-term productivity. We have compiled data collected from two sites
   in northern British Columbia to ascertain the long-term effects of
   conventional tillage (CT) and NT on soil components thought to be
   important in surface soil structural improvement. Soil water retention
   was greater under NT compared with CT without dramatically altering bulk
   density due to redistribution of pore size classes into more small pores
   and less large pores. Soil organic C was greater under NT than under CT
   nearest the soil surface. Water-stable aggregation improved under NT
   compared with CT, perhaps because more soil organic C was sequestered
   within macroaggregates under NT compared with CT that helped to
   stabilize these aggregates. Steady-state water infiltration was greater
   under NT than under CT as a result of soil structural improvements
   associated with surface residue accumulation and lack of soil
   disturbance. Barley (Hordeum vulgave L.) yield tended to be greater
   under NT than under CT in years of low rainfall as a result of
   improvements in soil water retention and transmission that may have
   provided a better environment for root development. Our data indicate
   that NT is a viable management strategy to improve soil quality in the
   cold, semiarid region of western Canada. This strategy could lead to
   high production, minimal negative environmental impacts, acid a
   socially-acceptable farming system. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Changes in soil physical and chemical properties were evaluated in
   several on-farm studies located in rainfed, hardsetting red Alfisols
   (Ferric Luvisols) and in irrigated, self-mulching Vertisols (Chromic
   Vertisols) of eastern Australia. The objective of the studies was to
   evaluate changes in soil physical and chemical properties with time
   under commercial farming situations where changes had been made to
   previously used farming systems (native pasture to wheat (Triticum sp.)
   cultivation in the hardsetting Alfisols; intensively tilled cotton
   (Gossypium sp.) monoculture to minimum tilled cotton monoculture and
   cotton-wheat sequences in the irrigated Vertisols), The soil physical
   and chemical changes in the Alfisols were caused by changing land use
   from native pasture to intensively tilled wheat cultivation with long
   fallow and stubble burning, whereas those in the Vertisols were caused
   by changing from intensive to minimum tillage in cotton-based cropping
   systems. Indicators of soil physical (tensile strength, structural
   stability, dispersion) and chemical (pH, electrical conductivity,
   organic C, total N) quality evaluated in the Alfisols indicated that a
   significant deterioration in soil quality, which was characterized by an
   increase in hardsetting behaviour and acidity, and a decrease in organic
   C, total N and aggregate stability had occurred. These changes were due
   to inappropriate tillage practices causing soil inversion and the rapid
   breakdown of organic matter which occurs when intensive tillage
   practices are imposed in previously untilled soils. In the Vertisols,
   however, indicators of soil physical (specific volume of air-filled
   pores in oven-dried clods, plastic limit, soil resilience) and chemical
   (pH, electrical conductivity, exchangeable sodium percentage, and soil
   organic C) quality indicated that while deterioration in physical
   quality (i.e., characterized by an increase in compaction) had occurred,
   chemical quality had improved. The latter was characterized by an
   increase in soil organic C and a decrease in exchangeable sodium
   percentage. These changes were due to replacing intensive tillage with
   minimum tillage. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil erosion can adversely influence soil quality, especially in
   tropical soils. Thus, a multi-location field experiment was conducted on
   eight major agricultural soils with different degrees of erosion, in
   three eco-regions in Tanzania. The objective was to assess the impact of
   topsoil depth (TSD) and management on soil properties. Three eco-regions
   comprising of humid at Kilimanjaro, sub-humid at Tanga and
   sub-humid/semi-arid at Morogoro were selected. There were a total of
   eight locations within three eco-regions comprising two at Kilimanjaro
   (e.g., Kirima Bore and Xeno Helena), two at Tanga (Mlingano 1 and
   Mlingano 2) and four at Morogoro (Misufini 1, Misufini 2, Misufini 3,
   and Mindu). The soil management treatments consisted of farmyard manure
   (FYM), N and P fertilizer, tie-ridging and farmers' practice. Plant
   nutrient content was generally lowest on severely eroded and the highest
   on least eroded soil classes. Soil pH decreased with increasing severity
   of erosion on soils with higher content of Ca(+2) in the sub-surface. In
   general, there occurred a decline in soil organic carbon (SOC) and P
   with the decrease in TSD. The SOC content decreased on severely eroded
   soil class by 0.16\%, 0.39\% and 0.13\% at Misufini 1, Mlingano 1 and
   Kirima Bore, respectively, compared to slightly or least eroded soil
   class. Corresponding decline in available P at these sites was 41\%,
   62\% and 61\%, respectively. Application of FYM significantly increased
   soil pH at some sites. Soil content of SOC, N, P, K and Mg were
   significantly increased by FYM application. Significant effects of N and
   P fertilizers on SOC and P were observed at most sites. In comparison
   with farmer's practice, FYM application increased SOC by 0.55\%, N by
   0.03\%, P by six fold and K by two-fold. Nitrogen and phosphorus
   fertilizers had comparable effects for SOC and P only at some sites. The
   results indicate that FYM is a better soil input than N and P
   fertilizers in improving soil quality. The data show that SOC, N and P
   are most adversely affected with accelerated erosion and that FYM
   fertilizer applications have the potential to improve fertility of
   eroded soils. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Farmers lack well documented sets of farm level indicators to allow
   their own evaluation of environmental impact and to stimulate the
   development of more environment friendly farming practices. A set of
   farm level indicators of resource use and environmental impact on
   livestock farms was developed as part of a decision aid for farmers. The
   indicators were meant to be part of an extended farm account and
   included the surpluses and efficiencies of N, P and Cu, the energy use
   per kg grain and per kg milk or meat, pesticide treatment index (TFI),
   \% unsprayed area, \% small biotopes on the farm, and \% weeds in grain
   crops. The indicators were tested on 20 Danish dairy and pig farms over
   a period of 3 years in order to see if they were suitable for use in the
   farmer's management. The third year, farm gate surpluses varied between
   89 and 265 kg N ha(-1), 2 and 31 kg P ha(-1) and 0.1 and 0.8 kg Cu
   ha(-1). Energy use varied between 2.1 and 4.1 MJ kg(-1) milk and between
   14 and 20 MJ kg(-1) live weight pig sold. For all indicators, except
   energy use per kg grain, the variation in indicator levels between farms
   was more important than the variation between years within each farm.
   There was significant variation between farms after correction for
   stocking rates and soil-and farm types, which suggests that the
   indicators reflect differences in management practise on comparable
   farms. It was demonstrated that these differences between similar farms
   and between the years on the individual farms might be explained by the
   detailed knowledge of management of the farms' different subsystems
   (herd and crops). The information given by the indicators is discussed
   from environmental and management points of view and problems of
   defining and interpreting the indicators are identified. Given further
   development of indicators for soil quality and nature values, the farm
   level indicators seem a promising way of enabling farmers to include
   environmental topics in their management. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Background: Current State of the Environment (SoE) reporting focuses
   primarily on indicators directly related to the physical environment
   such as climate, and air, water and soil quality. As the environment has
   both direct and indirect effects on human health, an opportunity exists
   to include environment-related human disease indicators as an SoE
   indicator theme.
   Objective: To develop a set of population health environmental
   indicators (PHEIs, cps) that can illustrate environment-related disease
   (ERD) trends at the population level.
   Methods: A literature review was conducted on environmental health
   monitoring and the current knowledge of environmental effects on human
   health. Key PHEIs were identified and routine health data collections
   accessed and analysed to illustrate temporal and geographic trends.
   Results: Diseases with an environmental aetiology are tabulated and
   examples are given of the type and range of PHEIs that can be developed
   for an Australian geographic area.
   Conclusions: illustrating environmental degradation in terms of
   resultant human diseases is a potent tool for promoting environmental
   protection measures. This paper examines a range of PHEIs that may be
   used as indicators of both environmental disease and environmental
   quality.
   Implications: PHEIs could be developed as a useful SoE indicator theme,
   and as a tool to help foster the convergence which is occurring between
   environmental health and public health fields.}},

Abstract = {{From the Indian national point of view, the importance of coal
   carbonizing industries is great and growing. These industries produce
   huge quantities of highly polluted effluents and discharge them into
   rivers without proper treatment. A large coke plant of Bharat Coking
   Coal Ltd. has been sun eyed, and the impact of its effluent on surface
   water quality is discussed. Approximately 175-200 m(3) of effluents are
   discharged from the plant every day. Land application has been
   considered as a low-cost means of disposal of coke oven effluents.
   Column lysimeters were prepared by collecting soil from a nearby
   agricultural held, putting it layerwise into a column, and compacting it
   carefully to simulate the original in situ conditions. Raw effluents,
   diluted effluent, and water (as a blank) were applied to the three
   lysimeters twice a week with a 5 cm flooding. Upon application of
   diluted effluent (1:1) into lysimeter No. 2, the leachate collected at
   190 cm depth was within the tolerance limit of drinking water standard
   (IS 10,500). The impact of raw and diluted effluent on groundwater
   quality and soil are discussed. The renovation efficiency of Living
   filter (lysimeter No. 2) was 99.37\% for oil and grease, 86.92\% for
   GOD, and 53.22\% for TDS, and it is estimated that 2.73 hectares of land
   can be irrigated with the effluents of the coke plant without
   deteriorating groundwater and soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{In Central-East Poland the number of milk suppliers delivering the
   average value of 5700 l per year to the four biggest dairies, amounts to
   35 500. This figure includes 866 family farms (2.5\%), which also belong
   to the dairy-commodity group, whose supplies exceed 15 000 l of milk a
   year. Questionnaires were used in 146 family farms to carry out a
   technical and economic analysis. The farms have an average area of 18.4
   ha, keep eight cows with a stocking rate of 47 cattle heads/100 ha of
   useable land and sell 27 000 l of milk, which accounts for 39\% of their
   farm sales. Animal production absorbs 22\% of labour input throughout
   the year. It has been observed that production and economic performance
   depend on the soil quality and the share of grassland. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{There is growing recognition for the need to develop sensitive
   indicators of soil quality that reflect the effects of land management
   on soil and assist land managers in promoting long-term sustainability
   of terrestrial ecosystems. Eleven soil enzymes assays were investigated
   relative to soil management and soil quality at two study sites. Soils
   were sampled from the Vegetable Crop Rotation Plots (VRP) (established
   in 1989 in humid western Oregon) which compared continuous fescue
   (Festuca arundinacea) and four winter cover crop treatments in annual
   rotation with a summer vegetable crop. The second site was the Residue
   Utilization Plots (RUP) (initiated in 1931 in semi-arid Eastern Oregon)
   which is under a winter wheat-summer fallow and compared inorganic N,
   green manure and beef manure treatments. Soil also was sampled at the
   research center from a nearby grass pasture that is on the same soil
   type. The enzymes were alpha- and beta-glucosidase, alpha- and
   beta-galactosidase, amidase, arylsulfatase, deaminase, fluorescein
   diacetate hydrolysis, invertase, cellulase and urease. At both sites
   there was a significant treatment effect for each enzyme tested (P <
   0.05). Enzyme activities (except alpha- and beta-glucosidase and alpha-
   and beta-galactosidase) were generally higher in continuous grass fields
   than in cultivated fields. In cultivated systems, activity was higher
   where cover crops or organic residues were added as compared to
   treatments without organic amendments. It was found that use of
   air-dried soil samples provided the same ranking of treatments by a
   number of enzyme assays and would facilitate adoption of these assays
   for practical or commercial applications. Deaminase was not a good
   indicator of soil quality, while beta-glucosidase was suggested as an
   assay that reflects soil management effects and has microbial ecological
   significance because of its role in the C cycle. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In a glasshouse environment, and in field trials with trees up to four
   years of age, the effect of genetic improvement on the early nutrition
   and growth of radiata pine was examined. In the glasshouse trial, on a
   range of forest soils, there was no effect of genetic gain (expressed as
   growth and form rating) on either seedling biomass or nutrient content;
   in field experiments, correlations between genetic gain (breeding value
   and growth and form rating) and growth (height, root collar diameter, or
   both) became: apparent from Age 2 years at both sites. It was concluded
   that the genetic improvement of radiata pine seedlings would not be
   needed to be taken into account if seedlings were to be used before the
   age of six months as `bio-assay' indicators of changes in soil quality.

Abstract = {{New Zealand has signed an international agreement that commits it to
   report on progress towards sustainable forest management as measured by
   indicators grouped within seven criteria. This paper evaluates the role
   of forest productivity in defining the sustainability of plantation
   forests in New Zealand. A key factor dictating the extent of the
   plantation forest industry in New Zealand is profitability. Therefore,
   forest productivity is an important criterion of sustainability because
   of its important relationship with economics and profitability. Another
   important issue is whether plantations could be grown for an indefinite
   number of rotations without adversely affecting the site's capacity for
   biomass production. Where management practices lead to reductions in
   productivity, some form of amelioration is required and, as long as this
   is economically viable the practice is still sustainable. Forest
   productivity is not a good indicator of soil quality because of the
   confounding effects of plantation management. While improved modeling
   techniques may help to overcome this problem, measurement of soil- or
   tree-based indicators may provide a more sensitive measurement of soil
   quality. For a given soil type, if the effect of management practices on
   the soil indicator and the effect of the soil indicator on forest
   productivity were known, then an assessment could be made of the impact
   of various management practices on productivity (or other sustainability
   criteria). This would allow the establishment of management guidelines,
   constraints, and ameliorative requirements necessary to maintain or
   enhance soil quality. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   and applying best management practices that will result in sustainable
   forestry. Maintaining soil productivity is a criterion in most
   sustainability initiatives. The purpose of this paper is to outline the
   steps and rationale of a monitoring approach, using soil-based
   indicators as an example, to assess stand-level sustainability of
   intensively managed forests. The monitoring process, described here,
   includes steps that establish the proper inference space, identify soil
   functions, attributes, and indicators, combine indicator responses in a
   soil quality model, establish baseline conditions for comparing soil
   change, validate relationships between indicators and soil productivity,
   and implement a sampling scheme to measure indicators, analyze trends,
   and interpret change for adapting Sustainable Forestry Practises (SFPs)
   to maximize their effectiveness. This monitoring process is proposed as
   a method for SFP research and development that will lead to sustainable

Abstract = {{Maintenance and enhancement of soil productivity is central to the
   long-term success of intensive forest management. A simple technique is
   required for monitoring the effects of different management practices on
   soils as an aid in developing codes of practice that foster maintenance
   and enhancement of soil productivity. The objective of our work was to
   determine if management impacts on soil productivity could be assessed
   using the soil-quality concepts developed in agriculture. A soil-quality
   index (SQI) model, that measures the effects of management practices on
   five key growth-determining attributes of forest soils. namely (1)
   promote root growth, (2) store, supply and cycle nutrients, (3) accept,
   hold, and supply water, (4) promote gas exchange, and (5) promote
   biological activity, was developed and rested as part of a controlled
   study in intensively-managed pine plantations on the Lower Coastal Plain
   of South Carolina. Three 20-ha, 20-year-old loblolly pine plantations
   were harvested under wet and dry conditions to create a broad gradient
   in soil disturbance. Within each harvested plantation, a subset of 3-ha
   plots were site prepared by either bedding or mole-plowing plus bedding,
   then all sites were established as third-rotation pine plantations.
   Field data were collected spatially for soil bulk density, net N
   mineralization, water table depth, soil aeration, and soil moisture.
   Literature-based sufficiency values were determined for each property
   and substituted into the SQI model as surrogate indicators for the five
   key attributes, thus obtaining spatial SQI predictions within each
   harvesting and site preparation treatment. Our study results demonstrate
   how SQI monitoring could be used to identify the effects of management
   practices on soil productivity, which should aid in developing codes of
   practice as a component of achieving long-term sustainability in
   domesticated forests. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Decision aids are needed to identify management strategies for complex
   agricultural problems affecting numerous stakeholders, Our objective was
   to develop a bioeconomic decision aid examining poultry litter
   application to winter squash, Cucurbita maxima, on the basis of multiple
   goals: enhancing environmental and soil quality, maximizing waste
   recycling, and maximizing net revenues. Because farm-level decisions
   about waste management may conflict with community goals, the decision
   aid balances the preferences of squash growers, poultry producers, and
   community-level decision makers. The aid utilizes a simulation model
   that compares four litter management alternatives: (1) fresh poultry
   litter applied to meet crop nitrogen (N) needs; (2) fresh poultry litter
   applied to meet crop phosphorus (P) needs; (3) composted poultry litter
   to meet crop N needs; and (4) composted poultry litter to meet crop P
   needs. Output from biophysical submodels compares well to literature
   data. Sensitivity tests show strong correlation between nutrient
   accumulation in soil pools and estimates of potentially available
   nutrients in fresh and composted litter. The decision model outcome,
   when averaged across stakeholder groups, clearly favors composted litter
   applied to meet crop P needs. Decision aids can help various stakeholder
   groups see how their priorities interact as well as demonstrate the
   importance of long-term analysis to assess alternative management
   strategies. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{For most of a century, the wide spread practice of growing only one crop
   every other year in a tillage based wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow
   rotation has degraded soils and contributed to environmental problems in
   low-precipitation (<350 mm annual) dryland regions of the inland Pacific
   Northwest of the USA. Many growers in this 2-million-ha cropland area
   are increasing the intensity; of cropping with spring crops, but most
   use conventional tillage (CT) for seedbed preparation. The agronomic
   performance of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), sown into CT seedbeds
   with double-disk drills or into standing stubble with several types of
   no-fill (NT) drills (hoe, single disk, and notched coulter), was
   determined in two experiments ron ducted both in 1996 and 1997 where the
   previous crop was either winter wheat or spring barley. We measured
   stand establishment, seed-zone temperature, soil Hater, dry biomass
   accumulation, rhizoctonia root rot, surface residue retention. and grain
   yield components, Plant stand (r(2) = 0.60). dry biomass accumulation
   (r(2) = 0.63), and spike density (r(2) = 0.62) as single independent
   variables, and combined in a multiple regression model (R-2 = 0.81),
   Here strongly correlated (P < 0.001) to grain yield. Early-season
   seed-zone temperatures were cooler under NT, but seed-zone water was
   slightly higher with CT. Low spike density consistently occurred in a
   wide row spacing (406 mm) NT drill treatment, and the highest overall
   yields Here obtained with NT drills with rows spaced 255 mm or less,
   Rhizoctonia root rot was severe on seminal roots in ail treatments in
   three out of four trials, but did not appear to limit yields, possibly
   due to healthy crown roots and favorable growing conditions. No-till
   spring sowing into undisturbed standing stubble (2420-5230 kg ha(-1))
   can produce grain yields equal to or exceeding those under CT and ran
   provide environmental and potential soil quality benefits for
   low-precipitation dryland farming areas in the inland pacific Northwest.}},

Abstract = {{In Honduras, the economic and social effects of natural resource
   decline, poverty, and population pressure, all exacerbated now in the
   aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, are directly experienced at the household
   level. Recent research and policy work on gender and environment raise a
   number of interesting questions on how and why household labor responses
   to natural resource decline may be gender differentiated. This article
   presents results on the gender-disaggregated response to natural
   resource degradation. Specifically, we investigate whether women's and
   men's time allocated to corn production responds to changes in soil
   quality. We also address the issue of whether the gender division of
   labor is modified as households respond to soil degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Organic matter amendments to soil are usually thought to improve soil
   quality. increased soil organic matter can lead to increased
   concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Complexation of DOM
   with pesticides ran lead to increased aqueous phase concentration and
   therefore enhanced movement through the soil profile, Dissolved organic
   matter has been shown to form a stable complex with napropamide
   {[}2(alpha-naphthoxy)-N,N-diethyl propionamide] and facilitate its
   transport through soil columns. Equilibrium dialysis is a common method
   to determine napropamide DOM complexation. Napropamide was applied to a
   silt loam soil with (SS) and without (NoSS) sewage sludge application.
   Solutions from batch equilibrium experiments were analyzed using
   equilibrium dialysis with various molecular weight cutoffs to determine
   napropamide DOM complexation. A maximum of 16\% of solution phase
   napropamide was found to be associated with a DOM complex having a
   molecular weight >500 Daltons. The maximum complex size had a molecular
   weight <25 000 Daltons, More napropamide was complexed from the SS soil
   treatments than from the NoSS soil treatments. The presence of a drying
   event following napropamide application also was found to increase the
   amount of napropamide complexed in both the SS and NoSS soils. Results
   show that the amount and molecular weight of napropamide-DOM complexes
   is affected by organic matter type and application method.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of organic production practices on soil quality indicators,
   for selected farms in Nebraska and North Dakota, were evaluated to
   better understand their effects on soil quality and sustainability.
   Conventional production practices were the standard to which the effects
   of organic production were compared. Five organic and conventional
   farms, matched by soil type, were chosen for the study, Soil properties
   recognized as basic soil quality indicators were measured on each farm
   at depths of 0 to 7.6 and 0 to 30.5 cm, Averaged across locations, there
   was 22\% more organic C (12 571 kg ha-(1)) and 20\% more total N (970 kg
   ha(-1)) on organic farms than conventional farms in the surface 30.5 cm,
   At four of five locations, organic farms had soil pH closer to neutral,
   lower bulk density, and higher available-water holding capacity,
   microbial biomass C and N, and soil respiration as compared with
   conventional farms. Nutrient levels above crop needs were observed in
   both organic and conventional farms indicating the potential for
   negative environmental impacts. Despite this, organic farms often had
   more potentially mineralizable N (anaerobic incubation) relative to
   NO3-N in the surface 30.5 cm. For conditions of this study, the capacity
   of organic production practices to improve soil quality was mainly due
   to use of more diverse crop sequences, application of organic:
   amendments, and less frequent tillage.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon, as an active component of organic matter, has considerable
   effects on soil quality and productivity. The objective of this study
   was to examine the effect of climate change variables on soil organic C
   (C-T) quality in an agroecosystem. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and
   soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr] plants were grown in 3 m in diam,
   open-top field chambers and exposed to charcoal-filtered (CF) air at 350
   mu L CO2 L-1; CF air + 150 mu L CO2 L-1; nonfiltered (NF) air + 35 nL
   O-3 L-1; and NF air + 35 nL O-3 L-1 + 150 mu L CO2 L-1 at two soil
   moisture levels from 1994 to 1996. The 150 mu L CO2 L-1 addition was 18
   h d(-1) and the 35 nL O-3 L-l was 7 h d(-1) from April until late
   October. In response to treatments, the CT contents did not change
   significantly; however, particulate, oxidizable, dissolved, humic (C-HA)
   and fulvic (C-FA) acid, and carbohydrate C pools increased in soils
   under CO2 enrichment and well-watered conditions but decreased under O-3
   stress compared with soils under CF ambient air quality. Tropospheric
   CO2 enrichment and well-watered condition increased, and O-3, stress
   decreased the log optical density slope for both C-HA and C-FA fractions
   more than CF ambient air and restricted moisture treatment. Also, the
   E-465/E-665 ratios of both C-HA and C-FA fractions were higher for the
   CO2 enrichment and smaller for the O-3 stress compared With CF ambient
   air quality, Results suggest that tropospheric CO2 enrichment and
   well-watered conditions may favor an accumulation of low molecular
   weight and more aliphatic quality of C and O-3 stress favor high
   molecular weight and more aromatic quality of C.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the appropriateness of institutionalizing soil quality as a
   defined parameter in soil science. The soil management research of land
   grant universities and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the
   mission and goals of state, federal, and private conservation agencies
   stand to be significantly affected. We feel that a non-advocative
   examination of this concept could provide a positive contribution. The
   definition of soil quality has proven elusive and value laden. There is
   concern by some that the concept has developed arbitrary policy
   overtones. Our reservations stem from concerns regarding premature
   acceptance and institutionalization of an incompletely formulated and
   largely untested paradigm, potential unintended negative outcomes,
   promotion of a narrowly defined environmental policy in a context
   normally associated with value-neutral science, and taxonomic and/or
   regional bias in establishing the paradigm, To date, soil quality
   assessments have drawn from a relatively narrow crop production and
   ecological perspective to positively or negatively weight soil quality
   assessment factors, Although the soil quality paradigm acknowledges
   multi-defined soil functions, it has yet to operationally recognize and
   integrate the simultaneity of diverse and often conflicting functions
   and soil property requirements. Thus, we are attempting to articulate
   the concerns of many of our colleagues who are reluctant to endorse
   redefining :the soil science paradigm away from the value-neutral
   tradition of edaphology and specific problem solving to a paradigm based
   on variable, and often subjective societal perceptions of environmental
   holism, Traditionally, it has been the soil science profession's role to
   perform the science to enable resource management policy and problem
   solving, not to establish relational-based value systems within the
   science. We suggest emphasizing quality soil management rather than soil
   quality management as a professional and scientific goal.}},

Abstract = {{Soils play a key role in the global carbon cycle. They can be a source
   or a sink of carbon and influence CO(2) concentrations in the
   atmosphere. In order to calculate the carbon budget of a region, the
   effect of soil management practices on carbon sequestration in soils
   needs to be quantified. Objectives of this experiment were to determine:
   (1) the effects of ridge till, plow till and no-till on the soil organic
   carbon (SOC) pool; (ii) the SOC loss or sequestration for mulch rates of
   0-16 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw applied in
   combination with each tillage method, and (iii) impacts of tillage and
   crop residue treatments on soil physical quality, including aggregation
   and porosity. The experiment was initiated in 1989 on a Crosby silt loam
   (Stagnic Luvisol) in Central Ohio. Seven years after initiation of the
   experiment, there was a positive, linear effect of residue application
   rate on SOC contents in all tillage treatments. In the eighth year of
   the experiment these trends were confirmed for plow and no-till, but not
   for ridge till. Linear-regression equations, relating SOC content for
   the 0-10 cm soil depth to mulch rate, were: for no-till: SOC (Mg ha(-1))
   = 15.21 + 0.32 {[}Residue (Mg ha(-1) year(-1))] (r = 0.68) and for plow
   till: SOC = 11.95 + 0.27 {[}Residue] (p = 0.72). The carbon conversion
   efficiencies were 8\% per year for plow till and 10\% per year for
   no-till. Detailed sampling at different depths revealed that increases
   in SOC content were only significant for the 0-5 cm depths of plow and
   no-till treatments. Effects of crop residue application on water stable
   aggregation in the 0-10 cm layer were most pronounced with plow till and
   ridge till but not with no-till. Water retention characteristics, a
   measure of pore size distribution, was not influenced by tillage system,
   but crop residue application had a significant effect on water retention
   in the 0-10 cm layer at matric suctions of 30-300 kPa. This means that
   residue application increased macropores of diameters 1-10 mu m. It is
   concluded that, depending on the amount of crop residue returned to the
   soil, the large numbers of farmers converting from plow to no-till
   cultivation in the Corn Belt may create an important sink for
   atmospheric CO(2). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation tillage may concentrate organic matter and carbon in the
   soil, thus improving soil quality and counteracting CO2-increase in the
   atmosphere. In parts of Germany however, continuous conservation tillage
   can cause problems in soil and crop management, resulting in a need to
   shift to short-term conventional tillage, such as mouldboard ploughing.
   The objective of the present research was to follow the fate of soil
   organic matter, when soil is ploughed after long-term minimum tillage in
   the temperate climate of Lower Saxony. In minimum tillage, shallow
   cultivation was restricted to stubble cleaning and seedbed preparation,
   using a rotary harrow or rototiller. After 20 years of shallow
   cultivation, soil organic carbon, soil nitrogen and microbial biomass
   carbon were concentrated in the top 5 cm of a loess-derived silt loam
   (Orthic Luvisol). In the 50 cm soil profile, mass of soil organic carbon
   tended to be higher by about 5 Mg ha(-1) as compared to conventionally
   ploughed soil, which contained roughly 65 Mg ha(-1). In the ploughed
   soil, soil nitrogen amounted to about 6.8 Mg ha(-1), whereas in the
   minimum tilled soil it was roughly 1.0 Mg ha(-1) higher. Total microbial
   biomass carbon fluctuated between 800 and 1300 kg ha(-1), the
   differences between tillage systems being less distinct. Ploughing the
   old minimum tilled land destroyed the stratification of soil organic
   matter. Moreover, during the winter months (November-March) the surplus
   of soil organic carbon and nitrogen masses, enriched by conservation
   tillage, was completely decomposed, presumably a consequence of its
   labile quality. Inverting the minimum tilled soil did not increase
   concentrations of organic carbon and nitrogen in the lower part of the
   A(p)-horizon, but it did increase concentration of microbial biomass
   carbon. We conclude that organic matter stratification and accumulation
   as a result of long-term minimum tillage were completely lost by a
   single application of inversion tillage in the course of a relatively
   mild winter. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations were conducted to evaluate the effects of long-term (up
   to 100 years) wastewater irrigation on the selected microbiological and
   biochemical characteristics of a Cambisol and a Haplic Luvisol. The
   developments of soil oligotrophic and copiotrophic bacteria (including
   actinomycetes), the total microbial biomass (ATP content), and acitivity
   of enzymes catalyzing major substrate transformations in soil
   (beta-glucosidase, beta-acetyl-glucosaminidase, proteinase, phosphatase)
   indicated significantly differences between wastewater treated and
   non-irrigated soil sites. The increases of the individual indices under
   the effect of wastewater irrigation show that remarkable differences in
   the microbiological and biochemical parameters of soil quality remained
   detectable also 20 years after the soil treatment was terminated.}},

Abstract = {{A priority for research is the quantification of the productive
   capability of soils on hillslopes. Data on soil biophysical changes and
   their impact on erosion are limited, especially on aspects which
   represent the farmers' perspective. The terms soil quality and soil
   productivity are defined and presented conceptually in models to
   identify information needs and to examine the biophysical and farming
   system components that are important to smallholders. Of the principal
   processes in declining soil productivity, reduction in soil depth and
   increasing difficulty of gaining production are most often identified by
   farmers. Using examples from Sri Lanka, field techniques of biophysical
   assessment of erosion, conservation, and their impacts are presented,
   with a focus on Gliricidia contour hedgerows. Techniques, such as
   measuring the armor layer of small stones, soil pedestals, and
   sedimentation in drains, are useful to assess erosion rates. Impacts can
   be identified by soil depth as a measure of historical erosion,
   differential growth of crops, and farmers' assessments of yields.
   Farmers' observations on the practices that they employ are essential in
   making realistic assessments of conservation measures for promotion.
   Field-based techniques are easy to use, rapid to undertake, and best
   represent the farmer-perspective.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes soil-related agronomic constraints in the Sitiung
   region of Indonesia that are directly related to low nutrient-holding
   capacity, macroporosity, and rainfall regime. This region receives 2500
   to 3000 mm of rainfall per year; but nearly 50\% of the rainfall is
   disposed of rapidly via internal drainage. Although rapid internal
   drainage reduces the risks of erosion, it leads to infertility, acidity,
   and Al toxicity. The physical structure of the soils is: characterized
   by stable aggregates, with numerous macropores in the surface and a
   predominantly microporous subsoil matrix interspersed with a few larger
   macropores. Macropores account for about 29\% of porosity in the surface
   and between 3 and 6\% in the subsoil. The saturated hydraulic
   conductivity of the matrix containing macropores averages about 300 to
   400 cm/day, whereas that of the microporous matrix is generally <1
   cm/day. The structure facilitates rapid infiltration and leaching of
   rainfall. However, little opportunity exists for nutrients moving
   downward with drainage water to accumulate in the subsoil. The main
   reason for this seems to be the low hydraulic conductivity and the,
   preponderance of excessive wetness in the subsoil, Drying seems to be
   essential for movement of nutrients into the subsoil matrix, However,
   most of the agronomic crops are sensitive to Al toxicity and fail to
   grow roots deeper than: 10 to 15 crh. Thus, they suffer from water
   stress, despite heavy and frequent rainfall, and fail to cause drying of
   the subsoil, Problems of acidity; AZ toxicity, and infertility worsen
   progressively where agricultural production consists mainly of
   Al-sensitive crops. Although liming with calcium carbonate improves the
   soil chemical environment, downward movement of lime is very slow. Deep:
   liming is effective in improving rooting depth, crop water availability,
   and drying of the subsoil, but the technology is cost- and
   labor-intensive. Native vegetation, on the other hand, is able: to:grow
   roots to considerable depths and causes significant drying of the
   subsoil, even without soil amendments. Thus, production systems: in
   which locally adapted vegetation of economic value is the-main focus:
   seem to be more sustainable and conducive to improving soil conditions.}},

   still represents a serious challenge to the environmental scientists and
   engineers. Statistical and spatial analysis tools have been used
   successfully to assess the volume and spread of soil contamination. The
   techniques suggested so far require good historical record of the study
   area in addition to the large amounts of soil quality data that need to
   be collected. Furthermore, they are only able to identify/provide a
   qualitative description of the pollution sources and do not guaranty
   convincing results in cases of complex or poorly recorded contamination.
   Research described in this paper has developed a methodology that
   combines statistical and geostatistical analysis tools with geographic
   information systems for the quantitative and spatial assessment of
   contamination sources.
   In a previous paper, principal component and factor analysis tools where
   shown to successfully explore the physical processes behind pollution.
   This information is proven invaluable in the design of canonical
   correlation analysis for the soil contamination data, so that
   distinctive pollution sources are separated quantitatively. The
   geostatistical analysis tools in conjunction with geographic information
   systems address the spatial dimension of the data and the pollution
   sources. The practical aspects of the methodology are illustrated using
   soil contamination data from Lavrio old mine site in Greece.}},

Abstract = {{Selected in-field physical, chemical and biological indicators were
   measured for the rapid assessment of soil quality changes in a Sorrento
   silty clay loam as a result of compost and ammonium nitrate application
   to a broccoli field (San Benito County, CA). Plots were laid out in a
   randomized complete block design with four replications of 0, 22 and 44
   Mg ha(-1) compost treatments which were split to include fertilizer (165
   kg N ha(-1)) and no-fertilizer subplots. Soil samples were taken on 11
   and 24 October 1995 during the active growth phase of the crop, and soil
   quality evaluation was compared to crop nutrient content and yield which
   were determined at harvest in November.
   Surface application of ammonium nitrate initially stimulated soil
   nitrification and acidification processes in the top 7.6 cm as evidenced
   by an 80-fold increase in nitrate-N and accumulation of nitrite, a
   1.5-unit increase in electrical conductivity (EC) and a 1,4-unit
   decrease in pH. Following irrigation, this pattern was reversed by
   nitrate leaching and root uptake, although nitrification and
   acidification effects remained detectable at both sampling depths (0-7.6
   and 0-20 cm), Nitrification was positively correlated to soil
   respiration and negatively correlated to soil water content. The
   estimated nitrate-N levels of fertilizer-containing plots in the top 20
   cm were two times higher than those reported in the literature as
   minimal levels for optimal corn growth and indicated a high risk for
   groundwater contamination in this irrigated field by taking into account
   the rapid water infiltration and low soil buffering capacity.
   The detected short-term beneficial effects of compost application were
   the stabilization of pH and the decrease of water infiltration rate.
   stabilization of pH prevented acidification effects due to fertilizer
   application at both sampling depths. The high soil EC of plots receiving
   44 Mg ha(-1) of compost at the 0-20 cm depth probably resulted from a
   high compost salt content, other than nitrates, and warns against
   repeated use of high EC composts that may result in N depletion, reduced
   nutrient cycling and impaired crop growth.
   The relatively small differences among treatments in crop yield, head
   number and weight, leaf and petiole nutrients indicated that there was
   sufficient residual fertility to grow a crop in the absence of any
   amendments. However, the relevance of selected soil quality indicators
   to plant productivity and health was evidenced by the strong correlation
   of soil nitrate-N with leaf-N and head weight, despite the adequate-
   to-excessive amount of soil nitrate-N in most treatments. (C) 1999

Journal = {{APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{263-272}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Soil quality changes resulting from repeated or single injection of
   liquid municipal sewage sludge were evaluated in terraced cropland in
   eastern Nebraska, USA. Differences in soil properties among sampling
   locations were explained primarily by two factors, landscape position
   and sludge injection. Selected chemical properties (pH, EC, NO3-N) did
   not generally differ between landscape positions, but soil organic
   matter (organic C and N) and microbial activity indices (soil
   respiration, biomass N, available N, mineralization and nitrification
   rates) were more sensitive indicators of change. Values of these
   indicators generally increased down-slope from the upper terrace to the
   grassed waterway on a west facing slope. A probable similar pattern on
   the east slope was obscured by repeated application of sludge. Single or
   repeated (long-term) sludge injection increased the readily decomposable
   organic matter, ammonium- and available-N in soil (0-30.5 cm depth).
   These changes stimulated soil microbial activity as evidenced by
   increased basal respiration, net mineralization and nitrification rates,
   Consequently, nitrification of ammonium-N was reflected in soil chemical
   properties as increased soil nitrate-N (to levels that were more than
   two times higher than sufficiency levels for corn) and EC and by
   decreased pH. In-field measurements detected changes in physical
   properties such as a decrease of infiltration rate caused by sludge
   injection and soil compaction as a result of traffic operations.
   Differences between the sites of single and repeated sludge injection
   were found in soil pH. ammonoim-N, organic matter and microbial
   activity. Recent sludge injection resulted in higher ammonium-N
   concentration and higher microbial activity in soil, and repeated sludge
   injection resulted in lower pH and in greater organic matter content.
   Regardless of these differences in soil properties between the sites of
   single and repeated sludge application, the overall changes that were
   caused by sludge injection had both positive and negative effects on
   soil quality and the sustainability of this management practice.
   Increase of organic matter content and biological activity improved soil
   fertility, but excessive amounts of ammonium salts contained in liquid
   sludge resulted in soil nitrification, excessive nitrate formation and
   acidification. These processes reduce soil productivity, increase the
   risk of ground- and surface-water contamination and pose a threat to
   plant and animal health. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A critical review of biological parameters used to indicate pollutant
   impact on soil quality was conducted. These parameters mention some soil
   invertebrates. The value of an indicative organism depends on its life
   expectancy, life style and specific importance. Nematodes, mites,
   collembolans, enchytraeids, earthworms, isopods and molluscs are good
   potential biological indicators. Biological indicators of
   bioaccumulation and biological indicators of effects (toxicological and
   ecological) can bq distinguished. Bioaccumulation studies are difficult
   to interpret, as wide variations could be found, depending on taxonomic
   group, habitat, organ studied, soil type or even pollutant type. Some
   groups, such as Collembola, require in depth bioaccumulation studies. It
   is suggested to use a pool of macro-concentrators, including at least
   some earthworm, isopod and gastropod species. Toxicological indicators
   have been well studied and their lethal and sublethal pollutant effects
   are well known. However, studies have focused on only a few species,
   such as the earthworm Eisenia foetida or the collembolan Folsomia
   candida. These studies should be extended to other zoological groups, as
   well as to several species from the same group, to generate a
   representative test battery. Exposure biomarkers and physiological
   change studies should be emphasised, as they act as very early warning
   systems of contamination. Data are currently lacking on how soil
   biological processes malfunction due to pollution. We need to explore
   the links between pollutant effects on soil fauna and pollutant effects
   on soil functioning. Concerning ecological indicators, studies should
   develop sampling techniques and parameters, which are specific to
   ecotoxicological goals. Before-after impact control procedures should be
   carried out, to eliminate the background noise of the study site and
   only evaluate the influence of pollutants. On the other hand, ecological
   indices, such as taxonomic diversity or richness, should be used
   carefully especially concerning chronic pollution. Effects of pollutants
   on biological cycle studies seem very promising, but need further
   information on the life history strategies of many species. Furthermore,
   the pollutant tolerance of rare species should be considered. The
   different types of biological indicators yield complementary information
   on pollutant effects. They all need standard procedures. In this
   context, studies should be extended and diversified, and associate
   bioaccumulation, toxicological and ecological indicators to provide
   better information on soil quality. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a multi-scale investigation of the
   social and biophysical dimensions of land degradation in three villages
   in southwestern Burkina Faso. In this region, technological change in
   the form of animal traction and cotton has combined with massive
   migration to create pressure on natural resources. These pressures have,
   in turn, increased farmed areas and decreased fallow periods. Whether
   this has resulted in widespread land degradation, however, depends on
   the scale of analysis. At the broad scale, aerial photos confirm
   farmers' perceptions that their land resource is degraded, showing
   decreases in forested land, increases in area under cultivation, and
   increases in areas characterized as degraded. At the field scale, an
   analysis of soil samples collected from these farmers' fields in 1988
   and again in 1996 indicates that there has not been a widespread
   reduction of soil quality. Soils under continuous cultivation revealed
   few changes, while soils that were fallowed during the eight-year period
   showed improvement in nutrient status. A study of agricultural practices
   illustrates how some farmers are responding to the lack of fallow land
   by intensifying their production system. They nurture trees on
   agricultural fields, use more inputs and construct anti-erosion barriers
   on sloped fields to prevent erosion.
   Changes apparent on one scale are therefore met with responses which are
   apparent at other scales. The paper illustrates the importance of farmer
   perceptions, access to resources and local social structures in

Abstract = {{No-till (NT) increases the potential to crop more frequently in the
   Great Plains than with the conventional-till (CT) crop-fallow farming sl
   stem. More frequent cropping requires N input to maintain economical
   yields. We evaluated the effects of N Fertilization on crop residue
   production and its subsequent effects on soil organic C (SOC) and total
   soil N (TSN) in a dryland NT annual cropping system. Six N rates (0, 22,
   45, 67, 90, and 134 kg N ha(-1)) were applied to the same plots from
   1984 through 1994, except 1988 when rates sere reduced 50\%, on a Weld
   silt loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argiustoll). Spring hal leg
   (Hordeum vulgare L.), corn (Zea mays L.),winter wheat (Triticum aestivum
   L.), and oat (Avena sativa L.)-pea (Lathyrus tingitanus L.) hay were
   grown in rotation. Crop residue production varied with crop and gear.
   Estimated average annual aboveground residue returned to the soil
   (excluding hay years) was 2925, 3845, 4354, 4365, 4371, and 4615 kg
   ha(-1), while estimated annual contributions to belowground (root)
   residue C were 1060, 1397, 1729, 1992, 1952, and 2031 kg C ha(-1) for
   the above N rates, respectively. The increased amount of crop residue
   returned to the soil with increasing N rate resulted in increased SOC
   and TSN levels in the 0- to 7.5-cm soil depth after 11 crops. The
   fraction of applied N fertilizer in the crop residue decreased with
   increasing N rate. Soil bulk density (D-b) in the 0- to 7.5-cm soil
   depth decreased as SOC increased, The increase in SOC with N
   fertilization contributes to improved soil quality and productivity, and
   increased efficiency of C sequestration into the soil. Carbon
   sequestration can be enhanced by increasing crop residue production
   through adequate N fertility.}},

Abstract = {{Successful soil quality assessment strategies are needed to improve our
   ability to manage soils sustainably. Our objective was to use a
   multivariate data set to determine whether recent adoption of no-tillage
   (NT) practices had altered soil quality in Illinois. In 1995 and 1996,
   we sampled thirty-six farm fields under conventional tillage (CT) or NT
   practices and relatively nondisturbed (ND) areas. Soils were Mollisols
   or Alfisols. Tillage or region affected 20 of the 23 parameters
   characterized, Soil chemical parameters were less variable than
   biological or physical measures. Principal component analysis (PCA) was
   used to assess soil quality overall, Principal component 1 (PCI) stores,
   which explained 39\% of the total variance of the overall data set, were
   affected by tillage (ND > NT > CT) and increased,vith particulate and
   organic C and total N, biological activity, mineralizable N, and wet
   aggregate stability, and decreased with bulk density and dry aggregate
   mean weight diameter. The only significant factor contributing to PC2
   was penetration resistance: PC2 explained 13\% of the variance and
   decreased as follows: NT greater than or equal to ND > CT. Multivariate
   assessment of soil quality indicated use of NT practices improved the
   biological and physical condition of the soil (0-15 cm) despite
   increased consolidation. It also showed that those biological and
   physical aspects of soils influenced by organic matter were the
   properties most altered by agronomic practices, Particulate organic
   matter (POM) was identified as a promising soil quality measure. A nest
   step is to determine the biological and environmental relevance of a
   refined set of soil quality measures in conjunction with soil processes
   of regional concern.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion of pasture land to crop rotation by plow tillage and
   reversion to pasture for replenishment of nutrients is a common practice
   in New Zealand. It is known that plow tillage decreases soil organic
   matter and causes biological degradation. The objective of this study
   was to investigate the effects of tillage practices on soil microbial
   biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), microbial
   biomass phosphorus (MBP), and earthworm (Aporrectodea caliginosa)
   populations used as indicators of soil biological status and of
   sustainability of permanent pasture (PP) to crop rotation using
   different tillage practices. The experimental site at Massey University
   (Turitea Campus) was established in 1995, where PP land was converted to
   double crop rotation using plow tillage (PT) and no-tillage (NT), Crops
   were summer fodder maize (Zea mays L.) and winter oat (Avena sativa L.);
   and PP was used as a control. Plant establishment and crop yields were
   similar in NT and PT, although adoption of NT reduced weed growth.
   Microbial biomass contents in PP and NT treatments were almost twice as
   much in 0-5 cm depth soil as in 5-10 cm depth soil. No quantitative
   differences occurred between 0-5 and 5-10 cm depths in the PT treatment.
   Conversion of PP to PT cropping resulted in a 45\% decline in MBC, 53\%
   in MBN and 51\% in MBP in the 0-5 cm soil layer. Microbial biomass
   content ratios in the 5-10 cm layer did not differ significantly among
   the tillage practices and cropping regimes. At 0-10 cm depth,
   concentrations of MBC, MBN and MBP were significantly higher in the PP
   and NT than in the PT treatment. MBC and MBN levels in autumn were
   significantly higher than in summer and winter. Earthworm populations
   and live mass were also significantly higher in the PP and NT than in
   the PT treatment. It was concluded that adoption of NT can protect soils
   from biological degradation and maintain soil quality as compared with
   PT management. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical and biochemical qualities of three soils under different
   uses, native, intermittently cultivated (set-aside) and intensively
   cultivated, were studied. The soils were sampled in two Mediterranean
   ecosystems comprising the humid-temperate climate of Central-West Italy
   and the semi-arid zone of Central-West Spain. Pyrolysis-gas
   chromatography and specific enzyme tests related to C, N, P, cycles
   (urease, phosphatase, proteases, beta-glucosidase) were used to compare
   the degree of humification and biochemical activity of humus-enzyme
   complexes. Pyrolitic data indicated a high degree of humification of
   organic matter in native and intensively cultivated soils. Going from
   native to set-aside to intensively cultivated soils, the
   sodium-pyrophosphate extracted humic substances and the absolute
   enzymatic activity decreased, while the specific enzyme activities
   (activity per unit of extracted carbon) showed similar values in the
   three soil types. Even in conditions where most of the labile soil
   organic matter was lost as a consequence of intermittent or intense
   cultivation, the intensively cultivated soils were able to preserve a
   humic-enzyme pool with a comparable level of biochemical energy,
   although total organic carbon decreased by 86\%. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Diameter increments for individual trees increased curvilinearly and
   stand basal area increments decreased curvilinearly as spacing increased
   from 6.6 to 26.4 feet. Average height growth of all trees increased
   linearly, and stand cubic volume growth decreased linearly as spacing
   increased. Large differences in tree sizes developed over the 35 years
   of study with various spacing treatments. Plots without understory grew
   more during the first 20 years of study but soil quality decreased.
   During the last 15 years, growth rates on plots without understory were
   not superior to plots with understory when adjusted to common basal
   areas and volumes. Growth rates for the largest trees on the plots were
   decreased by competition from smaller trees. After 35 years, total cubic
   volume yield decreased linearly as spacing increased but Scribner
   board-foot yields increased curvilinearly as spacing increased, and
   spacings of 13.2, 18.7, and 26.4 feet produced about the same board-foot
   yield. Live crown ratios increased with increasing spacing, primarily
   because of increased height growth. Twenty years after thinning, crown
   width increased curvilinearly as spacing increased and was greater in
   the absence of understory. Crown cover appeared to be linearly related
   to stand density index. Mortality was so low that there was no practical
   difference in net and gross 35-year mean annual growth of cubic volume
   and basal area. Spacing for precommercial thinnings on similar sites
   should be at least 14 feet and much higher spacings could be warranted
   if managers wish to grow stands of large-diameter trees with low
   mortality from bark beetles.}},

Abstract = {{Short-rotation tree forests are irrigated with landfill leachate to
   reduce both leachate volume and nutrient content. It is of interest both
   for leachate treatment and energy recovery to optimise the productivity
   of such plantations. This study's aim was to investigate the effects of
   irrigation on soil quality, tree growth and on emissions of landfill gas
   (LFG) produced in the wastes.
   Soils irrigated with leachate had a higher average nutrient and organic
   matter contents, and a lower dry solids content. Larger trees occur on
   plots irrigated with leachate, presumably due to the positive effect of
   water and nutrient supply. The willows used in this experiment seemed to
   be tolerant of high carbon dioxide concentrations, as no statistically
   effect arising from LFG emissions could be linked to tree growth.
   Methane oxidation levels between 50 and 950 mol m(-2) yr(-1) were
   observed. The positive correlation between soil methane oxidation
   capacity and tree presence is an interesting perspective on reduction of
   methane emissions by landfill's top cover vegetation type. Optimising
   methane oxidation using vegetation as a `cover crop' could reduce the
   amount of methane discharged into the atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Earthworms, which inhabit soils and litter layers in most landscapes,
   can offer an important tool to evaluate different environmental
   transformations and impacts. Agricultural landscapes, urban and
   industrialized habitats have some earthworms that represent interesting
   indicators to monitor different contaminations, to assess different
   farming practices and different landscape structures and
   transformations. Species number, abundance and biomass can give easily
   measurable elements. Ecological guilds can help in comparing different
   environments.
   Taxonomy is relatively well known, at least in temperate areas, when
   species identification is in general easily solved. CD-ROM based
   programs facilitate rapid identification of collected specimens.
   The substantial amount of research carried out on these invertebrates
   has made these soil organisms more promising for further improved and
   accurate work in assessing sustainability of different environments. In
   most cases earthworm biomass or abundance can offer a valuable tool to
   assess different environmental impacts such as tillage operations, soil
   pollution, different agricultural input, trampling, industrial plant
   pollution, etc. In rural environments different farming systems can be
   assessed using earthworm biomass and numbers. (C)1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Farmers are being encouraged to redress the problems of land degradation
   by implementing a series of changes in their land management. However,
   there are few tools to monitor soil condition which can reliably inform
   farmers of the state of their soil. This paper examines ants and their
   importance in ecosystem functioning, principally their ability to
   maintain or restore soil quality in rural environments, and their value
   as bioindicators of soil quality. The reader is provided with a summary
   of those studies which have recorded the species composition and
   activity of ant fauna in agricultural soils and naturally vegetated
   environments. However, it is rare to find studies which sample both
   environments concurrently. An overview of the types of measures
   available to assess ant biodiversity is followed by a discussion of the
   current status of biopedological research into ant-soil relationships
   and the trends and gaps in current research knowledge, principally in
   the areas of water and soil movement and nutrient effects. Lastly the
   paper seeks to forecast the future directions of ant biopedological
   research, and to identify the type of research required to fully
   appreciate the value of ants as soil quality indicators to monitor the
   sustainability of the soil resource. Ants should be considered an
   important group of soil fauna, yet they have received meagre attention
   in comparison with other soil fauna such as earthworms. There is a need
   for specific experiments to test the hypothesis that ants can be used as
   bioindicators of soil quality. (C)1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of fresh and composted urban wastes on the organic matter of
   an arid soil were evaluated. The quality of the arid soil was improved
   with organic amendment. This improvement was more evident in soils
   amended with fresh residues (municipal solid waste and sewage sludge)
   than in those with compost. The latter, though having a less spectacular
   action, showed higher amounts of humic substances and fulvic and humic
   acids at the end of the incubation. The different carbon fractions of
   the soil amended with fresh residues showed significantly higher

Abstract = {{The suitability of a new method to determine the minimum number of data
   required to stabilize a calculation is studied. Five different
   calculations have been computed, changing the order of data randomly.
   The statistical reliability of numerical values has also been calculated
   depending on the successive increase in the number of data included. In
   our study, when few data are considered, a great variation in the
   estimations is observed depending on the individual data included. The
   calculation is stabilized for a sample size between 5 and 15 data
   points, and the sample can therefore be considered representative
   enough. Results are in agreement with those presented by other authors.}},

Abstract = {{Interpretation of nematode community indices requires a reference to a
   relatively undisturbed community. Maturity and trophic diversity index
   values were compared for five pairs of certified organically and
   conventionally managed soils in the Piedmont region of North Carolina.
   Available nitrogen (nitrate, ammonium) was estimated at various lag
   periods relative to times of sampling for nematode communities to
   determine the strength of correlative relationship between nematode
   communities and nitrogen availability. Soils were sampled six times
   yearly in 1993 and 1994 to determine the best time of year to sample.
   Maturity values for plant parasites were greater in organically than
   conventionally managed soils, and differences between management systems
   were greater in fall than spring months. However, other maturity and
   diversity indices did not differ between the two management practices.
   Differences in crop species grown in the two systems accounted for most
   differences observed in the community of plant-parasitic nematodes.
   Indices of free-living nematodes were correlated negatively with
   concentrations of ammonium, whereas indices of plant-parasitic nematodes
   were correlated positively with concentrations of nitrate. Due to the
   similarity of index values between the two systems, organically managed
   soils are not suitable reference sites for monitoring and assessing the
   biological aspects of soil quality for annually harvested crops.}},

   applications of sludges on agricultural crops and soil quality have
   demonstrated yield increases from two-to-five-fold greater than control.
   These trials have also shown that increased yields have been sustained
   for at least five growing seasons. Experiments established in the forest
   have demonstrated height and diameter increases up to 2.5-fold for white
   spruce (Picea glauca) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia)
   seedlings planted in the sludge-amended plots compared to the control
   plots.}},

Abstract = {{Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), and maize (Zea
   mays L.) provide about two-thirds of all energy in human diets, and four
   major cropping systems in which these cereals are grown represent the
   foundation of human food supply. Yield per unit time and land has
   increased markedly during the past 30 years in these systems, a result
   of intensified crop management involving improved germ-plasm, greater
   inputs of fertilizer, production of two or more crops per year on the
   same piece of land, and irrigation, Meeting future food demand while
   minimizing expansion of cultivated area primarily will depend on
   continued intensification of these same four systems. The manner in
   which further intensification is achieved, however, will differ markedly
   from the past because the exploitable gap between average farm yields
   and genetic yield potential is closing. At present, the rate of increase
   in yield potential is much less than the expected increase in demand.
   Hence, average farm yields must reach 70-80\% of the yield potential
   ceiling within 30 years in each of these major cereal systems. Achieving
   consistent production at these high levels without causing environmental
   damage requires improvements in soil quality and precise management of
   all production factors in time and space. The scope of the scientific
   challenge related to these objectives is discussed. It is concluded that
   major scientific breakthroughs must occur in basic plant physiology,
   ecophysiology, agroecology, and soil science to achieve the ecological
   intensification that is needed to meet the expected increase in food
   demand.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon (SOC) was partitioned between unprotected and
   protected pools in six forests along an elevation gradient in the
   southern Appalachian Mountains using two physical methods: flotation in
   aqueous CaCl2 (1.4 g/mL) and wet sieving through a 0.053 mm sieve. Both
   methods produced results that were qualitatively and quantitatively
   similar. Along the elevation gradient, 28 to 53\% of the SOC was
   associated with an unprotected pool that included forest floor O-layers
   and other labile soil organic matter (SOM) in various stages of
   decomposition. Most (71 to 83\%) of the C in the mineral soil at the six
   forest sites was identified as protected because of its association with
   a heavy soil fraction (> 1.4 g/mL) or a silt-clay soil fraction. Total
   inventories of SOC in the forests (to a depth of 30 cm) ranged from 384
   to 1244 mg C/cm(2). The turnover time of the unprotected SOC was
   negatively correlated (r = -0.95, p < 0.05) with mean annual air
   temperature (MAT) across the elevation gradient. Measured SOC
   inventories, annual C returns to the forest floor, and estimates of C
   turnover associated with the protected soil pool were used to
   parameterize a simple model of SOC dynamics. Steady-state predictions
   with the model indicated that, with no change in C inputs, the low-
   (235-335 m), mid- (940-1000 m), and high- (1650-1670 m) elevation
   forests under study might surrender approximate to 40 to 45\% of their
   current SOC inventory following a 4 degrees C increase in MAT.
   Substantial losses of unprotected SOM as a result of a warmer climate
   could have long term impacts on hydrology, soil quality, and plant
   nutrition in forest ecosystems throughout the southern Appalachian
   Mountains.}},

Abstract = {{Fertilizers are frequently used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and
   quality. Increasingly, microbial and enzyme inhibitors are being used to
   enhance the efficiency of fertilizer nitrogen use. The assumption being
   made is that the impact of these compounds is short-term or localized
   and thus does not adversely impact soil quality. This study investigates
   the implications of urea fertilizer with and without urease inhibitor
   {[}N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide, NBPT], conventional and zero
   tillage systems,and soil types on the soil biological characteristics
   including N mineralization. Microplot studies were conducted in clay
   loam and fine sandy loam soils in Manitoba. Soil type had a significant
   effect on the soil organic C but tillage did not have any significant
   effect. Soil microbial biomass C content ranged widely (131-1215 mu g
   g(-1) soil). The clay loam soil generally tended to contain higher
   biomass C than the sandy loam soil. The potential soil mineral N
   production (N-0) was higher in clay loam soil (92.6 mu g g(-1) soil)
   than sandy loam soil (40.2 mu g g(-1) soil). Tillage systems, urea and
   urease inhibitor application had no significant impact on the soil
   biomass C, N-0, arylsulfatase or acid and alkaline phosphatase content.
   At these sites considerable fluctuations occurred in the microbial and
   biochemical properties due to the variation of soil type. In general,
   these fluctuations were mainly related to soil organic matter and soil
   moisture content. Tillage system, urea with and without NBPT application
   did not contribute any notable impact on the soil biological properties
   reported in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Cereal straw has many potential on-farm and off-farm uses, if straw is
   to be removed from land, the practice should not adversely impact
   long-term crop production and soil quality. A 10-yr experiment was
   conducted on a Dark Grey Solod near Beaverlodge, Alberta (55 degrees
   13'N, 119 degrees 20'W) to determine the effects of fertilizer and straw
   management on the yield of, and nutrient (N and P) use by, continuous
   barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Four straw management treatments: (i) straw
   removal; (ii) straw ploughed in; (iii) straw disked in; and (iv) straw
   disked in plus a red clover (Trifoleum pratense L.) green manure disked
   in every fifth year, were superimposed on four fertilizer treatments.
   The fertilizer treatments were application of N and P: (i) banded at
   soil-test recommended rates (ST,b); (ii) broadcast and incorporated at
   soil-test recommended rates (ST,bi); (iii) banded at soil-test rates of
   N+ 25 kg ha(-1) and P+ 10 kg ha(-1) (ST+,b); and (iv) as in (iii) but
   broadcast-applied and incorporated (ST+,bi). The straw ploughed-in
   treatment tended to produce lower annual barley yield and N uptake (by 9
   and 13\%, respectively) than the other three residue treatments. Barley
   yield and utilization of N and P were unaffected by straw removal as
   compared to disking-in straw. Barley yield and N uptake were higher (by
   12 and 17\%, respectively) with N and P application at the higher rate.
   At the recommended rate, broadcast-and-incorporated application of
   fertilizers resulted in lower yields and nutrient use than banded-in
   application. Treatment effects on P uptake tended to be small. The
   green-manured treatment used less fertilizer N, resulted in less total
   barley grain production, and did not increase the amount of crop
   residues incorporated. It is concluded that grain yield and nutrient (N
   and P) use of a continuous barley cropping system, fertilized at
   recommended rates of N and P, were unaffected by straw removal.}},

Abstract = {{Brine-affected land at oil exploration sites is a prime source of
   pollution to soil, plant, and aquatic communities. The two primary
   effects of brine on soil are (1) degradation of soil structure and (2)
   alteration of the osmotic gradient between plant roots and the soil.
   Runoff from the damaged land also degrades the quality of receiving
   streams. The objective of this study was to assess the extent of damage
   caused by brine on a productive land and two adjacent streams. Data on
   soil quality revealed that over time the combined effects of brine and
   erosion had left the land devoid of vegetation. Detailed soil analyses
   showed elevated levels of soluble salt, moderate pH (7.5), high clay
   content (>38\%), electrical conductivity values that ranged from 7 to 62
   dSm(-1), and very high exchangeable sodium percentage (70\%). The water
   quality of the two receiving streams was severely impacted by high salt
   and sediment loading. Based on soil and water quality data from the
   disturbed site, a strategy was developed to rehabilitate the land by a
   combination of engineering and agronomic practices. Six months after the
   rehabilitation, approximately 90\% of the land had been restored with
   full establishment of seeded Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon).}},

Abstract = {{This study sought to contribute to the understanding of soil
   redistribution by tillage on terraces and the extent and causes of
   within-field variation in soil properties by examining the spatial
   distributions of soil redistribution rates, derived using caesium-137,
   and of total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations, within a
   ribbon and a shoulder terrace in a yuan area of the Loess Plateau of
   China. Additional water erosion rate data were obtained for nine other
   terraces.
   Water erosion rates on the ribbon terraces were low (<1 kg m(-2)
   yr(-1)), unless slope tangents exceeded 0.1. However, despite the use of
   animal traction, high rates of tillage erosion were observed (mean 5.5
   kg m(-2) yr(-1)). Soil nitrogen concentrations were related to rates of
   soil redistribution by tillage on the ribbon terrace examined in detail.
   In general, higher rates of water erosion (0.5-2.9 kg m(-2) yr(-1)) and
   lower rates of tillage erosion (mean 1.4 kg m(-2) yr(-1)) were evident
   on the longer shoulder terraces. On the shoulder terrace examined in
   detail, soil phosphorus concentrations were related to net rates of soil
   redistribution.
   A statistically significant regression relationship between water
   erosion rates and the USLE length and slope factor was used in
   conjunction with the simulation of tillage erosion rates to evaluate a
   range of terrace designs. It is suggested that off-site impacts of
   erosion could be further reduced by ensuring that the slope tangents are
   kept below 0.06 and lengths below 30 m, especially on the shoulder
   terraces. Tillage erosion and the systematic redistribution of soil
   nutrients could be reduced by modification of the contour-cultivation
   technique to turn soil in opposing directions in alternate years.

Abstract = {{Sustainability of agricultural management systems has become an issue of
   wide public concern and international debate. One result is that soil
   quality assessment has been suggested as a tool for evaluating
   sustainability of soil and crop management practices. Our objective was
   to adapt a soil quality index to assess the effects of three long-term
   tillage systems on sloping Grantsburg silt loam soil. Soil quality was
   evaluated using a framework that included three soil functions: (1)
   resist erosion (water relations), (2) provide plant nutrients (nutrient
   relations), and (3) provide a favorable root environment (rooting
   relations). A score for each of these functions was computed using
   measurements (indicators) that were normalized with one of the three
   (more is better, optimum, or worse) scoring functions. Six different
   indices were developed from a basic framework. Modifications included
   changing the weighting factors, threshold limits, or type of scoring
   function applied to indicators, and the addition of air-filled and water
   storage porosity to the nutrient and rooting relations functions.
   Changing threshold limits and the type of scoring function used for
   surface residue improved the correlation between water relations and
   soil lass. The addition of porosity indicators increased the sensitivity
   of nutrient and rooting relations functions to yield and cone index,
   respectively, and resulted in a better correlation between porosity
   indicators and plant population. Computing soil quality indices helped
   to combine different soil properties and processes into a simple tool
   that explained changes in complex soil properties in response to
   different tillage practices. This supports previous studies suggesting
   that computing soil quality indices and functions could be useful for
   selecting management practices to maintain or improve soil quality. Our
   results demonstrated that adjusting threshold limits for local
   conditions can make the function ratings more or less sensitive to thr
   management practices being evaluated. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The effects of sowing lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) strips in irrigated
   cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fields on soil quality was evaluated in a
   Vertisol at the Australian Cotton Research Institute (ACRI), and in a
   Vertisol and an Alfisol at two on-farm sites in New South Wales,
   Australia, from December 1995 to February 1997. Chemical (pH, EC, CEC,
   exchangeable sodium percentage, organic C), physical (air-filled
   porosity, plastic limit, dispersion index, soil strength), and
   biological (earthworm activity) indicators of soil quality were measured
   in each site. Overall soil quality in cotton and lucerne strips was
   evaluated using a `soil health condition report card' format to award a
   score to each soil quality indicator and summing up the individual
   scores to give a single value for each crop at any one site. The
   decision to award a particular score to any one indicator was based on a
   value range derived from the Literature. In comparison with cotton,
   lucerne strips had higher air-filled porosity and organic C in the
   sub-soil of both on-farm sites, but had no significant effect at ACRI.
   However, lucerne did result in higher organic C in the soil surface at
   ACRI. Soil strength was higher and EC lower within lucerne strips in all
   three sites. Sowing lucerne strips resulted in higher earthworm activity
   at ACRI and at one commercial site, with highest numbers of earthworm
   burrows being observed in the former. We suggest that this has affected
   liquid flow patterns at ACRI where preferential flow mediated via the
   earthworm burrows appears to dominate. Overall soil quality was improved
   by lucerne strips only at ACRI, whereas that in the on-farm sites was
   not affected. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of tree leaf amendment and N fertilization on soil quality
   in turfgrass environments was evaluated. Our objective was to assess
   changes in soil quality after additions of leaf materials and N
   fertilization by monitoring soil chemical and physical parameters,
   microbial biomass and soil enzymes. Established perennial ryegrass
   (Lolium perenne) plots were amended annually with maple (Acer spp.)
   leaves at three different rates (0, 2240, and 4480 kg ha(-1) year(-1))
   and treated with three nitrogen rates (0, 63, and 126 kg N ha(-1)
   year(-1)). Tree leaf mulching did not significantly affect water
   infiltration or bulk density.:However, trends in the data suggest
   increased infiltration with increasing leaf application rate. Tree leaf
   mulching increased total soil C and N at 0-1.3 cm depth but not at
   1.3-9.0 cm. Extracted microbial phospholipid, an indicator of microbial
   biomass size, ranged from 28 to 68 nmol phospholipid g(-1) soil at the
   1.3-9.0 cm depth. The activity of beta-glucosidase estimated on samples
   from 0-1.3 cm and 1.3-9.0 cm depths, and dehydrogenase activity
   estimated on samples from 1.3-9.0 cm were significantly increased by
   leaf mulching and N fertilizer application. Changes in microbial
   community composition, as indicated by phospholipid fatty acid methyl
   ester analysis, appear to be due to seasonal variations and did not
   reflect changes due to N or leaf amendment treatments. There were no
   negative effects of tree leaf mulching into turfgrass and early data
   suggest this practice will improve soil chemical, physical, and
   biological structure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an overview of the most recent developments in the
   field of geostatistics and describes their application to soil science.
   Geostatistics provides descriptive tools such as semivariograms to
   characterize the spatial pattern of continuous and categorical soil
   attributes. Various interpolation (kriging) techniques capitalize on the
   spatial correlation between observations to predict attribute values at
   unsampled locations using information related to one or several
   attributes. An important contribution of geostatistics is the assessment
   of the uncertainty about unsampled values, which usually takes the form
   of a map of the probability of exceeding critical values, such as
   regulatory thresholds in soil pollution or criteria for soil quality.
   This uncertainty assessment can be combined with expert knowledge for
   decision making such as delineation of contaminated areas where remedial
   measures should be taken or areas of good soil quality where specific
   management plans can be developed. Last, stochastic simulation allows
   one to generate several models (images) of the spatial distribution of
   soil attribute values, all of which are consistent with the information
   available. A given scenario (remediation process, land use policy) can
   be applied to the set of realizations, allowing the uncertainty of the
   response (remediation efficiency, soil productivity) to be assessed. (C)

Abstract = {{Soil resilience has recently been introduced into soil science to
   address sustainability of the soil resource and to combat sail
   degradation. The concept of soil resilience and its relationship to soil
   quality have not been well defined or well developed, The main
   objectives of this paper are to clarify the concept: of soil resilience
   and its relationship to soil quality and to present a framework for its
   assessment. A review of the literature on the assessment and
   quantification of soil resilience is presented and discussed, The
   concept of soil resilience in combination with resistance is presented
   as an important component of soil quality, a key element of
   sustainability. Factors that affect soil resilience and resistance are
   soil type and vegetation, climate, land use, scale, and disturbance
   regime. Maintenance of recovery mechanisms after a disturbance is
   critical for system recovery. Three approaches for assessing soil
   resilience are presented: (i) directly measuring recovery after a
   disturbance, (ii) quantifying the integrity of recovery mechanisms after
   a disturbance, and (iii) measuring properties that serve as indicators
   of those recovery mechanisms. Research is needed in the development of
   indicators or quantitative measures of the ability of soils to recover
   from specific disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Agroforestry systems have been considered sustainable land-use
   alternatives for the humid tropics because they may imitate
   characteristics of natural ecosystems - notably those that have
   beneficial effects on soil properties. The objective of this study was
   to compare the effects of agroforestry systems on selected soil
   properties of Haplic and Dystic Fluvisols, in the Atlantic Region of
   Costa Rica, approximately five years after their establishment. The
   agroforestry systems were established on unmanaged pastures near the La
   Selva Biological Station in 1989 and 1990. The original forest had been
   removed on most of these areas at least 25 years earlier. Three
   components of the agroforestry systems were the tropical hardwoods
   Vochysia ferruginea (Botarrama), V. guatemalensis (Chancho),
   Strypnodendron microstachyum (Vainello) and Hieronyma alchorneoides
   (Pilon). The soil properties studied included physical (soil bulk
   density; 0-10 cm), chemical {[}pH, exchangeable bases, extractable P,
   soil organic C (SOC) and total soil N; 0-50cm] and biological parameters
   (mineralizable C and N and microbial biomass C and N; 0-15 cm). Soils
   were sampled in August 1995. Lower exchangeable bases and soil pH were
   noted in agroforestry treatments as compared to pastures. Extractable P
   was higher in the surface 25 cm of agroforestry plots. Total soil N,
   soil organic C and soil C:N ratios were not influenced by agroforestry
   systems. Higher mineralizable C levels were observed in pasture surface
   soils, but no differences in mineralizable N in soil under pasture and
   agroforestry systems were observed. Soil microbial biomass C and N and
   specific respiratory activity were not significantly different in
   pastures and agroforestry systems. Agroforestry systems did not appear
   to improve soils in this study compared to pasture. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The aim of this review is to present a foundation of present knowledge
   and to describe existing strategies for the development and
   implementation of monitoring systems for soil quality of arable land,
   based on soil-quality indicators. In the review viewpoints are discussed
   on the soil-quality concept, suggested frameworks for its assessment,
   and possible methods for the selection and evaluation of quality
   indicators. These sections are in general terms, without emphasis on
   chemical, physical or biological soil properties. The potential value of
   including microbiological indicators in a monitoring system is discussed
   thoroughly. Several possible microbiological indicators are suggested,
   and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Strategies for the
   selection and sampling of monitoring sites are reviewed, and the
   treatment of samples before analyses is also discussed. In conclusion, a
   framework for using microbiological indicators in a Swedish monitoring
   system is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive land use in the Belling Pampa of Argentina appears to be
   reducing soil quality for crop production. Our objective was to
   establish the best edaphic and/or plant indicators for assessing soil
   quality with regard to functioning as a medium for crop production, Nine
   fields with Typic Argiudoll soils were selected for evaluation bused on
   agriculture history and apparent soil structural stability. Soil
   chemical and physical properties and maize (Zea mays L.) vegetative and
   reproductive characteristics were measured. Multivariate statistical
   analyses were applied to the data to determine potential indicators of
   soil quality, Sail and crop variables explained more than 70\% of the
   variance in soil quality among agricultural histories. The edaphic
   indicators that showed the greatest change from pristine conditions were
   organic C, total N, P, Mg, K, D, Ca, and Zn contents and cation exchange
   capacity, Using crop variables, leaf length, maximum fraction of
   intercepted photosynthetically active radiation, grain yield, kernel
   number, prolificacy, and total dry matter at physiological maturity,
   served to establish a soil quality gradient. Variation of maize growth
   was associated with edaphic indicators of soil quality and revealed the
   importance of soil aggregate stability in determine changes in soil
   quality for crop production.}},

Abstract = {{Litter fall and decomposition from trees in a silvopastoral system is
   considered to be an important factor contributing to soil quality. The
   hypotheses of this study are that different functional types of trees
   and seasonal differences in the growth of the trees affects litter
   quality and quantity and the rate of decomposition. Litter was collected
   in traps from four tree species representing four functional types, i.e.
   black alder (deciduous N-fixer). Tasmanian blackwood (evergreen
   N-fixer), red oak (deciduous non-N-fixer) and Encalyptus (evergreen
   non-N-fixer). The rate of litter decomposition was measured using litter
   bags. A high rare of decay was linked to high amounts of microbial
   activity associated with the lifter and this was affected by the
   differences in N and lignin content of the leaves. The leaf litter which
   exhibited the most rate of rapid decay and cycling of nutrients was that
   from the deciduous N-fixing tree species, which contained low amounts of
   lignin and C and high amounts of N. Tasmanian blackwood also produced
   N-rich litter, but the decay rate was retarded by higher contents of
   lignin. Non-N-fixing tree species produced leaf litter which decayed
   slowly due to both high contents of lignin and low amounts of N,
   regardless of whether the species were deciduous or evergreen. The
   initial lignin content and the lignin-to-N ratio in leaf litter emerge
   as likely controls of the rate of decay and therefore as predictors of
   the relative abilities of the different tree species to contribute
   nutrients to the pasture systems. These litter quality characteristics
   appear to be independent of the functional type categories. Seasonal
   effects on leaf litter quantity and quality were not as important as the
   over-riding chemical differences between tree species. A mixture of
   litter types could be used to manipulate the timing of nutrient release
   to benefit pasture growth. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Alternatives to the traditional small grain-bare fallow system on the
   Canadian Prairies are needed to avoid long-term deterioration of soil
   quality and to stabilize income. Canola (Brassica campestris L.) or pea
   (Piscum sativum L.) replaced traditional bare fallow in a 3-year
   rotation with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) on a Mollic Cryoboralf near
   Beaverlodge, Alberta. Liming (none and 7.5 Mg ha(-1) in 1991) and
   tillage {[}conventional shallow (CT) and zero tillage (ZT)] were
   factorially arranged with crop rotation to assess barley grain and
   stover production during 1993-1995. Barley grain yield was 11+/-5\%
   greater during the first phase following canola or pea than during the
   second phase, During both phases in the rotation, barley yield was
   8+/-5\% greater with pea than with canola. Crop rotation had little
   effect on barley stover production. Liming increased barley grain yield
   17+/-8\% and stover yield 13+/-13\%, which could be attributed to the
   maintenance of soil pH at 6.2+/-0.1 after liming compared with 5.0+/-0.1
   without liming. Zero tillage produced a grain yield advantage and a
   stover yield disadvantage in one of three years, but had no detrimental
   effect on stover or grain yield in other years. Volumetric soil water
   content of the surface 0-0.2 m under ZT was 0.03+/-0.02 m(3) m(-3)
   greater than under CT. Highest grain production (barley-barley-pea,
   limed, ZT) was 4.35+/-0.34 Mg ha(-1), while lowest grain production
   (barley-barley-canola, unlimed, CT) was 2.88+/-0.53 Mg ha(-1). Our
   results indicate that increased barley productivity could be achieved
   with pea compared with canola in rotation. Liming and ZT further
   improved barley yield on this acidic soil in the cold semiarid region of
   the Canadian Prairies. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   1000 ha hunting area(Fig. 1 and 2), and together with 7 variables of
   land use and soil quality correlated per annum in 8 factor analysis
   (Tab. 1 to 8). In each analysis 4 features (factors) of characteristic
   landscape structure were pointed our: Factor 1 = agrarian lowlands - In
   the 8-year period the grain and maize fields, with their positive
   valuations, have an increasing influence on the brown hare population
   density; whereas root crop areas (beet and potatoes) show a decreasing
   effect on the animals. Factor 2 = urban areas - The high loadings of
   traffic areas with reducing valuations were of prime importance for the
   determination of this feature. Factor 3 = coastal region - This
   landscape, situated on the German North Sea coast, shows the very high
   marked values of pasture land with decreasing influence on hares. Factor
   4 = low mountain range The positive woodland valuations, with decreasing
   influence on the brown hare, are responsible for the determination of
   this factor. For all 4 regions we found decreasing loadings of the
   animals. Soil quality shows in the agrarian lowlands, where the hares
   are mostly bagged, a notable drop in advantageous conditions, but an
   increase of conditions condusive to population growth in the other 3
   regions.}},

Abstract = {{Most soil quality guidelines do not distinguish among the various forms
   of metals in soils; insoluble, nonreactive, and nonbioavailable forms
   are deemed as hazardous as highly soluble, reactive, and toxic forms.
   The objective of this study was to better understand the long-term
   effects of copper on microorganisms in relation to its chemical
   speciation in the soil environment. Carbon mineralization processes and
   the global structure of different microbial communities (fungi,
   eubacteria, actinomycetes) are still affected after more than 50 years
   of copper contamination in 20 soils sampled from two different
   agricultural sites. The microbial respiration lag period (LP) preceding
   the beginning of mineralization process increases with the level of soil
   copper contamination and is not significantly affected by other
   environmental factors such as soil pH and soil organic matter (SOM)
   content. The total copper concentration showed the best correlation with
   the LP when each site is considered separately. However, when
   considering the whole set of data, soil solution free Cu2+ activity
   (pCu(2+)) is the best predictor of Cu toxicity determined by LP (quite
   likely because pCu(2+) integrates the soil physicochemical variability).
   The maximum mineralization rate (MMR), even if well correlated with the
   pCu(2+), appears not to be a good biomonitor of copper contamination in
   soils since it is highly sensitive to soil characteristics such as SOM
   content. This study emphasizes the importance of the physicochemical
   properties of the environment on soil heavy metal toxicity and on soil
   toxicological measurements. These properties must be characterized in
   soil toxicological studies with respect to (1) their interactions with
   heavy metals, and (2) their direct impact on the selected biological
   test. The measurement of pCu(2+) to characterize the level of soil
   contamination and of lag period as a bioindicator of metal effects in
   the soil are recognized as useful tools for the evaluation of the
   biological quality of soils.}},

Abstract = {{The response of soil quality attributes to management practices across a
   diverse range of farming systems is key to identifying a robust minimum
   data set (MDS). The objectives of this study were to compare the
   response and consistency of different soil organic matter (SOM)
   attributes to changes in soil management practices in eastern Canadian
   agroecosystems. Soil samples (0-10 cm) were obtained at sites of several
   replicated experiments throughout eastern Canada, and 16 paired
   comparisons were selected to determine the effect of conservation
   (no-tillage, rotations, organic amendments) versus conventional (fall
   moldboard plowing, continuous cropping, no organic amendments)
   management practices. A sensitivity index was calculated for each of the
   attributes by dividing the values for conservation treatments with their
   conventionally managed counterparts (i.e., Conservation/Conventional).
   The index showed that tight fraction (LF) N (1.58) and macro-organic
   matter-N (MOM-N) (1.54) were the most sensitive SOM attributes to
   conservation management practices. Light fraction-C (LF-C),
   macro-organic matter-C (MOM-C) and microbial biomass-C (MB-C) also
   showed high sensitivity to conservation management (1.48, 1.34 and 1.44,
   respectively). The sensitivity index for carbohydrates, whole soil C and
   total N were 1.23, 1.16 and 1.17, respectively. However, the Friedman
   two-way analysis of variance test indicated that the sensitivity of the
   different attributes to conservation management was site specific. For
   example, although LF-N was highly ranked, it did not respond as
   frequently as most of the other attributes. A non-parametric sign test
   showed that whole soil C and N provided the most consistent response to
   conservation management. The average sensitivity index was highest for
   the amendment (1.82) followed by the tillage (1.26) and rotational
   (1.14) conservation management practices, suggesting that organic
   amendments had the greatest impact on most of the attributes. These
   results suggest that for eastern Canadian soils, use of MOM-C and MOM-N,
   MB-C and whole soil C would provide a useful, easy to measure and robust
   MDS.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of seasonal changes in soil biochemical attributes can
   provide valuable information on how crop management and weather
   variables influence soil quality. We sampled soil from the 0- to 7.5-cm
   depth of two long-term crop rotations {[}continuous wheat (Cont W) and
   both phases of fallow-wheat (F-W)] at Swift Current, Saskatchewan, from
   early May to mid-October, 11 times in 1995 and 9 times in 1996. The soil
   is a silt loam, Orthic Brown Chernozem with pH 6.0, in dilute CaCl2. We
   monitored changes in organic C (OC) and total N (TN), microbial biomass
   C (MBC), light fraction C and N (LFC and LFN), mineralizable C (C-min)
   and N (N-min), and water-soluble organic C (WSOC). All biochemical
   attributes, except MBC, showed higher values for Cent W than for F-W,
   reflecting the historically higher crop residue inputs, less frequent
   tillage, and drier conditions of Cent W. Based on the seasonal mean
   values for 1996, we concluded that, after 29 yr, F-W has degraded soil
   organic C and total N by about 15\% compared to Cent W. In the same
   period it has degraded the labile attributes, except MBC, much more. For
   example, WSOC is degraded by 22\%, C-min and N-min by 45\% and LFC and
   LFN by 60-75\%. Organic C and TN were constant during the season because
   one year's C and N inputs are small compared to the total soil C or N.
   All the labile attributes varied markedly throughout the seasons. We
   explained most of the seasonal variability in soil biochemical
   attributes in terms of C and N inputs from crop residues and
   rhizodeposition, and the influences of soil moisture, precipitation and
   temperature. Using multiple regression, we related the biochemical
   attributes to soil moisture and the weather variables, accounting for
   20\% of the variability in MBC, 27\% of that of N-min, 29\% for LFC,
   52\% for C-min, and 66\% for WSOC. In all cases the biochemical
   attributes were negatively related to precipitation, soil moisture,
   temperature and their interactions. We interpreted this to mean that
   conditions favouring decomposition of organic matter in situ result in
   decreases in these attributes when they are measured subsequently under
   laboratory conditions. We concluded that when assessing changes in OC or
   TN over years, measurements can be made at any time during a year.
   However, if assessing changes in the labile soil attributes, several
   measurements should be made during a season or, measurements be made
   near the same time each year.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the response of soil biochemical attributes to crop
   management and growing season weather is important for assessing soil
   quality and fertility. Long-term (38-39 yr) crop rotations on a Black
   Chernozem at Indian Head, Saskatchewan, were sampled (0- to 7.5-cm
   depth) between early May and mid-October, 11 times in 1995 and 9 times
   in 1996. We assessed the effect of cropping frequency {[}fallow-wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) (F-W) vs. F-W-W, vs. Continuous (Cont) W],
   fertilizers (unfertilized vs. N + P applied), straw harvesting, legume
   green-manure (GM) in GM-W-W (unfertilized), and legume-grass hay (H) in
   F-W-W-H-H-H (unfertilized) systems. Changes in organic C and total N
   (OC, TN), microbial biomass C (MBC), light fraction C and N (LFC and
   LFN), mineralizable C and N (C-min and N-min), and water-soluble organic
   C (WSOC) were monitored. Organic C and TN were constant and unaffected
   by rotation phase during the season, but most of the other more labile
   soil biochemical attributes varied during the season. Much of this
   temporal variability was associated with changes in soil moisture,
   temperature and precipitation, and with rhizodeposition in some cases.
   Whenever conditions favoured rapid decomposition in situ (e.g., high
   moisture, temperature and/or precipitation) we obtained lower values for
   the more labile attributes in subsequent laboratory measurements.
   Seasonal trends in the more labile attriutes were more pronounced in
   1995 (a much wetter year) than in 1996, and the proportion of the
   variability attributable to weather conditions was greater in 1995 than
   in 1996 (viz., R-2 ranged from 20 to 44\% in 1996 and from 37 to 60\% in
   1995). Seasonal variability was greater in the more fertile treatments
   {[}e.g., Cent W (Fert) and F-W-W-H-H-H) than in F-W or Cent W (Unfert).
   Seasonal variability in LF was unaffected by cropping. Light fraction
   was lower in 1995 than 1996 because of faster decomposition in 1995 (335
   mm of growing season precipitation compared to 157 mm in 1996).
   Microbial biomass was not influenced by cropping in 1996, but in 1995 it
   was higher in cropped than in fallow phases of the rotations, suggesting
   a positive effect of rhizodeposition. Water-soluble organic C was
   greatest in the more fertile treatments and in cropped than in fallow
   phases. Mineralizable C and N were greater in cropped than in fallow
   rotation phases in 1995, but unaffected by cropping in 1996. Further,
   C-min and N-min were higher in 1996 than in 1995, likely due to more
   rapid decomposition in the wetter 1995. Over the last 10 yr of this
   experiment LFC and C-min have increased markedly in the more fertile
   treatments {[}e.g., Cent W (Fert), F-W-W-H-H-H], but have hardly changed
   in the less fertile treatments such as F-W or Cent W (Unfert). In this
   period the less labile attributes (e.g., OC) have hardly changed in any
   treatment.}},

Title = {{How grazing and soil quality affect native and exotic plant diversity in
   rocky mountain grasslands}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{We used multiscale plots to sample vascular plant diversity and soil
   characteristics in and adjacent to 26 long-term grazing exclosure sites
   in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and South Dakota, USA. The exclosures
   were 7-60 yr old (31.2 +/- 2.5 yr, mean +/- 1 SE). Plots were also
   randomly placed in the broader landscape in open rangeland in the same
   vegetation type at each site to assess spatial variation in grazed
   landscapes. Consistent sampling in the nine National Parks, Wildlife
   Refuges, and other management units yielded data from 78 1000-m(2) plots
   and 780 1-m(2) subplots. We hypothesized that native species richness
   would be lower in the exclosures than in grazed sites, due to
   competitive exclusion in the absence of grazing. We also hypothesized
   that grazed sites would have higher native and exotic species richness
   compared to ungrazed areas, due to disturbance (i.e., the
   intermediate-disturbance hypothesis) and the conventional wisdom that
   grazing may accelerate weed invasion. Both hypotheses were soundly
   rejected. Although native species richness in l-mz subplots was
   significantly higher (P < 0.05) in grazed sites, we found nearly
   identical native or exotic species richness in 1000-m(2) plots in
   exclosures (31.5 +/- 2.5 native and 3.1 +/- 0.5 exotic species),
   adjacent grazed plots (32.6 +/- 2.8 native and 3.2 +/- 0.6 exotic
   species), and randomly selected grazed plots (31.6 +/- 2.9 native and
   3.2 +/- 0.6 exotic species). We found no significant differences in
   species diversity (Hill's diversity indices, N1 and N2), evenness
   (Hill's ratio of evenness, E5), cover of various life-forms (grasses,
   forbs, and shrubs), soil texture, or soil percentage of N and C between
   grazed and ungrazed sites at the 1000-m(2) plot scale. The species lists
   of the long-ungrazed and adjacent grazed plots overlapped just 57.9 +/-
   2.8\%. This difference in species composition is commonly attributed
   solely to the difference in grazing regimes. However, the species lists
   between pairs of grazed plots (adjacent and distant 1000-m(2) plots) in
   the same vegetation type overlapped just 48.6 +/- 3.6\%, and the
   ungrazed plots and distant grazed plots overlapped 49.4 +/- 3.6\%.
   Differences in vegetation and soils between grazed and ungrazed sites
   were minimal in most cases, but soil characteristics and elevation were
   strongly correlated with native and exotic plant diversity in the study
   region. For the 78 1000-m(2) plots, 59.4\% of the variance in total
   species richness was explained by percentage of silt (coefficient =
   0.647, t = 5.107, P < 0.001), elevation (coefficient = 0.012, t = 5.084,
   P < 0.001), and total foliar cover (coefficient = 0.110, t = 2.104, P <
   0.039). Only 12.8\% of the variance in exotic species cover
   (log(10)cover) was explained by percentage of clay (coefficient =
   -0.011, t = -2.878, P < 0.005), native species richness (coefficient =
   -0.011, t = -2.156, P < 0.034), and log(10)N (coefficient = 2.827, t =
   1.860, P < 0.067). Native species cover and exotic species richness and
   frequency were also significantly positively correlated with percentage
   of soil N at the 1000-m(2) plot scale.
   Our research led to five broad generalizations about current levels of
   grazing in these Rocky Mountain grasslands: (1) grazing probably has
   little effect on native species richness at landscape scales; (2)
   grazing probably has little effect on the accelerated spread of most
   exotic plant species at landscape scales; (3) grazing affects local
   plant species and life-form composition and cover, but spatial variation
   is considerable; (4) soil characteristics, climate, and disturbances may
   have a greater effect on plant species diversity than do current levels
   of grazing; and (5) few plant species show consistent, directional

Abstract = {{The great importance of the soil microorganisms for soil quality is
   generally accepted. Therefore the ecological evaluation of agricultural
   management systems, crops and agricultural practices requires special
   attention to be given to the soil microbiological processes. In order to
   evaluate results of microbiological soil investigations, an evaluation
   scheme is necessary which is defined by reference values and reference
   ranges and their importance relating to soil quality.
   In the here presented work we elaborated and compared several procedures
   to define reference values and reference ranges for microbiological
   parameters and we propose an evaluation scheme that enables a more
   profound interpretation of soil microbiological results.
   A data set of thorough investigations of 220 winter cereal fields
   including microbiological, chemical and physical parameters was used to
   elaborate and test different procedures to define reference ranges for
   microbiological parameters.
   The most appropriate procedure is to calculate a multiple regression
   model to predict an expected value of a microbiological parameter
   depending on abiotic parameters (C-org content, pH, clay and sand
   content) of the respecting site.
   The predicted value is designated as reference value and the
   confidential limits of the predicted value are used to define reference
   ranges for an evaluation scheme. Reference ranges calculated by this
   procedure really correspond to the properties of this site, but they
   have to be calculated for each site separately.
   The calculated regression model was applied to data from other
   investigations as well as to some literature data. The application of
   the model for the microbial biomass indicates that it is, valid not only
   at the investigated 220 sites but can generally be used at any other
   site.
   The evaluation scheme presented here is based on reference ranges and
   represents a valuable tool for the evaluation and interpretation of
   microbiological investigations of soil. It allows for a more plausible
   evaluation of the results of individual biological parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive or inappropriate use of agricultural soils risks jeopardizing
   their agronomic potential, particularly their biological quality. The
   reasons for this degradation vary depending on the region and the
   pedo-climatic conditions, but inevitably lead to a marked drop in
   organic matter contents and an increase in soil erosion, thus
   exacerbating the constraints on agricultural production. To promote the
   conditions for sustainable agriculture, we describe a soil biological
   fertility approach including the creation of a multi-disciplinary and
   multilateral training, research and development structure, in the aim of
   proposing sustainable soil biological fertility management methods and
   ensuring their rational, cost-effective use whilst respecting ecological
   imperatives. The training component will cover biological measurements
   and their use as fertility indicators: microbial biomass, stable organic
   matter reserves, rhizobium and endomycorrhizal fungus populations, and
   the role of symbiotic microorganisms in maintaining and improving soil
   quality. The research component will be devoted to biological indicators
   of soil quality. Varying types of expertise will be pooled to develop
   and validate a coherent set of standard methods for evaluating soil
   biological quality. For the development component, the proposal plans to
   call upon the main development protagonists: farmers, development
   agencies and production companies, whose soils hold the key to the
   development of viable, sustainable agriculture, to integrate biological
   soil fertility management methods into their respective operations.
   Diagnostic studies of the rural environment are a good way of
   identifying the advantages and disadvantages of this soil biological
   fertility approach.}},

Abstract = {{The sustainability issues associated with agricultural development are a
   growing concern worldwide. This study focussed on farmers' attitudes
   about environmental degradation and long term productivity loss that may
   result from implementation of modern agricultural technologies. The
   study was conducted in a selected area of Bangladesh and field level
   data were collected from the sampled fanners through personal
   interviewing. Findings revealed that more than two-thirds of the fanners
   confronted either a medium or high level of environmental problems due
   to intensive cultivation. Their main concerns were stress on soil
   fertility, loss of essential aquatic life, and reduction of earthworms
   and other beneficial organisms in soil. The fanners' recommended
   solutions were production of high yielding crop varieties with
   conservation management practices, and the balanced use of chemical
   fertilizers and organic manures. To apply these techniques, the top
   expectation of the farmers was to receive subsidies for agricultural
   inputs, and get easy-term credit from the government or non-government
   organizations. Interestingly, just half the farmers in the study area
   possessed a less than favorable attitude towards sustainability issues
   of agricultural development. In other words, to them these issues were
   of low or marginal priority. Only 6\% of them expressed a highly
   favorable attitude thigh priority) and 44\% expressed a moderate
   attitude. Based on correlations, the individual farmer's age, education,
   family size, organizational participation, television exposure,
   communication behavior and environmental problem confrontation were
   identified as the main determinants of their attitudes about
   sustainability issues, Hence, these factors should be considered when
   formulating programs and policies for agriculture development that aim
   for long-term sustainability.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{4-10}},
Abstract = {{Disease suppressiveness can be viewed as one of the characteristics of a
   healthy soil. From an ecological point of view, soil health implies
   ecosystem stability, diversity, functional connectedness, and resilience
   in response to a disturbance or stress; Disease suppression can be
   Viewed as a manifestation of ecosystem stability and health. Previously
   suggested indicators for soil health and disease suppression have mainly
   been lists of variables that were correlated to more or less disturbed
   soils (ranging from conventional and organic agricultural soils, to
   grassland and forest soils) or to root disease conduciveness. We suggest
   that indicators for soil health and disease suppression could be found
   by monitoring responses of the soil microbial community and nutrient
   availability to the application of a disturbance or stress. This
   approach is illustrated by wave-like responses of microbial communities,
   soluble carbon and nitrogen, and damping-off by Pythium spp. after
   incorporation of a cover crop in soil. The amplitudes of the waves were
   mostly wider when cover crop debris was incorporated in fallow soil than
   in cover cropped soil. Pythium damping-off was less severe in
   cover-cropped soil. These results suggest that the proposed approach to
   the search for indicators of soil health and disease suppression, namely
   measuring the amplitude of fluctuations in microbial populations and
   resilience to a disturbance or stress, is promising.}},

Title = {{Effect of contrasting farm management on vegetation and biochemical,
   chemical, and biological condition of moist steepland soils of the South
   Island high country, New Zealand}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{847-865}},
Abstract = {{A question of economic, social, and land-use importance in the
   predominantly steep South Island high country tussock grasslands of New
   Zealand is whether these lands can be sustainably farmed by oversowing
   introduced grasses and legumes and using fertilisers. To help answer
   this question, we compared vegetation and soil chemical, biochemical,
   and biological properties on Brown soils (Dystrudepts) on adjacent land
   areas which have been differently managed since 1978. One area had never
   been fertilised or oversown. The other had been oversown with grasses
   and clovers and received about 1100 kg/ha of sulfur-superphosphate
   between 1979 and 1997.
   Oversowing and fertilising reduced the amount of bare ground and
   transformed the vegetation to a species composition dominated by the
   introduced adventives Anthoxanthum odoratum and Agrostis capillaris.
   Fertilising raised soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, increased
   A-horizon thickness, and raised exchangeable cation values. All of the
   phosphorus (P) applied to the fertilised area was accounted for in the
   top 15 cm of soil, but has accumulated in the relatively unavailable
   organic form. Oversowing and fertilising significantly (P < 0.05)
   increased microbial biomass C, N, and P relative to values in
   unfertilised soils. The microbial biomass C: N and C: P ratios were
   significantly (P < 0.05) lower in fertilised soils. Fertilised soils had
   significantly more (P < 0.05) mineralised N than unfertilised soils.
   Populations of 5 groups of soil fauna (Scarabaeidae, nematodes,
   enchytraeids, rotifers, tardigrades) were higher in fertilised soils.
   Nematode species parasitic or pathogenic for clovers were present in
   greater numbers on fertilised soils. A combination of fertility decline
   (in particular, P immobilisation as organic P) and nematode damage may
   be the reason for the low clover cover on fertilised sites, and may
   explain the widely observed clover `flush' and decline common to
   oversown high country.
   We conclude that there is no simple measure of `soil quality' that can
   be used as a sustainability indicator in moist New Zealand high country.
   Nor can sustainability be judged purely on biological, biochemical, and
   chemical critieria. Although many of the erects associated with
   oversowing and fertilising, such as increased organic matter content of
   A horizons and increased biological activity, are positive, these erects
   must be balanced against the economic risk associated with being
   committed to a high-input farming system, the loss of low-producing but
   resilient native species, and increase of plant-pathogenic nematodes.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH}},

Pages = {{867-889}},
Abstract = {{The erects of green manured field pea (Pisum sativum L.), low-input (LI)
   wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (seeding rate of 40 kg/ha and 85 kg/ha of
   diammonium phosphate), and high-input (HI) wheat (seeding rate of 100
   kg/ha, 85 kg/ha of diammonium phosphate, and 180 kg/ha of urea) sown as
   rotation crops after cotton on soil quality; cotton growth, yield and
   nutrient uptake; and gross margins (\$AU/ha and \$AU/ML of irrigation
   water) were evaluated from 1993 to 1998 in an irrigated Vertosol in the
   central-west of New South Wales. Soil quality indicators monitored were
   aggregate stability (dispersion index), compaction (air-filled
   porosity), soil resilience to structural destruction (as geometric mean
   diameter of soil aggregates formed after puddling and drying of soil),
   exchangeable cations, calcium carbonate, nitrate-N, pH, organic C,
   development of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), and incidence of cotton root
   diseases (black root rot). In comparison with wheat, field pea increased
   soil nitrate-N levels during the early stages of the experiment and
   formed smaller aggregates after puddling and drying, but it was
   ineffective in ameliorating soil compaction. In contrast wheat was very
   effective in ameliorating soil compaction. Nitrate-N values under
   wheat-cotton rotations increased with time such that after 4 years they
   were similar to that under the field pea-cotton rotation. Soil chemical
   fertility indicators such as organic C, pH, EC, and exchangeable cations
   were not affected consistently by either wheat or field pea, whereas
   minimum tillage, retention of crop residues, and cropping phase (i.e.
   rotation crop or cotton) affected them more. A net decrease in organic C
   and an increase in EC was observed with time in all treatments. By
   sowing either field pea or wheat, the mycorrhizal colonisation of cotton
   roots was improved. Black root rot incidence was increased 3-fold by
   sowing field pea, but was not significantly affected by wheat. Cotton
   lint yield was unaffected by rotation crop, although profitability shown
   as gross margins/ha and gross margins/ML irrigation water were greater
   with wheat compared with field pea. Gross margins/ha were in the order
   HI wheat > LI wheat > field pea, and gross margins/ML irrigation water
   were in the order LI wheat > HI wheat > field pea. In terms of
   ameliorating soil compaction, minimising black root incidence, and
   maximising returns to the cotton grower, wheat is a better rotation crop
   than field pea. The decision to apply fertiliser and sow wheat at a
   higher seeding rate will depend on whether land or water is the major
   limiting factor.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the physical condition of 3 soils used for intensive dairy
   farming in the Waikato Region was undertaken. The study was to determine
   the existing physical condition of the soil, the possible long-term
   changes from pugging damage, and the most appropriate measurements and
   depth for monitoring change in soil physical properties under dairying.
   Four dairy farms were selected on each of 3 soils (an Allophanic Soil
   and 2 Gley Soils). On each farm, 3 sites that corresponded to never
   trodden, usual ('average' paddock and pasture condition for the farm),
   and previously pugged (pugged >18 months ago) pasture histories were
   sampled. Undisturbed soil cores were collected at 50-mm depth increments
   to 250 mm for determination of bulk density, total porosity, saturated
   and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, proportion of pores >30 and 60
   mu m, and aggregate size class.
   Results showed pugging was having a long-term effect on soil physical
   properties of all 3 soils, including the well-drained Allophanic Soil
   that rarely pugged. All measurements showed a decline in values for soil
   properties from never trodden to previously pugged. The greatest changes
   were in hydraulic conductivity, proportion of pores, and aggregate size
   (>60 and <20 mm).
   The most appropriate depth increment for measuring differences between
   treatments was found to be 50-100 mm. A comparison of previously pugged
   to never trodden at this depth showed that hydraulic conductivity had
   decreased by 80\%, pore size by 46\% (except for Allophanic Soil), and
   the proportion of aggregates >60 mm in diameter had increased at least
   4-fold.
   Farming practices that minimise pugging damage, such as on/or grazing,
   need to be encouraged. It is possible that such programs may permit the
   soil to recover to a physical state similar to never trodden sites.}},

Abstract = {{We studied soil microarthropod communities along livestock grazing
   disturbance gradients, inside and outside grazing exclosures, and on
   areas subjected to restoration efforts (herbicide and bulldozing) in
   order to test the suitability of mites as indicators of rangeland soil
   quality. We found that mite numbers generally increased with decreased
   grazing disturbance. Soil microarthropods appeared to respond to a
   complex of factors including soil compaction, depth to an impervious
   soil layer, below-ground vegetative biomass, and residual effects of
   herbicide. All of our study plots, except those that had been herbicide
   treated, were dominated by microbivorous mites of the family
   Nanorchestidae. The numerical responses of mites, especially
   nanorchestids, appeared to provide a sensitive indicator of ecosystem
   health in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland.}},

Abstract = {{The effects on soil condition of increasing periods under intensive
   cultivation for vegetable production on a Typic Haplohumult were
   compared with those of pastoral management using soil biological,
   physical and chemical indices of soil quality. The majority of the soils
   studied had reasonably high pH, exchangeable cation and extractable P
   levels reflecting the high fertilizer rates applied to dairy pasture and
   more particularly vegetable-producing soils. Soil organic C (C(org))
   content under long-term pasture (>60 years) was in the range of 55 g C
   kg(-1) to 65 g C kg(-1). With increasing periods under vegetable
   production soil organic matter declined until a new equilibrium level
   was attained at about 15-20 g C kg(-1) after 60-80 years. The loss of
   soil organic matter resulted in a linear decline in microbial biomass C
   (C(mic)) and basal respiratory rate. The microbial quotient
   (C(mic)/C(org)) decreased from 2.3\% to 1.1\% as soil organic matter
   content declined from 65 g C kg(-1) to 15 g C kg(-1) but the microbial
   metabolic quotient (basal respiration/C(mic) ratio) remained unaffected.
   With decreasing soil organic matter content, the decline in arginine
   ammonification rate, fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity,
   earthworm numbers, soil aggregate stability and total clod porosity was
   curvilinear and little affected until soil organic C content fell below
   about 45 g C kg(-1). Soils with an organic C content above 45 g C kg(-1)
   had been under pasture for at least 30 years. At the same C(org)
   content, soil biological activity and soil physical conditions were
   markedly improved when soils were under grass rather than vegetables. It
   was concluded that for soils under continuous vegetable production,
   practices that add organic residues to the soil should be promoted and
   that extending routine soil testing procedures to include key physical
   and biological properties will be an important future step in promoting
   sustainable management practices in the area.}},

Abstract = {{Research at three locations in the southeastern U.S. is quantifying
   changes in soil quality and soil carbon storage that occur during
   production of biomass crops compared with row crops. After three growing
   seasons, soil quality improved and soil carbon storage increased on
   plots planted to cottonwood, sycamore, sweetgum with a cover crop,
   switchgrass, and no-till corn. For tree crops, sequestered belowground
   carbon was found mainly in stumps and large roots. At the Tennessee
   site, the coarse woody organic matter storage below ground was 1.3 Mg
   ha(-1) yr(-1), of which 79\% was stumps and large roots and 21\% fine
   roots. Switchgrass at the Alabama site also stored considerable carbon
   belowground as coarse roots, Most of this carbon storage occurred mainly
   in the upper 30 cm, although coarse roots were found to depths of
   greater than 60 cm. Biomass crops contributed to improvements in soil
   physical quality as well as increasing belowground carbon sequestration.
   The distribution and extent of carbon sequestration depends on the
   growth characteristics and age of the individual biomass crop species.
   Time and increasing crop maturity will determine the potential of these
   biomass crops to significantly contribute to the overall national goal
   of increasing carbon sequestration and reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Decomposition of plant material, compost, or mulch may be monitored or
   predicted by measuring certain key parameters in live or senescent
   material. Lignin is one of the key parameters to measure as it provides
   an indication of soil quality. This study evaluates the most promising
   detergent clean-up procedures for pre-treating plant material to provide
   a more rapid method for lignin determination. Performance was tested
   with a variety of plant material, typical of vegetation analyzed in
   decomposition, nutrient cycling and natural ecosystem studies.
   Lignin-nitrogen (N) and fiber-N residues were also determined to assess
   the efficiency of the clean-up processes. Good agreement was obtained
   for lignin on a range of plant material between the time-consuming
   classical Klasson method and either modified neutral detergent fiber
   (NDF) excluding sodium sulphite and Dekalin, or the acidified detergent
   fiber (ADF) pre-treatments. We recommend either of the detergent
   pretreatment procedure as they provide rapid and effective preliminary
   steps for precise lignin determination. Residual lignin-N following NDF
   and ADF detergent pre-treatment methods were on average respectively
   31\% and 24\% of the plant nitrogen.}},

Pages = {{773-796}},
Abstract = {{Agroforestry is a modern tool to develop sustainable land use and to
   increase food production by growing woody species (trees, shrubs, palms,
   bamboos, etc.) with agricultural crops and/or animals in some form of
   spatial arrangement or temporal sequence. Because these species co-exist
   with the agricultural crops, their allelopathic compatibility may be
   crucial to determine the success of an agroforestry system. A survey of
   the available information reveals that most of the agroforestry species
   (AF species) have negative allelopathic effects on food and fodder
   crops. Therefore, it is desirable to do further research in this
   direction so that AF species with no or positive allelopathic effects on
   the companion crops may be promoted for agroforestry programs. As AF
   species remain a part of the agroecosystem for a longer period, and most
   of them produce a large amount of leaves and litter, their
   allelochemicals may play an important role in developing an eco-friendly
   pest management strategy. Besides these generally studied aspects of
   allelopathy, some comparatively newer aspects of research have been
   identified, such as evaluation of qualitative yield of agroforestry
   systems, selective behavior of the allelochemicals, effect on soil
   quality, and the role of tree allelochemicals in animal and human
   nutrition. If given due consideration, allelopathy could play a pivotal
   role in conservation of the highly threatened environment, biodiversity,
   natural resource base, and making agriculture more sustainable through
   broadening the scope of agroforestry.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological management is gaining acceptance as an encompassing
   philosophy in forest resource management. In keeping with this new
   paradigm, the Canadian Standards Association is creating a forest
   certification process to ensure that forest products are generated
   through sustainable forestry. However, a great deal of research is
   needed to develop and assess soil indicators of ecological
   sustainability. This paper discusses the role and usefulness of
   microbial indicators of soil quality in the ecological management of
   forests and the forest certification process. Suitable microbial
   indicators of soil conservation should be closely linked to critical
   ecological processes, should be documented properly across various
   ecosystem types, should be easy to use, and must evolve with new
   scientific knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{A case study was undertaken to evaluate the performance of Vetiver used
   in NWDPRA in Nashik district. It indicates that ``the establishment of
   Vetiver and its survival percentage were directly correlated to soil
   type, depth of soil, quality of planting material and other managerial
   factors like the problem of stray cattle. In scarcity zone, use of
   Vetiver as a conservation measure failed, except in a few drainage line
   treatments. In sub-mountain zone drainage line treatments like live
   check dam and loose boulder structures showed excellent results, while
   land treatment had only narrow success. Instead of planting Vetiver
   merely as a barrier, a minor engineering support has given better
   results. It enhances the infiltration rate of the nearby plantation,
   arrests the silt along with fertile soil results into profuse growth of
   Vetiver and early achievement of predicted objectives. It also serves as
   identifying mark and helps during the tillage operations, especially in
   summer. In sub-mountain zone, the survival percentage of Vetiver was
   highest in live check dam, supported by minor engineering structure
   (64.56\%). It was followed by loose boulder structure, which was
   reinforced by Vetiver at 47.87\%. Thirdly, land treatment named as
   contour vegetative hedges gave the lowest survival at 41.56\%. The
   overall conclusion is that dry spell adversely affects the survival
   percentage of Vetiver. The average rainy days in sub-mountain zone were
   75 while in scarcity zone it was only 25. The dry spell thereafter and
   the problem of stray cattle causes the mortality of Vetiver. However,
   Vetiver in good survival situations gave excellent results in terms of
   soil erosion control and moisture conservation, which account for good
   land returns, i.e., crop production. Sowing along with contour
   vegetative hedges gave 35.30\% increased yield of Eleusine carcana in
   sub-mountain zone, 32.52\% more yields of Pennisetum typhoides and
   28.69\% more yields of Sorghum vulgare in scarcity zone as compared to
   nontreated areas. There was also significant soil loss reduction caused
   by surface runoff, in sub-mountain zone soil loss reduction was 31.35\%
   and 54.02\% respectively in shallow and medium deep soil. While in
   scarcity zone it was 12.79\% for shallow soil as compared to non-treated
   area. Along with this soil loss reduction, crops also withstand better
   in stress conditions.{''}}},

Abstract = {{While previous empirical analysis of deforestation focused on
   population, this paper builds from a model of land use which suggests
   many determinants of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. I derive a
   deforestation equation from this model and test a number of those
   factors using county-level data for the period 1978-1988. The data
   include a satellite deforestation measure which allows improved
   within-country analysis. The major empirical finding is the significance
   of both land characteristics (such as soil quality and vegetation
   density) and factors affecting transport costs (such as distance to
   major markets and both own- and neighboring-county roads). Government
   development projects also appear to affect clearing, although credit
   infrastructure does not. However, as such policies themselves may be
   functions of other factors, estimated effects of policies must be
   interpreted with some caution. Finally, the population density does not
   have a significant effect on deforestation when many potential
   determinants are included. However, a quadratic specification reveals a
   more robust result: the first migrants to a county have greater impact
   than later immigrants. This implies that the distribution of population
   affects its impact. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most common dryland crop
   grown in the central Great Plains. Producers in this region include
   fallow in the rotation to minimize yield variability due to erratic
   precipitation. However, fallow degrades soil quality by increasing
   erosion potential and loss of organic matter. Fortunately, minimum-till
   production systems and residue management improve water use efficiency
   by plants, thus producers can crop more frequently. We evaluated eight
   rotations comprised of various sequences of winter wheat (W), corn (Zea
   mays L.) (C), prose millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) (M), sunflower
   (Helianthus annuus L.) (S), and fallow (F) in comparison to W-F at Akron
   CO. Our goal was to identify rotations that can replace W-F to minimize
   the frequency of fallow. The sob was a Weld silt loam (Aridic
   Paleustoll). Continuously cropping with WC-M and W-M almost doubled
   total grain yield compared with the conventional system of W-F. Other
   rotations such as W-C-F, W-C-S-F, and W-C-M-F yielded >60\% more on an
   annualized basis than W-F. Winter wheat yield increased with longer time
   intervals between wheat crops. Sunflower yielded the most when grown
   only once every 4 yr; more frequent cropping favored diseases. Sunflower
   reduced yield of the following crop, especially during dry years. Yield
   variability was highest with corn and sunflower, whereas prose millet
   showed the least variability. Producers can manage yield variability by
   diversifying crops in the rotation, as annualized yield variability of
   W-M and W-C-M was similar to W-F. With residue maintenance and minimum
   tillage, producers can crop more frequently, thus increasing land
   productivity while minimizing the frequency of fallow in this semiarid
   region.}},

Volume = {{52}},

Pages = {{92-99}},

Abstract = {{Despite the importance of soil characteristics for classifying riparian
   ecosystem types and evaluating ecosystem or range condition, little
   information exists on western riparian area soils or the factors that
   influence them. We examined the effects of drainage basin geology and
   water table depth on soil morphology and soil physical and chemical
   properties of meadow sites in central Nevada. We described and analyzed
   the soils of meadows that occurred in 4 drainages with different geology
   and that exhibited high water tables (0 to -20 cm from the surface),
   intermediate water tables (-30 to -50 cm), and low water tables (-60 to
   -80 cm). Pedons of high water tables sites had thick O(e) horizons,
   dark, fine-textured A horizons, no B horizons, and lower C horizons high
   in coarse fragments. In contrast, pedons of low water tables sites were
   characterized by deep, dark and organic-rich A horizons, cambic B
   horizons, and deep rooting profiles. High water tables sites had higher
   organic matter, total nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, and
   extractable potassium, but lower pH than low water table sites. Also,
   high water table sites had lower percentage sand, lower bulk densities,
   and higher soil moisture retention. The importance of organic matter was
   evidenced by strong positive product moment correlations for organic
   matter and total nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, and extractable
   potassium. Significant differences in pH, extractable potassium and
   extractable phosphorus existed among drainages that were explainable
   largely from the parent materials. Drainages with chert, quartzite, and
   limestone had higher silt and clay, neutral pH, and high levels of
   extractable phosphorus. Drainages formed in acidic volcanic tuffs,
   rhyolites and breccia were characterized by coarser textured soils and
   low pH and extractable phosphorus. In riparian areas, soil water table
   depth interacts with soil parent material to significantly affect soil
   morphology and soil physical and chemical properties. Because these
   factors vary over both large and small spatial scales, differences among
   sites must be carefully interpreted when classifying ecosystems or
   evaluating ecosystem condition.}},

Abstract = {{CRP lands in eastern Washington were eligible for dryland cropping
   production as of 1995. Conservation and conventional take-put practices
   were assessed at eight sites throughout eastern Washington to determine
   changes in soil quality parameters. The trials tested different tillage
   options: direct-seed/spring plant (DSP), conventional tillage/spring
   take-out (CSP), or conventional tillage/summer fallow (CSF). The eastern
   Washington sites range in annual precipitation from 23 to 36 cm (?? to
   ?? in) and in soil organic matter from 1.06 to 2.60\%. Microbial
   biomass, readily-mineralized carbon (RMC), dehydrogenase activity, pH,
   organic matter content (OM), nitrate and ammonium concentrations,
   moisture, bulk density, and aggregate stability were monitored from 1995
   to 1996. Results showed that RMC and pH were lower after one year in
   conventionally-tilled plots as compared to CRP grassland. The
   direct-seed samples were more like CRP grassland with respect to pH,
   dehydrogenase activity, and RMC than conventional tillage treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality indicators may be useful for evaluating public policies
   such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The objective of this
   study was to determine how CRP affected several physical, chemical, and
   biological indicators of soil quality. Soil aggregate stability and size
   distribution, bulk density, total organic C and N, nitrate-N,
   ammonium-N, pH, cation exchange capacity, microial biomass C and N, soil
   respiration, fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, fungal hyphal length, and
   ergosterol concentrations were measured in paired CRP and cropland sites
   in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Washington. CRP sites in Iowa
   generally had a higher percentage of water stable soil aggregates than
   cropland sites. In Minnesota, the mean aggregate diameter was
   significantly higher in CRP than cropland samples, but differences in
   North Dakota were not significant. In all states, microbial biomass
   carbon was 17 to 64\% higher at CRP sites than at cropland or fallow
   sites. Nitrate-N was 18 to 74\% higher in cropland than CRP sites. Soil
   respiration values were greater (but not significantly different) in CRP
   than cropland sites in all four states. Hyphal length, measured only in
   Iowa, increased 26 to 62\% under CRP. CRP samples had higher ergosterol
   only in Henry County, Iowa, where cropland was chisel plowed and disced
   each year. Overall, soil biological indicators showed more significant
   differences than either chemical or physical indicators. This
   multi-state project shows that several soil quality indicators were
   improved by placing highly erodible cropland into perennial grass, and
   that with refinement, those indicators could be used to assess long-term
   impacts of agricultural management practices.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to evaluate four approaches to point-scale
   assessment of soil quality: farmers' perceptions and field-descriptive,
   field-analytical, and laboratory-analytical assessments. Twenty-four
   conventional and organic farmers were paired within ecoregions, and
   perceptions of soil quality indicators on their ``good{''} and
   ``problem{''} soils were surveyed. Using results from
   laboratory-analytical assessments as a standard, farmers' perceptions
   were accurate or near-accurate in over 75\% of the cases for the
   majority of indicators evaluated in the study. Field-descriptive
   assessments of topsoil depth and soil texture were accurate or
   near-accurate in at least 92\% of the cases. Results from
   field-analytical assessments of electrical conductivity, soil pH, and
   soil nitrate were accurate in at least 46\% of the cases. From an
   assessment-efficiency stand-point, seeking out farmers' perceptions of
   soil quality indicators seems to be an appropriate first iteration to
   point-scale evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation
   Service (NRCS) has been directed to assist local landowners and
   communities to implement watershed improvement practices. The purpose of
   this study was to document current conditions in the Rocky River
   Watershed in North Carolina and the Saluda River Watershed in South
   Carolina. A variety of watershed assessment tools, including the NRCS
   Visual Stream Assessment (VSA), Stream Habitat Assessment (SHA),
   Riparian Vegetation Index (RVI), Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), and
   Land Quality Index (LQI) were wed on a statistically representative
   portion of both watershed. Overall, the SHA, VSA, and RVI rated the
   watersheds' condition as good, whereas the IBI rated them as fair.
   Correlations between IBI and the other indices were poor, perhaps
   indicating these indices measure different features within the
   watersheds. The LQI emphasized the need for better characterization of
   urban land and riparian corridors. Inclusion of suburban lawns with the
   urban land indicator improved correlations between IBI and LQI by 20\%.
   This pilot study suggests further scrutiny in applying quantitative
   stream physical habitat measures to assess watershed renditions. It also
   indicates additional study of the IBI by NRCS. Resources devoted to
   statistical design were valuable and should provide the NRCS with a
   framework for conducting future watershed studies.}},

   central Ohio soils}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{67-84}},
Abstract = {{Tillage methods can have a drastic impact on soil quality, and the
   effects may be cumulative overtime. Therefore, soil analyses were done
   in 1987 to quantify effects of three tillage methods on soil quality
   following 25 years of continuous corn (Zea mays) cultivation on two well
   drained soils at South Charleston and Wooster in central Ohio. Crosby
   soil at South Charleston is classified fine, mixed, mesic Aeric
   Ochraqualf, and Wooster silt loam at Wooster is a fine loamy, mixed,
   mesic, Typic Fragiudalf. The three tillage methods were plow till (PT)
   involving moldboard plowing in the fall, minimum till (MT) involving
   chisel plowing in the fall, and no till (NT) involving direct sowing in
   the residue of the previous crop. Soil samples were taken for 0-60 cm
   depth using a truck-mounted core sampler, with separate for raw zone
   (RZ) and traffic zone (TZ) cores taken for assessment of soil physical
   properties. Soil chemical analyses were done on samples composited by
   mixing equal proportions of soil from RZ and TZ. Soil physical
   properties were measured for the surface 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depths,
   while chemical properties were measured for 0-60 cm depth in 10 cm depth
   increments. There were significant differences in bulk density (Pb)
   between RZ and TZ. The pb of 0-10 cm depth in TZ was more than RZ by
   0.7\% for NT, 6.6\% for MT, and 8.0\% for PT. There were no significant
   differences in pb of 0-10 cm layer due to tillage. Differences in
   moisture retention among tillage methods were not statistically
   significant. Both initial and equilibrium infiltration rate (i(c)) in
   the RZ were in the order of NT > PT > MT. The i(c) did not differ among
   treatments. For the South Charleston site, soil pH was not significantly
   affected by the tillage treatments. Soil pH of the 10-50 cm layer of the
   Wooster site was, however, lower in NT than PT treatment. The 10-50 cm
   layer of the Wooster site also had lower concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+
   and K+ in NT than PT. Trends in SOC content and Bray-P were in the order
   of NT greater than or equal to MT greater than or equal to PT for the
   top 0-20 cm layer, and PT greater than or equal to MT greater than or
   equal to NT for 30-50 cm layer. Exchangeable Mg+ content was
   significantly affected by tillage, and mean contents of Mg+ were in the
   order of PT = MT > NT. The data support the conclusion that 25 years of
   no-till with continuous corn had no deleterious effect on either soil
   physical or chemical quality.}},

   nearby the former plant (soils 1 to 3).
   The total element concentrations of soil 2 were still extremly high.
   The increased metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) and the decreased
   C-mic/C-org-ratios of the sites 1 to 3 indicated a persisting long-term
   influence of the pollutants.
   Soil 2 was characterized by four enhanced enzyme activities and an
   intensive substrat utilization.
   Further more the composition of phospholipid fatty acids proved the
   special quality of the microbial community structure of soil 2.
   The relation of microbial activities per microbial biomass was more
   efficient to indicate the influence of contaminations than the relation
   of microbial activities per soil dry weight.
   High significant correlations were found between the microbial
   parameters and the total concentrations of Cd, F, P and the mobile
   F-content.
   However, the data demonstrate that not a single biological parameter
   would have been sufficient to indicate soil quality.
   Finally, it is interesting to note that even in the most highly
   contaminated soils adequate populations exist to support remediation
   efforts.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we evaluated the effect of the burrowing crab Chasmagnathus
   granulata on the soil quality and on the cordgrass Spartina densiflora
   in a SW Atlantic coastal lagoon (Argentina, 37 degrees 32' S, 57 degrees
   19' W). Soil hardness and percolation rates were higher outside the crab
   inhabited area than inside, and soil profiles showed 2 different strata
   in areas without crabs. Crabs were associated with low soil water
   content, a higher variability in pH, and a homogeneous distribution of
   organic matter. Meiofaunal abundance was lower inside the area inhabited
   by crabs than outside. The water content of aboveground structures of S.
   densiflora was lower inside the crab populated areas. Leaf survival was
   lower inside the area inhabited by crabs than outside. In areas with new
   shoots (after burning by a brush fire) crabs depleted the aboveground
   plant structures. A caging experiment showed that crabs decreased leaf
   survival by herbivory. During the experiment, substrata was covered by
   sediment displaced by crabs, and the area showed less soil hardness and
   lower percolation rates than controls. Crabs decreased water content and
   organic matter on upper sediment layers. Meiofaunal abundance (arachnids
   and insects) was higher in control plots (without crabs) than in
   treatment plots. A field selection experiment showed that crabs
   decreased survival of young stems, but did not affect old stems. All
   this evidence suggests that C, granulata affects cordgrass production by
   herbivory on new shoots, and can change the physical characteristics of
   the environment, which may also indirectly affect S. densiflora
   production. Thus, the general belief that in Spartina marshes only a
   small proportion of primary production is consumed in situ may not apply
   to SW Atlantic Spartina marshes inhabited by crabs.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of long-term field experiments, the impact is demonstrated
   of the periodic application of organic fertilizers on the accumulation
   of organic matter and the development of the micro-pollutant content of
   reclaimed loess soils of the Rhineland lignite mining area under
   agricultural use. The oldest of these experiments ('Berrenrath Humus
   Accumulation Experiment') was begun in 1969. The results show that the
   regular input of organic matter (e.g. manure, waste compost, sewage
   sludge) favors the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM). However,
   the type of organic material applied seems to be less important to the
   long-term accumulation process than the application rate. This is also
   true for composted and uncomposted manure, if the decay of organic
   matter during the composting process is taken into account.
   Nevertheless, the application of similar amounts of organic C in the
   form of manure resulted in a higher accumulation of SOM in a
   nitrogen-reduced farming system. Depending on the treatment,
   accumulation rates were between 0.02 and 0.08\% SOM per year with values
   decreasing with time. From these results, it is estimated that reclaimed
   soils will take much longer to reach the former SOM level than was
   previously assumed. However, it is important to determine which SOM
   level is adequate for different soil functions (e.g. production
   function, filter and buffer function, transformation function), and
   whether the young SOM of reclaimed soils has the same properties as
   older SOM in undisturbed topsoils. As was expected, long-term
   fertilization with sewage sludge and waste compost led to an
   accumulation of some micro-pollutants in the topsoils treated.
   Nevertheless, the observed concentrations are quite low compared to
   background levels in topsoils of rural regions in North
   Rhine-Westphalia.}},

   (Aegilops cylindrica L.) and downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.)
   rhizospheres were also collected for fatty acid analysis. Principal
   component analysis (PCA) of the two soils explained 42\% of the variance
   on PC1, which accounted for Palouse soil. Ritzville soil accounted for
   19\% of the variance on PC2. Factor analysis showed that rhizosphere
   microbial communities from various plant species may differ depending on
   the plant species. Presence of Gram-positive bacteria as identified by
   a15:0, i15:0, a17:0 and i17:0 peaks were similar between rhizosphere and
   nonrhizosphere soils. Gram-negative bacteria characterized by short
   chain hydroxy acids (10:03OH and 12:03OH) as well as cyclopropane acids
   (cy17:0) were higher in rhizosphere soil than nonrhizosphere. This
   indicates a possible shift in the bacterial community to more
   Gram-negative bacteria and fewer Gram-positive bacteria in the
   rhizospheres of the plants species studied.}},

   provide new approaches to achieve the historic mission of Natural
   Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) - to provide producers with
   science-based knowledge of soil properties and the agronomic behavior of

   plant growth (SRPG) and root zone available water-holding capacity for
   digital general soil map units with USGS (1986) Land Use and Land Cover
   maps of the Central Great Plains (CGP) to display croplands with similar
   agronomic behavior and soil productivity. The SRPG values ranged from 7
   to 92 for CGP croplands, with a median value of 52. The SRPG values
   exceeded 60 for 25\% of the 10.2 million hectares of CGP cropland; 21\%
   of CGP cropland had SRPG values <40. Root zone available water-holding
   capacity exceeds 200 mm for more than 6.3 million hectares of CGP

Abstract = {{Winter wheat-fallow is the conventional cropping system in the semiarid
   central Great Plains. Fallow weed control relies on tillage, but this
   practice leads to erosion and loss of organic matter. Cropping systems
   studies in this region, conducted since the early 1980s, are
   demonstrating that annualized yield can be doubled and soil quality
   improved with continuous no-till cropping. However, with only four
   research sites in the central Great Plains, producers question how far
   experimental results may apply across this region, given the extreme
   variation in soil properties and climatic characteristics. Therefore, we
   identified agroecozones of similar soil and climatic characteristics in
   relation to the four cropping systems sites. The winter wheat-fallow
   region can be divided into two agroecozones, with a zone of uncertainty
   identified. Within an agroecozone, soil differences may have a greater
   impact on land productivity than climatic factors.}},

Abstract = {{Poor soil aeration or oxygen deficiency is a major factor limiting
   seedling establishment. Oxygen deficiency in the soil can occur because
   of improper soil management, such as over-irrigation and soil
   compaction; poor soil quality, such as heavy fine-textured soils or
   layered soils with inadequate drainage; excessive rainfall or flooding;
   usage of excessively small containers for transplant production.
   Inferior stand establishment can occur due to the inhibitory effects of
   low aeration on root elongation, proliferation, viability, respiratory
   capacity, carbohydrate accumulation, hormone synthesis, and water and
   nutrient uptake. Plants that are tolerant to low soil aeration may
   develop morphological and anatomical features in roots that facilitate
   oxygen utilization and plant survival of low oxygen stress. These
   adaptive responses include the formation of aerenchyma tissues in the
   root cortex, development of adventitious roots near the soil surface,
   and increases in root diameter.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability of forest and rangeland ecosystems is intricately linked
   with healthy and productive soils. Soils vary widely in their quality.
   Their health is a condition of the soil relative to their inherent
   quality and ability to perform vital soil and ecosystem functions. Soils
   in Pacific Northwest forest and rangeland ecosystems are particularly
   heterogeneous. For example, selected soils from six Ecoregions, have
   organic carbon contents that range from about 40,000 to more than
   800,000 kg/ha. Total nitrogen content ranges from less than 2,000 to
   more than 50,000 kg/ha.
   There is a close relationship between soil quality and health and
   ecosystem quality and health. Ecosystem stresses can be increased by
   management activities that compact soils and alter soil moisture and
   nutrient status and processes. Forest health in Inland Western forests
   is intricately linked with carbon and nutrient cycling. A high
   percentage of soil organisms make their home in the soil and play a
   critical role in the functions of ecosystems. Alteration of soil
   physical and nutrient conditions can alter the incidence of soil borne
   diseases which, in turn, affect the health of ecosystems.
   Specific quantitative soil standards, or thresholds, are needed to
   determine detrimental conditions. The National Forests have established
   a variety of measures of detrimental conditions. A variety of physical
   measures, such as bulk density changes, displacement and erosion, and
   detrimental burn conditions are emphasized.
   Soils vary widely in their resiliency, or ability to rebound from
   impacts. A model of soil resiliency adopted from Szabolcs (1994),
   includes physical, chemical and biological buffering and pedological and
   anthropological soil fluxes. Several soils from six Pacific Northwest
   Ecoregions are rated for their resiliency. Criteria for chemical,
   biological and physical buffering is included.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining health and vigor of ecosystems requires definition of
   thresholds. Soil quality standards, developed by the US Forest Service
   Regions, focus on limiting area of impact, protecting physical soil
   properties, and maintaining some level of organic matter. Soil
   compaction and puddling, displacement and erosion and severe burning are
   specific indicators of detrimental conditions. Monitoring results show
   that many practices can meet soil quality standards, but repeated
   entries, with ground based equipment, often don't meet standards. Soil
   microorganisms may be good early warning indicators of declining
   conditions. Better understanding of below ground communities is
   important for ecosystem sustainability. Collaboration between the
   scientific community and managers needs to improve.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of organic matter is valuable for identifying the
   overall quality of soils. Management will influence soil quality. The
   rate at which quality attributes change may depend upon soil texture and
   environmental conditions. We assessed the effects of tillage (no-tillage
   (NT) vs conventional mechanical tillage (CT)) and fallow frequency
   (continuous wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (Cont W) vs fallow-wheat (F-W))
   on selected soil quality attributes for a silt loam in semiarid
   southwestern Saskatchewan. Measurements were made in the 0-7.5 and
   7.5-15 cm depths after 4, 8 and 12 y of study. After 4 and 8 y, only C
   mineralization (C-min) and N mineralization (N-min) showed significant
   treatment effects, but after 12 y specific respiratory activity (SRA)
   was also significant (P < 0.05). Total organic C and N and microbial
   biomass (MB) were not affected significantly by treatments (P < 0.05)
   even after 12 y. Cropping more frequently resulted in higher C-min,
   N-min and SRA, likely associated with higher crop residue production
   (e.g., correlation of C-min and N-min with mean annual straw production
   was 0.95, significant at P = 0.05). Tillage did not influence straw
   production nor any of the soil quality attributes assessed. The labile
   attributes were more sensitive than total organic C and N to fallow
   frequency, but they were generally less sensitive to method of tillage
   management. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the pilot study ESQUAD the impact of atmospheric deposition of three
   heavy metals (cadmium, copper and lead) and two persistent organic
   pollutants (benzo(a)pyrene and lindane) on the quality of European soils
   and seawater has been calculated.
   Calculations have been made of atmospheric transport and deposition
   using a detailed emissions database for Europe. This enabled deposition
   maps to be produced to a resolution of approximately 50 km. The
   distribution of pollutant concentrations in forest soils was calculated
   for each grid cell using a database of soil property parameters in
   Europe. For the North Sea, a model was used to map long-term
   concentrations in water and sediment, which are due to atmospheric
   deposition and other, non-atmospheric sources.
   The model calculations allowed detailed comparisons of deposition fluxes
   and concentrations of the substances studied with critical loads and
   environmental quality threshold values, including critical loads.
   Although significant uncertainties were identified, the study gives
   insight in how threshold exceedance rates in Europe relate to pollutant
   type, threshold type, environmental compartment and chemophysical phase
   (adsorbed, dissolved). For all pollutants and for all compartments
   exceedances were calculated for at least some of the quality thresholds
   that were chosen.}},

Abstract = {{A nutrient balance study was carried out for 26 farms in three different
   districts in Kenya. Balances for the major nutrients nitrogen,
   phosphorus and potassium were calculated for individual activities
   within the farms and for the entire farms, using Farm-NUTMON, a research
   tool that combines calculation of nutrient flows and balances with
   economic farm analysis. Four flows into the farm (chemical fertilizer,
   organic fertilizer and feeds, atmospheric deposition, nitrogen
   fixation), six flows out of the farm (farm products, other organic
   outputs, leaching, gaseous losses, erosion and human excreta) and six
   internal flows (consumption of external feeds, household waste, crop
   residues, grazing, animal manure, and home consumption of farm products)
   were considered. Data on fertilizer use, use of organic materials,
   yields, home consumption and the management of residues, manure and
   household waste were gathered by interviewing the farmer. Assumptions
   for deposition, leaching and gaseous losses were made by using empirical
   relationships based on literature data (transfer functions). Erosion was
   estimated relating the overall slopes of the farms to soil loss figures.
   The mean balance of all farms was -71 kg N, +3 kg P and -9 kg K ha(-1)
   yr(-1), with large variations between farms and little variation between
   districts. Emissions (leaching, gaseous losses and erosion) were
   estimated to be much higher than immissions (atmospheric deposition and
   N-fixation). Inflows and outflows at field level were much higher for
   cash crops than for food crops. Soil nutrient mining under napier grass
   (Pennisetum purpereum) was severe from high estimated losses in the
   napier-livestock-manure cycle. Based on an evaluation of the results of
   this case study, recommendations were made for improvement to the
   approach. Developing a sustainability indicator for soil fertility
   requires the nutrient balance to be linked to the actual soil nutrient
   stocks and other soil quality indicators. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence suggests that the use? of a single bioassay will
   never provide a full picture of the quality of the environment. Only a
   test battery, composed of bioassays of different animal and plant
   species from different trophic levels will reduce uncertainty allowing
   an accurate assessment of the quality of the environment. III the
   present study a test battery composed of 20 bioassays of varying
   biological endpoints has been compared. Apart from lethality and
   reproductive failure in earthworms, springtails, nematoda, algae and
   vascular plants, these endpoints also included bioavailibility of metals
   (bacteria), heat-shock induction (nematodes, algae), DNA damage
   (bacteria, earthworm, vascular plants), beta-galactosidase (Daphnia) and
   esterase activity (algae) and a range of immunological parameters
   (earthworm). Four chemicals (cadmium, phenol, pentachlorophenol and
   trifluralin) - each representing a different toxic mode of action - were
   applied in a dilution series (from 1 mg/kg up to 1000 mg/kg) onto OECD
   standard soil. The tests have been performed both on these artificially
   contaminated soil samples and on aqueous extracts subsequently obtained
   from these soils. The results show that the immunological parameters and
   the loss of weight in the earthworms were among the most sensitive
   solid-phase assays. Esterase inhibition and heat-shock induction in
   algae were shown to be extremely sensitive whet? applied to soil
   extracts As previously shown at the species level, Ilo single biological
   endpoint was shown to be the most sensitive for all four modes of toxic
   action.}},

Abstract = {{Mt Kinabalu, Borneo, is characterized by a deep elevational gradient and
   mosaics of geological substrates. We chose a pair of two geological
   substrates (sedimentary vs ultrabasic) at five altitudes (800, 1400,
   2100, 2700 and 3100 m a.s.l.). We investigated soil nitrogen (N)
   mineralization and nitrification rates using an incubation technique to
   assay the pattern and control of soil N status in this environmental
   matrix. In situ net mineralization rates decreased with elevation on
   both substrates. The decreasing pattern was linear across altitudes on
   ultrabasic rock, whereas on sedimentary rock it was depressed in the
   middle slope wet cloud zone. Sedimentary sites in this zone had low soil
   redox potential values and this anoxic soil condition might be related
   to slow N mineralization. The in situ rates were significantly greater
   (P < 0.05, ANOVA) on sedimentary than on ultrabasic rock at the same
   altitudes except in the cloud zone. Net mineralization rates of the
   soils that were collected from different elevations and incubated in the
   same conditions were statistically invariable (P > 0.05) among the
   original elevations for sedimentary rock, but were variable (P < 0.05)
   for ultrabasic rock. Those of the soils that were collected from the
   same elevation and incubated at different elevations decreased
   significantly across altitudes (P < 0.05) for sedimentary rock, while
   they were invariable (P > 0.05) for ultrabasic rock. Thus, temperature
   had stronger effects on net N mineralization on sedimentary rock,
   whereas inherent soil quality had stronger effects on ultrabasic rock.
   Controls of soil N mineralization might be different between the two
   substrates, leading to diverse biogeochemical site conditions on
   Kinabalu.}},

Abstract = {{1. From an ecological and environmental point of view, livestock
   husbandry plays a very important role as there is a valuable interaction
   between livestock and natural resources. The objective of this paper is
   to demonstrate the implications of livestock production systems of
   mountain areas of Greece for conservation ecology and pastureland
   biodiversity.
   2. Overgrazing of some mountain pastures and undergrazing of others, due
   to the depopulation of these environmentally difficult areas, have
   resulted in degradation of these areas. The relationship between
   livestock production and nature conservation is, by its nature, complex,
   delicate and sensitive to local conditions. The particular combination
   of farming practices used can be crucial in determining the biological
   richness of different sites. Low-intensity livestock systems - with low
   use of nutrient and agrochemical inputs, relative abundance of
   semi-natural vegetation and relative stability of good management
   practices - can make a positive contribution to the nature resource base
   by enhancing soil quality and increasing biodiversity. Ecological
   studies to determine optimum stocking densities in each region should be
   carried out with parallel adjustment in pastureland management
   regulations and in incentives given to farmers, in order to facilitate
   sustainability, biodiversity and nature conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Particulate organic matter (POM) is more sensitive than total SOM to
   changes in management practices and, accordingly, may indicate changes
   in soil quality. A soil incubation study was conducted to determine the
   effects of added POM (75 to 250 mu m size fraction), or macroorganic
   matter (MOM, 250 to 2000 mu m size fraction) on C and N mineralization
   and microbial and C and N content. A 1 kg composite made from 16
   predominantly silt loam soils was amended with 10 g of POM, MOM or MOM
   ground to a reduced size of 75 to 250 mu m (GMOM). The MOM amendment
   equaled 4.55-fold and POM equaled 1.60-fold of total MOM and POM found
   in the composite soil. Carbon mineralization of MOM and POM after 8
   weeks was approximately 9 and 4\%, respectively of the total MOM and
   POM-C added. Reducing the size of MOM to 75 to 250 mu m did not affect
   mineralization. Nitrogen mineralization was slightly greater in the
   amended soils after 8 weeks and equaled 5 to 6\% of the MOM or POM-total
   N added. Contribution of POM to total mineralized N from soil organic
   matter (SOM) in the composite soil was proportional to the POM content
   in SOM or approximately 12\%. Amended soils had 25 to 42\% more
   biomass-C than the control soil 2 weeks after amendment application.
   After 8 weeks, the amended soils contained about 32\% more biomass-C.
   This increase in biomass-C at 8 weeks accounted for approximately 2\% of
   the added C. At 8 weeks, microbial biomass-N in GMOM-, MOM- and
   POM-amended soils was about 56, 46 and 14\% higher, respectively, than
   in the control soil. These increases were approximately 8\% of the MOM-N
   added and 2\% of the POM-N added. Increases in POM resulted in increases
   in soil respiration and microbial biomass-C and N, which also are
   suggested indicators of soil quality. Therefore, POM may be a suitable
   soil quality indicator that provides similar information as soil
   respiration or microbial biomass determinations. (C) 1998 Published by

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in the use of coal combustion products (fly
   ash and bed ash) at agronomic rates, based on the liming requirements of
   agricultural soils, and at higher rates in technologies for reclamation
   of degraded lands. There is concern, however, that excessive or other
   improper use may have a negative impact on soil quality and the
   environment. To determine the influence of potentially excessive rates
   of coal combustion products on the fate of soil organic N and impacts on
   soil quality, we studied the effects of fly ash and bed ash applied at
   rates of 0, 20, 40, and 80 g kg(-1) soil on the content of organic N in
   soils incubated for 10, 25, or 60 days. Studies comparing the influence
   of these products on the organic N content of the soil showed that
   although applications of ny ash had little influence on the fate of this
   N, application of bed ash caused substantial decreases in the total N
   content of water-extracted soil through the mobilization of organic N.
   Measurements of the changes in acid hydrolyzable N components of organic
   matter in soils treated with high rates of bed ash showed that within
   the first 10 days of incubation, losses of N in the forms of amino
   sugars, amino acids, and hydrolyzable NH4+ could account largely for
   losses of total N in bed ash-amended soils. Decreases in the amino acid
   content of soil organic matter accounted for most of these losses, and
   such decreases were directly related to increases in soil pH caused by
   the bed ash amendment.}},

Abstract = {{Our previous work provided evidence that application of coal combustion
   products (fly ash and bed ash) at rates exceeding liming requirements
   may cause considerable degradation of organic N in soils. To investigate
   the influence of such application rates on the fate of soil organic
   matter, we studied the effects of different amounts (0, 20, 40, and 80 g
   kg(-1) soil) of bed ash and ay ash on the mobilization of organic C in
   soil. The studies showed that whereas fly ash mobilized little or no
   organic C when applied at rates as high as 80 g kg(-1) soil, bed ash
   caused substantial mobilization and loss of soil organic C when applied
   at or above the rate of 20 g kg(-1) soil. Chromatographic and
   spectroscopic methods were used to characterize the different forms of
   carbon mobilized in soil amended with combustion products. These studies
   showed that various forms of organic C were mobilized by bed ash
   treatments such as carbohydrates, phenolic substances, humic substances,
   and amino acids. We found that the total amounts of soil organic C
   mobilized by bed ash treatments were related to increased soil pH and
   with the losses of C associated with increases of soluble humic
   substances. The losses of organic C from soils treated with bed ash were
   found to be as high as 15.5\% of the total soil organic C. These studies
   also provided evidence for stabilization of some forms of soil organic C
   by Ca2+ from bed ash.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the ways in which some bedouin in the Nubian
   Desert of southeastern Egypt take decisions about both the choice of
   site for cultivation and the subsequent management of their soils. It
   explores the complementarity of formal and informal sciences and how
   each might profitably inform the other. Results show that the bedouin
   understand the physical limitations and nutrient supply properties of
   soils, but not aspects such as pH. Decisions on the choice of
   cultivation site are often made with regard to other perceived risks,
   such as soil loss and intermittent inundation, rather than just soil
   quality It is also apparent that there exists among bedouin a plurality
   of indigenous knowledge mediated by factors such as experience, wealth
   levels, household circumstances and production priorities. Understanding
   indigenous knowledge is essential in helping to develop better use of
   the soil in this area, about which little is known and which has only a
   short history of small scale cropping.}},
