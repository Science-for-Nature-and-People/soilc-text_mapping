Abstract = {{1. Grazing is one of the most widespread forms of intensive management
   on Earth and is linked to reductions in soil health. However, little is
   known about the relative influence of herbivore type, herbivore
   intensity and site productivity on soil health. This lack of knowledge
   reduces our capacity to manage landscapes where grazing is a major land
   use.
   2. We used structural equation modelling to assess the effects of recent
   (cattle, sheep, goats, kangaroos and rabbit dung) and historic (cattle,
   sheep/goat livestock tracks) herbivore activity on soil health at 451
   sites across 0.5 M km(2) of eastern Australia. We assessed the direct
   and indirect effects of increasing herbivore intensity, using dung and
   livestock tracks, on 15 morphological, physical and chemical attributes
   that are indicative of soil health, and we used these attributes to
   derive three indices representing the capacity of the soil to maintain
   its structural integrity (stability), cycle nutrients (nutrients) and
   maintain water flow (infiltration).
   3. Grazing had negative effects on the three soil health indices, but
   these effects varied with productivity. Grazing intensity was associated
   with strong reductions in the stability and nutrient indices under low
   productivity, but these effects diminished with increasing productivity.
   Herbivore effects on individual attributes varied in relation to
   productivity level and were strongly herbivore specific, with most due
   to cattle grazing, and to a lesser extent, sheep, goats and rabbits. Few
   effects due to kangaroos or historic grazing by livestock were observed.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that livestock and
   rabbits degrade soil health through grazing, and its effects are
   strongest under low or moderate productivity; however, kangaroo effects
   are benign. Our findings support calls for resource management agencies
   to consider site productivity, as well as herbivore type and intensity,
   when developing strategies to manage grazing by livestock, and feral and
   native herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{Policy makers and practitioners are in need of useful tools and models
   for assessing ecosystem service outcomes and the potential risks and
   opportunities of ecosystem management options. We utilize a
   state-and-transition model framework integrating dynamic soil and
   vegetation properties to examine multiple ecosystem services
   specifically agricultural production, biodiversity and habitat, and soil
   health across human created vegetation states in a managed oak woodland
   landscape in a Mediterranean climate. We found clear tradeoffs and
   synergies in management outcomes. Grassland states maximized
   agricultural productivity at a loss of soil health, biodiversity, and
   other ecosystem services. Synergies existed among multiple ecosystem
   services in savanna and woodland states with significantly larger
   nutrient pools, more diversity and native plant richness, and less
   invasive species. This integrative approach can be adapted to a
   diversity of working landscapes to provide useful information for
   science-based ecosystem service valuations, conservation decision
   making, and management effectiveness assessments.}},

Abstract = {{Spanish rangelands are considered to be of high nature value and a
   habitat of interest in the European Union due to their productivity and
   species diversity. However, they are fragile landscapes where farmers'
   decisions, such as changes in livestock pressure, can lead to serious
   deterioration. Currently, no indicator system is being used in these
   areas to enable farmers to evaluate the condition of rangeland soils.
   Aiming at this, soil properties, land degradation processes, rainfall
   characteristics, as well as pasture and land management were analysed in
   order to propose a set of soil quality and degradation indicators. The
   study was carried out on 22 enclosures selected from 10 privately-owned
   farms distributed throughout the Spanish region of Extremadura. Cation
   exchange capacity, available potassium, soil organic matter, water
   content at field capacity, soil depth and the thickness of the
   Ah-horizon were selected as soil quality indicators, with the percentage
   of bare ground cover and bulk density measured from 5 to 10 cm in depth
   selected as soil degradation indicators. All the indicators were
   classified into 5 categories and land units were assessed accordingly.
   The results revealed that 14\% of cases showed very low soil quality and
   18\% high degradation. The reasons that motivated the selection and
   categorisation of each indicator are described and the proposed system
   is compared with other existing indicator systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In recent years, a broad stakeholder base within the agricultural sector
   and among the public has become aware of the critical importance of
   healthy soils, spurred by public awareness campaigns and workshops. As
   we continue to grapple with a changing climate and more extreme weather
   events, regenerating the health and proper functioning of our nation's,
   and indeed world's, soil resource will markedly improve the capacity of
   soil to maintain or increase yield and yield stability, lower input
   costs, and contribute to other ecosystem services. This is true not only
   for croplands but also for pastures and native rangelands, orchards, and
   forests. To aid in moving forward initiatives to help farmers and
   ranchers improve the soil resource base, the USDA Natural Resources
   Conservation Service (NRCS) has created a new Soil Health Division
   (SHD). Personnel distributed across the country will facilitate soil
   health technical training and education for stakeholders, work with
   partners to standardize soil health assessments, promote soil health
   management systems as part of the conservation planning process, and
   facilitate implementation and long-term adoption of soil health
   management systems on our nation's agricultural lands. The new division
   will leverage skills, resources, technology, and partnerships to achieve
   these goals.}},

Abstract = {{Soil survey organizes the landscape into units with common soil
   properties, characteristics, and classification. Soil survey units can
   be used to predict soil behavior and thus are useful for making
   management decisions and evaluating soil change. Traditionally, in the
   USA, soil survey mapping concepts have been developed with the dominant
   use of the landscape in mind. Current enhancement of soil survey
   includes documenting dynamic soil properties and soil change due to
   ecosystem management. Ecological sites are a concept used to describe
   ``kinds of land{''} that have common potential kinds and amounts of
   vegetation and characteristic response to disturbance. In intensively
   managed (agronomic) systems, inputs (e.g., energy, fertilizer,
   irrigation water) can confound and homogenize vegetation indicators. In
   these situations, ecological site concepts, as constructed through state
   and transition models, can be differentiated based upon levels of soil
   function (indicated by dynamic soil properties) that occur as a result
   of the management (disturbance). Groupings and interpreting soil
   properties using an ecological site framework can serve as a useful tool
   for soil resource management and assessment and bring whole ecosystem
   insight into management decisions. Such organizational frameworks should
   provide information about both reference conditions and alternative
   management systems of soil functions or dynamic soil properties within
   an ecological site. Reference conditions might reflect either native or
   naturalized vegetation or the highest possible function that an
   ecological site could support. A framework for assessing soil condition
   in two ecological sites/soil types is examined. The capacity of each
   ecological site is different as indicated by soil carbon content and
   aggregate stability. This information allows for documentation of soil
   change (from reference to alternative states or management systems); it
   could also be used as a reference for soil health assessments and could
   be used to enhance soil survey with land use and management-specific
   information.}},

Abstract = {{The Fitzroy River (Central Queensland) has the second largest
   ocean-flowing catchment in Australia and retains relatively extensive
   remnant woodlands. However, clearing of the more fertile alluvial plains
   is proportionally much greater. Typically, forested habitat on the
   alluvial plain is restricted to narrow riparian corridors and small
   remnants on the adjacent terraces. Riparian forests are known to be
   important repositories of biodiversity in cleared and uncleared
   landscapes. However, little is known about the invertebrates of these
   habitats. Termites are ecosystem engineers promoting soil health and
   organic decomposition, and keystone taxa by virtue of mound and nest
   construction, and the hollowing of living trees. A comparison of the
   termite fauna of riparian forests and vegetation of the adjacent
   terraces (either remnant woodlands or cleared for grass-dominated
   pastures) was made at five locations in the Fitzroy River basin. Terrace
   pastures had fewer species than terrace woodlands while termite
   encounters within the riparian forests were lowest. Termite assemblages
   also differed between the three vegetation types. Some species showed
   zonation patterns. These patterns may relate to ecosystem drivers such
   as frequency of flooding in relation to life history parameters (e.g.
   arboreal or ground nesting). Termite species distribution also appeared
   to be coupled to resource availability such as presence of live and dead
   wood and percentage cover of litter, grass and dung. To retain natural
   levels of termite diversity and functionality, it is recommended that
   land managers retain both riparian forests and adjacent woodlands in a
   matrix with cleared pastures.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, livestock contributes 40\% to agricultural gross domestic
   product (GDP), employs more than 1 billion people and creates
   livelihoods for more than 1 billion poor. From a nutritional standpoint,
   livestock contributes about 30\% of the protein in human diets globally
   and more than 50\% in developed countries. Aqua culture accounts for
   nearly 50\% of global seafood production and employs more than 100
   million people. As outlined in the livestock revolution scenario,
   consumption of animalsourced food (ASF) will increase substantially,
   particularly in the so-called developing countries in response to
   urbanization and rising incomes, offering opportunities and income for
   smallholder producers and even the landless, thereby providing pathways
   out of poverty. It is important to recognize that the increasing demand
   for ASF pertains to ruminants (meat and milk), monogastrics (broilers,
   eggs and pork) and aquatic animals such as fish. To put it differently,
   much more animal feed will be needed for all domestic livestock and
   farmed aquatic animals in the future. Competition for feed among
   livestock and fish species will increase, in addition to competition
   with human food production and biomass needs for biofuels and soil
   health, unless we see significant levels of intensification of ASF
   production, and in ways that are environmentally sustainable. Animal
   source food production globally already faces increasing pressure
   because of negative environmental implications, particularly because of
   greenhouse gas emissions. As livestock and aquaculture are important
   sources of livelihood, it is necessary to find suitable solutions to
   convert these industries into economically viable enterprises, while
   reducing the ill effects of global warming. In relation to climate
   change, ASFs will have to play a dual role: one of mitigation and the
   other of adaptation.
   The most evident and important effects of climate change on livestock
   production will be mediated through changes in feed resources. The main
   pathways in which climate change can affect the availability of feed
   resources for livestock - land-use and - systems changes, changes in the
   primary productivity of crops, forages and rangelands, changes in
   species composition and changes in the quality of plant material - will
   be discussed in the chapter. The chapter will propose an environmentally
   friendly development of livestock production systems, where increased
   production will be met by increased efficiency of production and not
   through increased animal numbers. For aquaculture,the focus will be on
   better sourcing of feedstuffs and on-farm feed management. Feeding
   strategies that increase the efficiency of production by producing more
   from fewer livestock animals and less feed will result in reduced
   greenhouse gas emissions. This will be demonstrated by analysing
   livestock populations in India and their respective level of
   productivity. Thus, in India in 2005/06, the daily milk yield of
   cross-bred, local cows and buffalo averaged 3.61 l, resulting in a ratio
   of feed metabolizable energy (ME) for maintenance and production of 2.2
   to 1. By increasing daily milk production in a herd model (of a mixed
   cross-bred, local cow, buff alo population) from 3.61 to 15 l day(-1),
   energy expended for maintenance becomes 1:1.91. As a result, the same
   amount of milk can be produced by fewer livestock, leading to a
   reduction in emissions of methane of more than 1 million tonne (Mt)
   year(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is a valuable crop worldwide. In addition
   to use as forage, the nitrogen fixation capabilities of root nodules
   make it a valuable component in maintaining soil health. Unfortunately,
   the semi-arid region of the Northern Great Plains introduces a number of
   environmental stresses that are detrimental to stand establishment and
   persistence. This study aimed to identify alfalfa populations possessing
   the ability to produce adventitious shoots from root segments. The
   ability to produce adventitious shoots from roots is generally
   considered a favorable trait for increasing stress resistance. Seven
   Plant Introductions (PIs), selected from the National Plant Germplasm
   System, and one commercial cultivar (Persist II) as a control, were
   evaluated. Two six- centimeter root segments, originating at one and
   seven centimeters below the cotyledonary node, were cut from one year
   old plants. Root segments were planted in Miracle-Gro (R) potting soil,
   and cultivated under greenhouse conditions for 16 weeks. Adventitious
   shoot emergence was recorded throughout the experimental period. At the
   end of the experimental period, the number of adventitious shoots, shoot
   survival, flowering status, and non-shoot-bearing root segment decay
   were determined. Six of the seven PIs produced adventitious shoots. No
   shoots were produced by Persist II and PI494662. Among the six
   populations, the frequency of generating adventitious shoots ranged from
   3.8\% to 57\%. Shoot survival ranged from 33\% to 100\%. Speed of
   regeneration from roots and viability of root segments in soil varied
   among populations. PI631678 had the greatest frequency and speed of
   regeneration from roots, as well as high survival and flowering rates.
   Adventitious shoot regeneration and survival was not affected by origin
   distance below the cotyledonary node within in the same populations.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of grazing management on total soil organic carbon (SOC)
   and soil total nitrogen (TN) in tropical grasslands is an issue of
   considerable ecological and economic interest. Here we have used linear
   mixed models to investigate the effect of grazing management on stocks
   of SOC and TN in the top 0.5 m of the soil profile. The study site was a
   long-term pasture utilization experiment, 26 years after the experiment
   was established for sheep grazing on native Mitchell grass (Astrebla
   spp.) pasture in northern Australia. The pasture utilization rates were
   between 0\% (exclosure) and 80\%, assessed visually. We found that a
   significant amount of TN had been lost from the top 0.1 m of the soil
   profile as a result of grazing,. with 80\% pasture utilization resulting
   in a loss of 84 kg ha(-1) over the 26-year period. There was no
   significant effect of pasture utilization rate on TN when greater soil
   depths were considered. There was no significant effect of pasture
   utilization rate on stocks of SOC and soil particulate organic carbon
   (POC), or the C:N ratio at any depth; however, visual trends in the data
   suggested some agreement with the literature, whereby increased grazing
   pressure appeared to: (i) decrease SOC and POC stocks; and, (ii)
   increase the C:N ratio. Overall, the statistical power of the study was
   limited, and future research would benefit from a more comprehensive
   sampling scheme. Previous studies at the site have found that a pasture
   utilization rate of 30\% is sustainable for grazing production on
   Mitchell grass; however, given our results, we conclude that N inputs
   (possibly through management of native N-2-fixing pasture legumes)
   should be made for long-term Maintenance of soil health, and pasture
   productivity, within this ecosystem. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published
