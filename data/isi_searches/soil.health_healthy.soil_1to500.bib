Abstract = {{Two long-term field trials in South Australia were used to detect and
   characterise changes in soil biological properties that were a
   consequence of different agricultural management. The properties
   examined were total bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes; total
   pseudomonads; cellulolytic bacteria and fungi; mycorrhizal fungi; plant
   root pathogens (Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, Rhizoctonia
   solani, Pythium irregulare); bacterial-feeding protozoa; soil mesofauna
   (collembola and acari); earthworms; microbial biomass; C and N
   mineralisation; in situ CO2 respiration; cellulose decomposition; acid
   soil enzyme activity (peptidase, phosphatase, sulfatase). The
   sensitivity of these biological properties was assessed to tillage
   (no-tillage v. conventional cultivation), stubble management (stubble
   retained v. stubble harvested), crop rotation (continuous wheat v.
   wheat-sown pasture), and N fertilisation (nil v. 80 kg N/ha applied
   during the crop phase). Tillage, stubble management, crop relation, and
   N fertilisation significantly (P<0.01) affected C mineralisation and
   microbial biomass. Tillage with stubble management significantly
   affected root pathogenic fungi, protozoa, collembola, earthworms, and
   cellulose decomposition. Crop rotation affected mycorrhizal fungi,
   protozoa, and soil peptidase activity, and N fertiliser had a
   significant effect on mycorrhizal fungi, protozoa, and cellulose
   decomposition. As these biological properties are responsive to
   agricultural management, they may have potential as bioindicators. Total
   bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes, cellulose-decomposing bacteria and
   fungi, soil phosphatase and sulfatase activity, and N mineralisation
   were less affected by these treatments and may therefore have limited
   potential as bioindicators.}},

Abstract = {{Rice-wheat rotation is practised on about 23 million hectares of land
   mainly in China, India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh, with the two
   crops mostly meeting the food needs of Asian countries. But this
   rotation, besides having several advantages, has implications for soil
   health and the environment. Yields are very low (less than 5 t/ha) in
   some areas while quite high yields (8 t/ha) are obtained in south China
   and in the north western states of India. This variation is due to
   differences in infrastructure development and adoption of technology.
   This paper discusses constraints to the system in north-western India.
   The trends in area and productivity suggest that rice-wheat rotation
   will stay. However, there is a need to increase efficiency in the use of
   energy, nutrients and water, and to manage soil physical problems and
   restrict insects and pests effectively. This paper reviews these issues
   and the adoption level of technology. This can facilitate the transfer
   of technology to similar areas in other parts of the Indo-Gangetic
   Plains. The researchable issues are also listed.}},

Abstract = {{Bulk density of the Ap horizon is dynamic with respect to time and land
   use and therefore multiple field measurements are necessary to
   characterize it. Researchers often need a bulk density value to use in
   models, characterize field conditions, or convert gravimetric to
   volumetric measurements. A method is described to predict the field bulk
   density of the Ap horizon by measurement of the bulk density in the
   laboratory. The bulk density value measured with this method is
   independent of the use and temporal dynamics of the tillage zone. The
   method involves four treatments that have application in predicting bulk
   density values irrespective of the soil condition when sampled were
   tested. The treatments are: (1) capillary wetting and desorption at 33
   kPa suction; (2) capillary wetting, inundation, air drying, rewetting by
   capillary action, and desorption at 33 kPa suction; (3) Treatment 2
   followed by oven drying; (4) standard mechanical compaction at various
   water contents to obtain the Proctor density. Bulk densities for
   Treatments 1-3 were similar for soils with coefficient of linear
   extensibility less than 0.01. Bulk densities for Treatment 3 were
   similar to interpretive values used by the USDA-SCS and values predicted
   from Gupta and Larson's (Soil Sci. Sec. Am. J., 43: 758-764, 1979)
   packing model. Bulk densities for Treatment 2 are similar to field
   measurements. Comparison of bulk densities for Treatment 2 and field
   measurements provide an evaluation of soil health.}},

Abstract = {{Injudicious use of irrigation water due to increased irrigation
   facilities in some rice-wheat growing regions of northwest India has
   created the problems of irrigation-induced soil salinity and
   waterlogging. Apart from disturbing the healthy agri-ecological balance,
   these soil hazards deteriorate the soil health and fertility status of
   the soil resulting in low agricultural production, farm income and
   consequent reduction in farm labour employment. The present study of the
   Western Jamuna Canal and Bhakra Canal in Haryana (a north-western Indian
   state) based on a sample of 248 respondents, attempts to assess the
   effect of irrigation-induced soil salinity acid waterlogging on farm
   production, income and employment. The study observed a huge cut in
   non-land resource use on problem (salt-affected) soils as compared to
   normal soils, which consequently resulted in low farm production and
   income. Employment opportunities were also greatly reduced on problem
   soils.}},

Abstract = {{Recolonization of soils by organisms is dependent not only on biological
   factors but also on site factors including soil and vegetation. The
   total nematode populations in soil sterilized 52 months earlier with
   methyl bromide ranged from 77 to 123\% of those in untreated soil; both
   vegetation and rainfall appear to have been important factors in the
   recolonization. In a high-rainfall pasture the dominant plant-feeding
   nematode Helicotylenchus did not recolonize and was replaced by
   Paratylenchus. Under high rainfall, Iotonchus failed to recolonize
   either pasture or forest, but Clarkus recolonized well. While indices
   such as the maturity index, the summed maturity index, PPI, the ratio of
   fungal: bacterial feeding nematodes, species richness, the
   Shannon-Weaver index, and indices of evenness, dominance, and diversity
   showed various effects, none gave consistent trends; rainfall and
   vegetation probably exerted too much influence. In the light of trends
   in our data, in data for other ecosystems, and the reality of r-K
   strategies in animals, it may not be reasonable to expect a global
   `'nematode index'' of `'soil health'' or ecosystem condition. While a
   `'nematode index'' may be useful in local or regional studies, research
   efforts may be better directed towards elucidating `'key populations''
   of nematodes for investigating the impact of particular land management
   practices on ecosystem sustainability.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{The `'Old Rotation'' cotton experiment was designed to aid farm managers
   in implementing rotation schemes that not only increase yield, but also
   improve soil quality. Six different crop rotation treatments were
   imposed since 1896. Rotations were: IA, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)
   grown every year without a winter legume and without N fertilization;
   IB, cotton grown every year with a winter legume and without N
   fertilization; IC, cotton grown every year without a winter legume and
   with 134 kg N as NH4NO3 ha(-1) year(-1); IIA, 2-year cotton-corn (Zea
   mays L.) rotation with a winter legume and without N fertilization; IIB,
   2-year cotton-corn rotation with a winter legume and with 134 kg N
   ha(-1) year(-1) as NH4NO3; and III, 3-year cotton-corn- (alternating
   soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.] or rye (Secale cereale L.) rotation
   with a winter legume and with 134 g N as NH4NO3 ha(-1) year(-1). Crimson
   clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) was the winter legume cover crop. The
   2-year cotton-corn rotation with a winter legume and with 134 kg N
   ha(-1) year(-1) (IIB) and the 3-year cotton-corn soybean/rye rotation
   with a winter legume and with 134 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (III) had higher
   amounts of soil organic matter, soil microbial biomass C and crop yield
   than the other four treatments. The cotton grown every year without a
   winter legume or N fertilizer (IA) had a lower amount of soil organic
   matter, soil microbial biomass C and N and cotton seed yield than all
   other rotations. In 1988 and 1992 cotton seed and legume yield were
   correlated in positive, curvilinear relationships with soil organic
   matter (r(2) ranged from 0.72 to 0.87). In most months, soil microbial
   biomass C and N was lower in the cotton grown every year without winter
   legumes or fertilizer (IA) than the other five rotations. In 1994,
   microbial biomass C and the C-mic:C-org ratio correlated in positive,
   curvilinear relationships with seed cotton yield (r(2)=0.87 and 0.98,
   respectively). After 99 years of management the `'Old Rotation'' cotton
   experiment indicates that winter legumes increase amounts of both C and
   N in soil, which ultimately contribute to higher cotton yields.
   Microbial biomass C and the CmicCorg ratio are poor predictors of annual
   crop yield but may be an accurate indicator of soil health and a good
   predictor of long-term crop yield.}},

Abstract = {{Current production systems for flower bulbs in the Netherlands employ
   considerable quantities of pesticides and nutrients per unit area. In
   1993, an association of growers and environmentalists set out to design
   new farming systems that meet environmental objectives in addition to
   economic objectives. To support the design process, an explorative study
   was carried out to bring together the fragmented agronomic information
   and to assess agrotechnical options for sustainable flower bulb
   production with a time horizon of 10 to 15 years. Crop and inter-crop
   management systems representing the agro-technical components of
   sustainability at the farm level, were generated with a computer model
   by systematically varying four system characteristics, three of which
   represented strategic and tactical aspects of crop protection.
   Subjective components, one economic and two environmental objectives and
   various socio-economic constraints, were identified in interaction with
   the stakeholders. Interactive multiple goal linear programming was used
   to optimize the objectives at the farm level and determine the exchange
   value of the economic objective in terms of the environmental
   objectives. Calculations were carried out for two reference farm types.
   The results revealed that the negative impact of environment-oriented
   production systems on farm gross margin is importantly mitigated by
   strategic choices at the farm level, such as renting land and allowing a
   soil health improving crop, even though of low gross margin, into the
   rotation. In contrast, the a priori attention of the growers was focused
   on improving tactical pest and nutrient management at the crop level,
   the effect of which on farm gross margin is constrained by the strategic
   choices. Sensitivity analyses highlighted the need for more insight into
   the ecology of soil-borne growth reducing factors and their effect on
   crop yield. The paper describes the approach used, reports results and
   discusses the usefulness of the approach for the stakeholders and for
   disciplinary crop protection research.}},

Abstract = {{Australian farmers are searching for reliable, easily measured
   indicators of soil health to monitor sustainability of their
   enterprises. Over the past 5 years earthworms have been promoted as
   indicators of soil health by some researchers. Others have been
   reluctant to accept soil macrofauna in general as soil health
   indicators. Their reluctance is based on the difficulty of interpreting
   biological data in relation to soil health as there is no clear
   understanding of the links between soil macrofauna and soil health. The
   problem is further compounded by the inherent difficulty in studying
   soil biota, inadequate experimental design, and the lack of long-term
   commitment to funding such studies. This paper reflects on current
   research, and maps out conditions and directions for future research if
   the role of soil macrofauna in soil health is to be better understood.
   The compilation of adequate baseline data, the appropriate delineation
   of experimental plots, attention to the totality of environmental
   conditions including land management practices, the consideration of
   impact by macrofauna other than earthworms, are some of the directions
   are outlined. The challenge in the future will be to shift the emphasis
   of soil macrofauna research towards understanding their function in soil
   processes essential to ecosystem functioning. Without this sort of
   experimental evidence scientists cannot indicate to the farmer whether
   the soil resource is declining in quality, is stable or in a process of
   renewal based on the presence or absence of certain macrofauna. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Over exploitation of groundwaters to meet the water requirements for
   rice-wheat system is causing both fall in groundwater levels and their
   duality deteriorations in semi-arid parts of India. Adoption of
   rice-wheat cropping system by the farmers using poor quality (sodic)
   waters for irrigation may adversely affect soil health and thereby
   reduce crop yield. Adoption of irrigation schedule coupled with optimum
   nitrogen doses call be advantageous for sustaining yield of rice in
   these areas. Strategics for optimum use of these inputs has to be based
   on the knowledge of soil-water-nutrient-plant interactions evolved
   through field studies. In order to develop such relations, studies
   involving several combinations of irrigation levels and nitrogen doses
   were conducted on rice crop at Kaithal (India) and their effect on
   biomass, yield, water and nitrogen use efficiency were studied during
   1993 and 1994.
   Irrigation schedules were based on the period of submergence ranging
   from 0 to 6 days. The nitrogen doses varied from 0 to 180 kg ha(-1) The
   average rainfall during the seasons was 51 cm. Both irrigation and
   nitrogen had positive effect on yield which increased from 1729 kg
   ha(-1) ( continuous submergence without fertilizer) to 4522 kg ha(-1)
   (irrigation at 3 days disappearance of water with ISO kg N ha(-1)). Ther
   were large variations in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) depending oil the
   dose of N and applied water. At 60 kg N ha(-1). NUE varied from 35.4 to
   40.9 kg ha(-1) grain per kg of N. Further increase in the dose of N upto
   180 kg ha(-1) however resulted in decline in NUE. Nitrogen and
   irrigation had positive influence oil applied water efficiency (AWE).
   Under continuous submerged conditions, the beneficial effect of N on AWE
   was observed only upto 120 kg ha(-1). But at lower levels of irrigation
   (3 and 6 days disappearance of water). these effects continued even upto
   180 kg ha(-1). The results of this study indicated that there is
   possibility to use the sodic water (upto RSC of 8 mcq/l) for growing
   rice crop provided the crop is irrigated with appropriate irrigation
   scheduling with the higher dose or N under conditions of > 50 cm monsoon
   rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{The relative abundance of entomopathogenic nematodes and fungi was
   estimated for 10 sites in each of indigenous forest, pasture, and
   cropland habitats by baiting soil samples with Galleria larvae. The
   steinernematid Steinernema feltiae (Filip) was the dominant nematode,
   occurring in soils from all three habitat types. The heterorhabditid
   Heterorhabditis zelandica Poinar was recovered only from soils of
   podocarp (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides (A. Rich.)) forests. Galleria
   infection by nematodes was higher in soils from forest habitat than in
   soils from pasture and cropland. Among the sampled forests, nematode
   infection was higher in soils from podocarp stands than those from
   broadleaf stands. The deuteromycete fungi Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo)
   Vuillemin, Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin, and
   Paecilomyces cf. cicadae (Miquel) Samson, and a Entomophthorales
   zygomycete, tentatively identified as a Tarchium species, were recovered
   from the Galleria baits. Infection of Galleria by B. bassiana and M.
   anisopliae occurred in soils from all habitat types, while that by P.
   cicadae occurred only in soils from forest habitats. Tarchium was
   recovered from a single pasture site. The frequency of Galleria
   infection by these entomopathogenic fungi collectively, and by B.
   bassiana alone, was higher in pasture soils than in soils from either
   forest or cropland. These results are discussed in relation to
   disturbance effects of land use changes and the potential role of
   generalist entomopathogens as biological indicators of soil health.}},

Abstract = {{Pesticides have long been used for pest control in countries throughout
   the world. Although the exact number and the amount of pesticides used
   are not clear, hundreds of different compounds are in use. For example.
   PESKEM 95, a database of registered pesticides in Australia, shows that
   there are more than 1100 pesticide products containing about 300
   different active ingredients available for use. Such increasing reliance
   on pesticides for pest control has led to considerable degradation of
   soil and surface and groundwater quality in many developed and
   developing countries throughout the world. The lucrative export markets
   for produce have resulted in a marked escalation in agrochemical use for
   pest control in several of these countries. Pesticides can have a number
   of adverse impacts on the crop, soil, and water environment. These
   include their (i) impact on crop quality, (ii) impact on soil health,
   and (iii) potential to leach and contaminate surface and groundwater,
   especially in irrigated areas and in regions of high precipitation. All
   of these impacts arise from the biochemical and physical interactions
   between the applied pesticides and soil particles. Contamination of the
   environment by pesticide residues arises mainly from their application.
   Pesticide residues have been detected at the point of application in the
   field, as a result of spray drifts from aerial spraying. run-off from
   rain, drainage water from irrigated areas and in groundwater at selected
   sites throughout the world. Although much research has bean conducted on
   the impact of pesticides in soil and water environments in the temperate
   region there is a dearth of information on the dynamics of pesticides in
   the soils of tropical regions. Humid tropical climatic conditions and
   agricultural practices may play a dominant role in controlling the fate
   and behaviour of pesticides in tropical field ecosystem. Consequently,
   the effect of such soil and climatic conditions on soil health and
   soil-plant transfer of pesticide may differ from that observed under
   temperate soil conditions. In this paper we focus on the dynamics of
   pesticides in soils under tropical climates and implications for
   ecotoxicological effect and availability to plants. Emphasis will be
   placed on the chemistry of soils in relation to pesticide
   adsorption-desorption behaviour controlling pesticide availability in
   soils.}},

Abstract = {{Field experiments were conducted in villages around the National Capital
   Power Project, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh and LARI Farm, New Delhi to
   evaluate the effects of flyash incorporation on soil properties and the
   growth and yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), mustard (Brassica
   juncea L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.) and maize (Zea mays L.). Flyash
   application levels (up to 50 t/ha) were decided on the basis of an
   ash/dust fall range of 5-12 t/ha/y in villages adjoining the thermal
   power station. The grain yield of maize increased in flyash-treated
   plots with the addition of ash up to a maximum addition of 10 t/ha.
   Dusting crop canopies with ash decreased the yield in proportion to the
   amount applied. The yield of wheat increased up to an addition of ash of
   20 t/ha, and declined thereafter, but was still higher than the yield
   when no flyash as added. Paddy yield when 10 t/ha of ash was added was
   similar to that with no flyash, whereas mustard showed improvements in
   seed yield with flyash addition at 10 t/ha level. Flyash-treated plots
   had a marginally higher uptake of Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn and Cd. Flyash addition
   to soil resulted in lower bulk density, although the differences
   compared with non-treated plots were not significant. The addition of
   flyash also reduced the hydraulic conductivity and improved moisture
   retention at field capacity and wilting point, but no changes in
   available water were observed. These changes in soil properties might
   have been due to modifications in macro- and micro-pore size
   distribution and which may also have contributed to the increased crop
   yields in light- and medium-textured soils. However, the effects of ash
   addition on soil health and crop productivity need to be established
   with long-term studies. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted during June 1993-February 1994 to study the

   and post-milk stages resulted in higher rice grain productivity and
   profitability. Considering soil health and increase in P fertilizer
   price, the farmer may choose to apply P at 50\% of recommended dose (19
   kg P2O5/ha) with 2\% DAP spray twice at boot-leaf stage and 50\%
   flowering or at post-milk stage if capital is constraint for the farmer.
   Based on the previous season result, test verification trial was
   conducted in the winter (rabi) season with `IR 20' rice as test variety.
   Similar trend was also observed in the test verification trial. The

Abstract = {{A recently published rangeland health assessment guide for arid
   shrublands of the Karoo, South Africa, addresses the problem of apathy
   toward rangeland. The guide is designed for land users with a minimal
   knowledge of plants and soil processes. More than 200 colour
   photographs, maps and diagrams introduce the rancher to the processes
   that maintain soil fertility and range productivity. Topics covered
   include soil formation, cryptogam crusts, water acquisition and storage
   by plants, plant population renewal and vegetation change. Then using
   subjective five-point scores, the guide assesses rangeland health by
   vegetation cover, forage value, utilization intensity, plant demography
   and soil health and protection. This hands-on, non-technical approach to
   range assessment is intended to avert rangeland damage by making the
   rancher more aware of the natural resources on which ranching depends.
   Ranchers who spend time in their rangelands and well understand the
   dynamics of plant populations in response to rainfall patterns and
   grazing are generally more successful than ranchers with little interest
   in their rangeland. A similar approach, combining subjective assessment
   of soil and vegetation, could be designed for ranchers in other arid and
   semi-arid regions subject to desertification through misunderstanding
   and inadvertent mismanagement. (C)1998 Academic Press Limited.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental or land quality indicators are being developed
   internationally as a means whereby the `State of the Environment' (SoE)
   can be assessed and trends monitored. In Australia, the use of
   indicators in SoE reporting is in its early stages of development.
   Indicators have been developed, in relation to agriculture, for flora
   and fauna, soil, chemical contamination, surface waters and groundwater.
   Internationally, the World Bank has listed `indicators of pressure' on
   the land, `indicators of state and impact: and `indicators of response'
   for each of seven major issues of land degradation. Late in 1996, an
   `indicators of catchment health' workshop in Australia identified a
   relatively small number of key indicators relating to farm productivity,
   soil health, water quality and `landscape integrity: later adding social
   indicators, and also distinguishing between indicators at farm and
   catchment scales. A broad range of other indicators was also considered
   by various participants in the workshop, which concluded by supporting a
   nationally co-ordinated effort and the establishment of a national
   steering committee. Although most indicators are static measures, those
   from which predictions can be made require a greater emphasis on the
   functioning of the system. This implies that indicators are only one
   aspect of system modelling, and that environmental or land assessment
   needs to progress further than the search for quality indicators. Since
   this involves both biophysical and human processes, geographers should
   be playing a central role.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of N fertilization, wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) stubble burning, and organic amendments on the
   density of downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) seed in soil of a winter
   wheat-fallow crop rotation. The site was part of a long-term study that
   has been conducted since 1931 near Pendleton, OR. The study consists of
   a winter wheat-fallow crop rotation with both a fallow and cropped
   portion of each treatment present each year. The objective of the
   original long-term study was to document changes over time in soil
   physical and chemical properties due to the addition of inorganic and
   organic sources of N fertilizer, and repeated burning of crop residues.
   A weed seedbank component was added to this study in 1992. To measure
   effects on the weed seedbank, soil samples were taken in the fall after
   winter wheat harvest and after winter wheat planting in the fallow and
   cropped portions, respectively, from 1992 through 1994. From these
   samples downy brome seed content was analyzed using a sieving-flotation
   seed extraction technique. Long-term use of inorganic N fertilizer
   increased the downy brome seedbank compared with an unfertilized
   control. Crop residue burning reduced the downy brome seedbank and downy
   brome plants in the wheat crop. Addition of steer manure or green pea
   {[}Pisum sativum (L.) subsp. sativum] vines as an N source did not
   increase downy brome in the seedbank compared with use of inorganic N
   fertilizer. This was, perhaps, due to factors such as improved soil
   health resulting from use of organic soil amendments, or differences in
   application timing or source of inorganic and organic N fertilizer The
   organic form of N from manure may have been applied at a more opportune
   time for winter wheat than for downy brome, In addition, plots receiving
   steer manure produced a higher yielding wheat crop that was likely to be
   more competitive against downy brome, thereby limiting seed production.}},

Abstract = {{Tillage systems impact soil biota involved in the decomposition of
   stubble and the biota, in turn, is responsible for the transformation of
   nutrients that are essential to fertility. Modifications in soil
   microbial populations could be indicative of alterations in the soil
   health caused by different management practices. The purpose of this
   work was to quantify the aerobic cellulolytic population as a sensitive
   indicator of the changes caused by stubble placement in three tillage
   systems: chisel (ChT), no-till (NT) and fall plow followed by NT
   (FP-NT), and at two depths (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm). The study was conducted
   on a Chernozemic clay loam soil (Vertic Argiudoll) during 1994-1996, in
   a corn (Zea mays L.)-double crop wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-soybean
   (Glycine max (L.) Merr.)-soybean rotation sequence. Samples were taken
   after wheat harvest. Dilution series of soil suspensions were inoculated
   in selective medium for cellulolytics and counts were done by most
   probable number (MPN). Crop residue was separated from soil by sieving
   and dry weight determined. No-till showed the largest number of aerobic
   cellulolytics in 1995 and 1996 compared to the other tillages (p less
   than or equal to 0.05). In respect to soil depth, NT showed a greater
   concentration of cellulolytics in the 0-5 cm depth. We did not find
   differences between tillages in the total amount of residue, but there
   were differences in its distribution, with residue concentrations in the
   NT soil, being 2.5 times higher at the 0-5 cm than at 5-10 cm soil
   layer. The dynamics of cellulolytic population indicated sensitivity to
   stubble placement. It may be possible to use it together with other
   properties as an indicator of changes due to management practices. (C)

Pages = {{4-10}},
Abstract = {{Disease suppressiveness can be viewed as one of the characteristics of a
   healthy soil. From an ecological point of view, soil health implies
   ecosystem stability, diversity, functional connectedness, and resilience
   in response to a disturbance or stress; Disease suppression can be
   Viewed as a manifestation of ecosystem stability and health. Previously
   suggested indicators for soil health and disease suppression have mainly
   been lists of variables that were correlated to more or less disturbed
   soils (ranging from conventional and organic agricultural soils, to
   grassland and forest soils) or to root disease conduciveness. We suggest
   that indicators for soil health and disease suppression could be found
   by monitoring responses of the soil microbial community and nutrient
   availability to the application of a disturbance or stress. This
   approach is illustrated by wave-like responses of microbial communities,
   soluble carbon and nitrogen, and damping-off by Pythium spp. after
   incorporation of a cover crop in soil. The amplitudes of the waves were
   mostly wider when cover crop debris was incorporated in fallow soil than
   in cover cropped soil. Pythium damping-off was less severe in
   cover-cropped soil. These results suggest that the proposed approach to
   the search for indicators of soil health and disease suppression, namely
   measuring the amplitude of fluctuations in microbial populations and
   resilience to a disturbance or stress, is promising.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability of forest and rangeland ecosystems is intricately linked
   with healthy and productive soils. Soils vary widely in their quality.
   Their health is a condition of the soil relative to their inherent
   quality and ability to perform vital soil and ecosystem functions. Soils
   in Pacific Northwest forest and rangeland ecosystems are particularly
   heterogeneous. For example, selected soils from six Ecoregions, have
   organic carbon contents that range from about 40,000 to more than
   800,000 kg/ha. Total nitrogen content ranges from less than 2,000 to
   more than 50,000 kg/ha.
   There is a close relationship between soil quality and health and
   ecosystem quality and health. Ecosystem stresses can be increased by
   management activities that compact soils and alter soil moisture and
   nutrient status and processes. Forest health in Inland Western forests
   is intricately linked with carbon and nutrient cycling. A high
   percentage of soil organisms make their home in the soil and play a
   critical role in the functions of ecosystems. Alteration of soil
   physical and nutrient conditions can alter the incidence of soil borne
   diseases which, in turn, affect the health of ecosystems.
   Specific quantitative soil standards, or thresholds, are needed to
   determine detrimental conditions. The National Forests have established
   a variety of measures of detrimental conditions. A variety of physical
   measures, such as bulk density changes, displacement and erosion, and
   detrimental burn conditions are emphasized.
   Soils vary widely in their resiliency, or ability to rebound from
   impacts. A model of soil resiliency adopted from Szabolcs (1994),
   includes physical, chemical and biological buffering and pedological and
   anthropological soil fluxes. Several soils from six Pacific Northwest
   Ecoregions are rated for their resiliency. Criteria for chemical,
   biological and physical buffering is included.}},

Abstract = {{Over-exploitation of groundwaters to meet the water requirements for
   rice-wheat systems is causing both a fall in groundwater levels and
   their quality deterioration in semi-arid parts of India. Adoption of
   rice-wheat cropping systems by the farmers using poor quality (sodic)
   waters for irrigation may adversely affect soil health and thereby
   reduce crop yield. Adoption of an irrigation schedule coupled with
   optimum nitrogen doses can be advantageous for sustaining yields of rice
   in these areas. Strategies for optimum use of these inputs has to be
   based on the knowledge of soil-water-nutrient-plant interactions evolved
   through field studies. In order to develop such relations, studies
   involving several combinations of irrigation levels and nitrogen doses
   were conducted on rice crops at Kaithal (India), and their effect on
   biomass, yield water and nitrogen use efficiency (NUB) were studied
   during 1993 and 1994. Irrigation schedules were based on the period of
   submergence ranging from 0 to 6 days. The nitrogen doses varied from 0
   to 180 kg ha(-1). Both irrigation and nitrogen had a positive effect on
   yield, which increased from 1729 kg ha(-1) (continuous submergence
   without fertilizer) to 4522 kg ha(-1) (irrigation at 3 days
   disappearance of water with 180 kg N ha(-1). At 60 kg N ha(-1), NUE
   varied from 35.4 to 40.9 kg ha(-1) grain per kg of N. Further increase
   in the dose of N upto 180 kg ha(-1) however resulted in a decline in
   NUE. Nitrogen and irrigation had a positive influence on applied water
   efficiency (AWE). Under continuous submerged conditions, the beneficial
   effect of N on AWE was observed only up to 120 kg ha(-1). But at lower
   levels of irrigation (3 and 6 days disappearance of water), these
   effects continued even up to 180 kg ha(-1). The results of this study
   indicated that there is a possibility of using the sodic water (up to
   residual sodium carbonate {[}RSC] of 8 meq/l) for growing rice provided
   the crop is irrigated with an appropriate irrigation scheduling with the
   higher dose of N under conditions of > 50 cm monsoon rainfall. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The aim of this review is to present a foundation of present knowledge
   and to describe existing strategies for the development and
   implementation of monitoring systems for soil quality of arable land,
   based on soil-quality indicators. In the review viewpoints are discussed
   on the soil-quality concept, suggested frameworks for its assessment,
   and possible methods for the selection and evaluation of quality
   indicators. These sections are in general terms, without emphasis on
   chemical, physical or biological soil properties. The potential value of
   including microbiological indicators in a monitoring system is discussed
   thoroughly. Several possible microbiological indicators are suggested,
   and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Strategies for the
   selection and sampling of monitoring sites are reviewed, and the
   treatment of samples before analyses is also discussed. In conclusion, a
   framework for using microbiological indicators in a Swedish monitoring
   system is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of sowing lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) strips in irrigated
   cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fields on soil quality was evaluated in a
   Vertisol at the Australian Cotton Research Institute (ACRI), and in a
   Vertisol and an Alfisol at two on-farm sites in New South Wales,
   Australia, from December 1995 to February 1997. Chemical (pH, EC, CEC,
   exchangeable sodium percentage, organic C), physical (air-filled
   porosity, plastic limit, dispersion index, soil strength), and
   biological (earthworm activity) indicators of soil quality were measured
   in each site. Overall soil quality in cotton and lucerne strips was
   evaluated using a `soil health condition report card' format to award a
   score to each soil quality indicator and summing up the individual
   scores to give a single value for each crop at any one site. The
   decision to award a particular score to any one indicator was based on a
   value range derived from the Literature. In comparison with cotton,
   lucerne strips had higher air-filled porosity and organic C in the
   sub-soil of both on-farm sites, but had no significant effect at ACRI.
   However, lucerne did result in higher organic C in the soil surface at
   ACRI. Soil strength was higher and EC lower within lucerne strips in all
   three sites. Sowing lucerne strips resulted in higher earthworm activity
   at ACRI and at one commercial site, with highest numbers of earthworm
   burrows being observed in the former. We suggest that this has affected
   liquid flow patterns at ACRI where preferential flow mediated via the
   earthworm burrows appears to dominate. Overall soil quality was improved
   by lucerne strips only at ACRI, whereas that in the on-farm sites was
   not affected. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion of forests to intensive agriculture often leads to
   degradation of weathered soils. The effects of two intensities of
   vegetation management on soil beta-glucosidase (beta-GLC) and
   phosphomonoesterase (PME) activities were studied on two river-terrace
   soils of differing fertility in Costa Rica. After approximately four
   years of annual harvest or continuous vegetation removal to bare soil,
   soil organic matter carbon (SOM-C), microbial biomass carbon (Mb-C),
   beta-GLC and PME activity were reduced. Effects of continuous cropping
   to bare soil on Mb-C, beta-GLC and PME were greater in the more
   weathered, acidic, Al-rich, P-limited upper-terrace soil than in the
   more neutral, base cation-rich lower-terrace soil. In contrast, more
   SOM-C was lost in the lower terrace. The annual harvest treatment
   produced intermediate decreases in SOM-C, Mb-C, beta-GLC and PME on
   upper-terrace soils, intermediate reduction in lower terrace beta-GLC,
   and no significant effect on lower terrace Mb-C or PME. beta-GLC
   activity was the most sensitive indicator of treatment effect and may be
   a suitable alternative to Mb-C or SOM-C as a measure of change in soil
   health. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{TerraPy (R) is an innovative soil and plant revitalizer produced
   entirely from natural renewable raw materials. The product stimulates
   microorganism activity in the soil and promotes growth of
   plant-beneficial microorganism, such as mycorrhiza fungi. In
   agriculture, the strength of TerraPy (R) can be seen in revitalizing
   soil health, especially where intensive cultivation has disturbed the
   biological balance in the soil ecosystem and high numbers of plant
   pathogens have build up. One of the major factors limiting plant growth
   in poor soil are plant-parasitic nematodes. The following studies were
   conducted to measure the effect of TerraPy (R) against the root-knot
   nematode Meloidogyne incognita. TerraPy (R) was applied at 2 kg/ha, 20
   kg/ha and 200 kg/ha as a soil drench 3 weeks after planting and 2 days
   before inoculation with the root-knot nematode M. incognita. When the
   experiment was terminated after 8 weeks the gall index of all 3
   application rates of TerraPy (R) was significantly lower than in the
   nematode-infested control. The 3 application rates did not differ
   significantly. Nevertheless, the highest application rate of TerraPy (R)
   also showed the lowest gall index. A significant increase in plant
   growth was observed for TerraPy (R) applied at 200 kg/ha. In vitro
   studies revealed that TerraPy (R) had no direct effect on M. incognita
   activity, an important requirement for plant growth promoting agents
   when it comes to registration. When TerraPy (R) was applied at 20 kg/ha
   in combination with 0.2\% mycorrhiza substrate (w/w), an additional
   reduction in nematode infestation was achieved. This results clearly
   demonstrated the beneficial effects of TerraPy (R) on plant growth and
   health, which was evident even at low application rates of 2 kg/ha.}},

   observed in comparison to beushening (Beushening is cross ploughing in
   standing water under lowland rice ecosystems when rice plants are
   approximately 45 days old) without fertilizer and green manure treatment
   - which is the farmers' practice in this coastal region, It is also

Abstract = {{Modern agriculture is exploitive of growth resources and has caused
   various problems such as a environmental pollution through (a)
   contamination of underground drinking water resources, food and fodder
   with pesticides and nitrates, which is harmful to farm workers and
   livestock, (b) poor soil health leading to low soil productivity and (c)
   poor quality of life. These problems may be overcome with the adoption
   of Ecological Agricultural practices. The definition of Ecological
   Agriculture used in this chapter is ``Ecological Agriculture consists of
   those practices, which reduces the use of outside inputs on farm.
   Therefore, various types of allelopathic strategies may be used for (a)
   maintenance of soil fertility (use of crop rotations, BNF, crop
   mixtures, crop residues and leaf litter etc.), (b) weed management
   (cover crops, crop residues as mulches, intercropping, crop rotations,
   phytotoxic or allelopathic varieties and natural herbicides etc.), (c)
   insects pests management (cropping systems, resistant varieties,
   insecticidal allelochemicals etc.), (d) nematodes management (plant
   materials, oilseed cakes, nematicidal compounds etc.), (e) diseases
   management (cropping systems, crop residues, organic amendments etc.)
   and (f) allelochemicals as growth regulators. Therefore, research
   efforts are needed to utilise inhibitory allelopathic effects of plants
   for natural control of crop pests and diseases, so that use of present
   pesticides could be minimised for keeping the environment clean for our
   future generations.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the arid and semi-arid
   regions of the country has faced the challenge of alkalinity/salinity
   problems associated with soils and irrigation waters. One of the major
   problems confronting present day agriculture is decreasing availability
   of good quality irrigation water. With increasing demand and decreasing
   availability of good quality waters, there is growing tendency among the
   farmers to use these poor quality waters for crop production.
   Indiscriminate use of poor quality waters in the absence of proper
   soil-water-crop management practices poses grave risks to soil health
   and environment. In India about 36 percent of irrigated lands have been
   damaged at different levels due to such practices. This disappointing
   picture due to faulty irrigation development. Failure to create
   ``enabling condition{''}, lack of institutional support, lack of
   provision of drainage, all contributed to failure to prevent the growing
   problem of water logging and salinity. Area under canal irrigation
   during the last three decades was only 19 percent but area increase
   through tubewells has been of the order of 160 and 189 percent in
   Haryana and Punjab, respectively. The scenario on ground water
   utilisation is not the same in several other states or their specific
   areas disadvantaged either with poor quality aquifer yields or their
   quality. Surveys rate 32-84 per cent of the presently operable wells of
   different states to be of poor quality.
   A number of technological options are available (like improve water
   management practices through sprinkler, drip irrigation etc (ii)
   conjunctive use of ground water where quality is poor, (iii) skimming
   well/doruvu technology where shallow ground water management is needed
   and (iv) subsurface drainage (SS D) where water table is high and
   quality of ground water is poor) to augment the effective supply of
   land. Though these options are crucial, they have themselves tended to
   be centralized and technocratic and hence capital intensive. For such
   reason, each of these prescribed strategies/remedies enjoyed the status
   of a `privileged solution' at one time or other. There was no effort to
   harness the synergic benefits of those options, with the result that no
   progress was achieved in testing these strategies together. It does not
   stimulate testing and modification and does not promote a `learning
   process' strategy. This paper mainly suggests different policy options
   and strategic approaches like institutional intervention through
   participatory approaches from technical mode to participatory mode,
   group incentives, price policy for different water saving devices and
   clear cut ownership right for sustaining crop production in saline
   environments of India.}},

Abstract = {{Prince Edward Island (PEI) has a land area of 575,000 hectares and its
   landscape is undulating. About half the land is cleared, the other half
   under natural forest. The long term effect of intensive farming
   practices on soil health is becoming a matter of concern as it is felt
   that soil quality may deteriorate through continuous agrichemical inputs
   and loss of productive topsoil through erosion. This study was
   established to: set up a process to measure soil quality, establish soil
   quality indicators, measure soil quality on an on-going basis and report
   results to the public. The sampling locations were selected on a 4 km x
   4 km grid across PEI. A total of 232 agricultural sampling locations
   were selected and located by GPS (Global Positioning System). A cluster
   of up to five samples was taken at each location, depending on land use.
   One sample will be taken at the selected GPS coordinates and the other
   four, 100 metres due south, north, west and east respectively. In the
   232 sampling locations selected, the actual number of samples taken will
   be 796. One third of the sampling locations are being sampled each year,
   starting in 1998. Three groups of parameters are being measured:
   Physical Parameters (depth of A and B horizons soil type, length and
   degree of slope, position of sample on slope, crops grown, crop rotation
   and type of tillage), Chemical Parameters (Organic Matter, Total Carbon,
   pH, Phosphorus, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Boron, Zinc, Sulfur,
   Manganese, Iron, Sodium, CEC, and Base Saturation), Microbial Parameters
   (microscopic observation, enzyme assays). The analyses of the collected
   data focuses on determining the existence of statistically significant
   relationships among the measured variables. The methods to be applied
   include logistic and linear regression, examination of correlations, as
   well as methods specifically designed for spatial or geographic data.
   GIS (Geographical Information System) maps of PEI are being be developed
   to show patterns of the various parameters measured. As data collection
   proceeds over time, time series methods or longitudinal methods of
   regression will also be employed to determine if the relationships or
   associations observed in the initial data hold up over time. This
   project will provide information to policy makers, researchers and the
   general pubic about Prince Edward Island current soil quality and the
   trends in soil quality over time.}},

Abstract = {{The creation of favourable conditions beneficial for biomass production
   is only one of several functions that soil fulfils. Polyfunctional
   approach to the soil assessment is unified in a term soil quality or
   soil health. In our opinion soil quality is expressing soil capability
   to secure soil ecological functions at its concrete utilization manner.
   Decisive soil functions, from the view of formation environmental
   stability and subsequently life quality are following soil functions:
   biomass production, filtering and accumulation function, transforming
   function, sanitation function, buffering function, biological habitat
   and gene reserve. When evaluating soil duality, two main goals are
   distinguished: mutual comparison of soil quality at different soil
   representatives for potential soil price derivation, and soil quality
   changes monitoring or its parameters, namely in direction of soil
   degradation.
   Individual ecological function on the level of soil types is
   orientationally evaluated in range 0 to 100 points. Soil quality is
   subsequently expressed as an average of the values obtained for the soil
   functions, whereby each of the functions has equal position. Soil value
   and subsequently price practical application, based on ecological soil
   function evaluation, is primarily visible in the case of permanent
   seizure of soil first of all for infrastructure development, building of
   refuse dumps and mining of raw-materials.}},

Abstract = {{The thin layer of soil on the earth's surface performs many functions
   essential to life. Humankind has known of the importance of this
   resource for thousands of years, but formal study of soils began only in
   the 1800s using knowledge acquired in the basic sciences of physics,
   chemistry, and biology. During the mid-1800s, much of the infrastructure
   for soil science was put into place. Land-grant universities and
   experiment stations were established, and funding mechanisms for
   conducting research were created. In the early 1900s, as the number of
   scientists grew and the level of research activity increased,
   professional societies were formed, and scholarly journals began
   publication. Research efforts during this time concentrated on
   understanding water movement and nutrient availability largely as it
   applied to crop production. As a consequence of natural and human
   aggravated disasters, such as the American dust bowl in the 1930s,
   management practices were developed to reduce wind and water erosion and
   conserve the soil resource. In the 1960s, environmental awareness grew,
   and research efforts were directed at understanding the processes
   involved in environmental contamination, development of management
   practices to reduce the potential for environmental contamination, and
   procedures to remediate contaminated sites. Soils research has
   accomplished much, providing us with a thorough understanding of the
   physical, chemical, and biological properties and processes of soils,
   determining the role of sons in environmental quality, and developing
   the management practices used to produce a bountiful food supply.
   However, despite these accomplishments and continued demands for
   soils-related information, soil scientists are currently facing many
   challenges. A steady supply of inexpensive, high quality food produced
   by less than 2\% of a largely urban population has left the majority of
   people with Little appreciation of the problems and challenges facing
   agriculture. Competing interests for budget dollars have left funding
   for agricultural research level or in decline in recent years. In
   addition, the current crisis in agriculture has resulted in a lower
   market share than ever before being returned to farmers, leaving
   producers with little incentive or flexibility to change management
   practices. Soil scientists must work with these challenges to ensure
   that the science is available to address critical problems facing
   society, namely: population pressure and the need for increasing
   agricultural productivity; competing uses for land and water resources;
   dependence on nonrenewable resources; and environmental quality,
   especially in developing countries. Facing current challenges and
   solving future problems will likely require that soil scientists conduct
   research differently than in the past, with greater emphasis on holistic
   team- and interdisciplinary analyses of problem areas, followed by
   reductionist disciplinary research that ensures optimal use of research
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{Natural stands of spruce cover extensive areas of Serbia. They are
   especially well conserved in the Kopaonik and Tara National Parks and
   also over other mountainous massifs: Golija, Stara Planina and Zlatar.
   Along with natural stands, spruce has been widespread by afforestation
   at different sites. They differ very much by means of conservation,
   quality, health, age and tending. In large areas, in natural and
   artificial stands, spruce is endangered by Fomes annosus. The
   productivity (ecological potential) is great, while at mountainous and
   alpine sites of the Kopaonik National Park, it is almost unbelievable,
   reaching a volume of above 800 m(3)/ha and volume increment of about 30
   m(3)/ha. On the majority of sites, there are stands that can be
   considered as significant for the protection of the biodiversity of
   forest communities in Europe. In the Kopaonik National Park, there are
   specimens reaching 150 cm in diameter, more than 50 m high, representing
   monuments of nature of planetary significance. For the evolution of acid
   brown soils on granodiorites of Kopaonik and for the reduction of
   acidity and the increase of biogeny, the spread of mountain ash (Sorbus
   aucuparia) is very important.
   The problems of planning measures for forest enhancement are numerous
   and some of them are difficult to solve. They depend on forest origin,
   stocking, physical and chemical properties of the soil, health, weeds,
   and the adverse consequences of man's impact.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed the effect of eight lime application rates, with
   four field replications, on the activities of 14 enzymes involved in C,
   N, P, and S cycling in soils. The enzymes were assayed at their optimal
   pH values. The soil used was a Kenyon loam located at the Northeast
   Research Center in Nashua, Iowa. Lime was applied in 1984 at rates
   ranging from 0 to 17,920 kg effective calcium carbonate equivalent
   (ha(-1)), and surface samples (0-15 cm) were taken after 7 years.
   Results showed that organic C and N were not significantly affected by
   lime application, whereas the soil pH was increased from 4.9 to 6.9. The
   activities of the following enzymes were assayed: alpha- and
   beta-glucosidases, alpha- and beta-galactosidases, amidase, arylamidase,
   urease, L-glutaminase, L-asparaginase, L-aspartase, acid and alkaline
   phosphatases, phosphodiesterase, and arylsulfatase. With the exception
   of acid phosphatase, which was significantly (P < 0.001) but negatively
   correlated with soil pH (r = -0.69), the activities of all the other
   enzymes were significantly (P < 0.001)and positively correlated with
   soil pH, with r values ranging from 0.53 for the activity of
   alpha-galactosidase to 0.89 for alkaline phosphatase and
   phosphodiesterase. The Delta activity/Delta pH values ranged from 4.4 to
   38.5 for the activities of the glycosidases, from 1.0 to 107 for
   amidohydrolases and arylamidase, 97 for alkaline phosphatase, 39.4 for
   phosphodiesterase, and 11.2 for arylsulfatase. This value for acid
   phosphatase was -35.0. The results support the view that soil pH is an
   important indicator of soil health and quality.}},

Abstract = {{The disposal of industrial effluents is a problem of increasing
   importance throughout the world. In India, a huge amount of waste water
   generated from distillery and paper industries is discharged on land or
   into the running water. Distillery waste water is characterized by low
   pH, high BOD and COD values and contains a high percentage of organic
   and inorganic materials. This waste water also contains considerable
   amounts of elements like N, P, K, Ca and S. The paper mill effluents are
   characterized by high values of BOD, COD and wide range of pH, depending
   upon the source of origin. The N, P and K contents are lower as compared
   to those in distillery waste waters. Impact of use of these effluents on
   soil, plant and waterbodies is discussed. Use of distillery effluents
   indicates a significant increase in electrical conductivity (EC),
   organic carbon, exchangeable Na as well as available N, P and K in
   soils. Similarly, pH, organic carbon, cation-exchange capacity,
   available N, P, K and micronutrient contents of soils irrigated with
   paper factory effluents are reported to be increased. Besides, the use
   of this waste water increases the exchangeable Na content of soils. Some
   of the field crops show positive response to post-methanation effluent
   application with irrigation water. Paper mill effluents are found to
   adversely affect the seed germination and seedling growth of various
   crops, whereas, these aspects of crops are stimulated due to the
   application of these effluents after proper dilution. Increase in
   organic load, depletion of oxygen content and destruction of aquatic
   life in water course are some of the major problems created due to
   disposal of these effluents in river. Methods of control and treatment
   of these effluents are indicated. Manurial potential, strategies and
   constraints of utilization of these industrial effluents in agriculture
   are mentioned.}},

Abstract = {{In most studies of fungal-bacterial communities in soils, single-value
   indices such as fumigation-extraction (FE) of microbe-derived organic
   carbon, measures of specific microbial cell chemical constituents, or
   activity-related measures have been used. These widely used single value
   indices, however, do not provide information on the physical structure
   of the filamentous fungal and bacterial community in a soil. The
   filamentous fungi, considered as indeterminate organisms, have a
   variable and changing hyphal network, most of which is devoid of
   cytoplasm. To meet this need for a direct integrated measure of the
   physical characteristics of the indeterminate fungi and their associated
   bacteria, a microscopy-based microbial biovolumes ratios approach is
   suggested. To provide this information, the total and active biovolumes
   of both the filamentous fungi and bacteria are assessed by microscopy.
   To normalize these responses, the ratio of total to active (TA) fungal
   plus bacterial biovolumes is divided by the ratio of the active fungal
   to bacterial biovolume (AFB), to yield the total/active/active
   fungal/bacterial (TA/AFB) biovolumes ratio. This approach has been used
   to analyze data from recently-cultivated early successional (ES) and
   uncultivated late successional (LS) sites at a shortgrass steppe of
   northeastern Colorado, where control plots were compared with those
   receiving mineral nitrogen amendments, using samples taken during the
   summer of 1995. The TA/AFB ratio index showed distinct and significant
   decreases in response to soil disturbance which reflected the decreased
   hyphal lengths present in these disturbed soils. These changes were not
   detected by the use of FE-based extractable carbon measurements. The
   TA/AFB ratio also showed significant positive correlations with indices
   of plant community development and mineral nitrogen, especially in the
   plots not amended with N. This TA/AFB ratios index should be able to
   provide information on the physical structure of the indeterminate
   filamentous fungi and associated soil bacteria for use in the assessment
   of soil quality, health and resiliency. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Land productivity, along with improvement or maintenance of soil health,
   must be evaluated together to achieve sustainable agricultural
   practices. Winter wheat-fallow (W-F) has been the prevalent cropping
   system in the central Great Plains for 60 years where moisture is a
   limitation to crop production. Alternative cropping systems show that
   producers can crop more frequently if residue management and minimum
   tillage are used. The impact of different crops, crop rotations and
   tillage management practices on soil quality was assessed by measuring
   aggregate stability and glomalin production by arbuscular mycorrhizal
   (AM) fungi in soil from cropping trials established in 1990. Crops were
   wheat (W), corn (C), prose millet (M), and sunflower (S). Rotations
   sampled were W-F, W-C-M, W-C-M-F, W-C-F, and W-S-F. In the same area as
   the cropping trials, soils were taken from a perennial grass (crested
   wheatgrass) and from a buffer area that had been planted to Triticale
   for the past 2 years but prior to that had been extensively plowed for
   weed control. We found that aggregate stability and glomalin were
   linearly correlated (r=0.73, n=54, P<0.001) across all treatments
   sampled. Highest and lowest aggregate stability and glomalin values were
   seen in perennial grass and Triticale soils, respectively. Aggregate
   stability in W-S-F was significantly lower than in the other crop
   rotations (P less than or equal to 0.03), while W-C-M had significantly
   higher glomalin than the other rotations (P<0.05). Differences between
   crop rotations and the perennial grass indicate that selected
   comparisons should be studied in greater detail to determine ways to
   manage AM fungi to increase glomalin and aggregate stability in these
   soils.}},

Abstract = {{A huge amount of effluents generated from tanning and textile industries
   is being discharged on land or into water courses. These effluents are
   characterized by high BOD, GOD, Na and total dissolved solids. These
   effluents also contain several major primary and secondary plant
   nutrients (N, P, K, S, Mg, Ca, etc.) as well as micronutrients and heavy
   metals. Addition of tannery effluents is reported to cause
   deflocculation of soil particles and increase in the N, P and K levels
   of soils. Similarly, deleterious effects, such as increase in pH,
   sodicity and EC in soils due to the use of textile effluents are
   reported. However, it is pointed out that the adverse effects of these
   effluents get progressively reduced with dilution of effluents. But
   database is not adequate to indicate the effect of long-term use of
   these effluents on soil health. The impact of the use of these effluents
   on various crops, trees and shrubs as well as water bodies is discussed.
   Salinisation and alkalisation of ground water due to application of
   these effluents are also reported. The physicochemical characteristics
   of these effluents do not permit its disposal directly into inland water
   or on land for irrigation, hence, several methods of treating these
   effluents for safe disposal are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural doses of heptachlor 20EC (16.25 lit/ha) and endosulfan 35EC
   (2.5 lit/ha) produced quick knockdown effect on 4 different nontarget
   soil microarthropod species under microcosm conditions. Short term
   direct toxicity decreased sharply with subagricultural dilutions but
   Cyphoderus javanus (Collembola) suffered considerable mortality even at
   10,000 times dilution of the recommended agricultural dose of endosulfan
   35EC. Both C. javanus and Archegozetes longisetosus (Cryptostigmata)
   were sensitive to heptachlor 20EC upto 300 times dilution of;he
   agricultural dose. Sublethal toxicity of both pesticides on the
   reproductive behaviour was evident from reduced fecundity of all the 4
   species investigated including highly sclerotised cryptostigmatid mites
   namely Lancetoppia confusaria and Scheloribates albialatus. Chronic
   toxicity of endosulfan at 12,000 times dilution and heptachlor at 2,000
   times dilution of the agricultural doses significantly reduced the
   fecundity of C. javanus whereas statistically significant reduction in
   the fecundity of A. longisetosus was observed only at 500 ad 1000 times
   dilution of endosulfan and heptachlor, respectively. Even short duration
   exposure to pesticide treated soil reduced the fecundity of C. javanus.
   This reproductive sensitivity can be proposed as a potential
   ecotoxicological tool for pesticide residue detection and soil health
   assessment in agroecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive vegetable farming has the potential to damage soil health,
   leading to poor productivity and large environmental impacts. This paper
   reports on changes in soil properties after three and a half years of
   vegetable cropping and discusses the implications for sustainability. A
   vegetable fanning-systems experiment began in 1992 at Somersby, in NSW,
   Australia. The aim of the experiment was to compare five different
   approaches to vegetable cropping in terms of their productivity,
   profitability, soil effects and environmental impact. The experimental
   treatments represent whole production systems, intended to simulate real
   farms, but under more controlled conditions than is possible on farms.
   The systems are defined by the goals and values of the farmer rather
   than by the management practices employed. The actual management
   practices - nutrition, tillage, rotations, pest and weed management,
   etc. - were selected to satisfy these goals and values. For instance, to
   satisfy the goal of `maximise profit', fertilisers and pesticides were
   applied in excess to ensure high yields of large, undamaged produce
   which receive the best prices. Conversely, one of the management
   practices used to satisfy the goal `optimise profit while minimising
   environmental impact' was to grow cover crops regularly in rotation with
   vegetable crops. A range of chemical, physical and biological properties
   of surface soil (0-10 cm) from the farming-systems were measured and
   compared to baseline measurements. The two alternative systems, which
   received large inputs of compost, had higher soil organic carbon,
   microbial biomass. total nitrogen, total phosphorus, exchangeable
   nutrient cations, water-holding capacity and aggregate stability than
   the conventional systems. The system that received the largest mineral
   fertiliser inputs, and the most tillage, had the highest available
   phosphorus levels, the lowest phosphorus sorption capacity and lower
   aggregate stability than the alternative systems. Consequently this high
   input system had the greatest potential to lose sediments and phosphorus
   to the environment. The two other conventional systems had smaller
   fertiliser inputs and maintained a phosphorus sorption capacity that was
   no different from the alternative systems. These more carefully managed
   conventional systems offer hope that relatively small changes in
   management can have significant environmental benefits. Yet the broad
   improvement in soil health achieved by the biological approaches should
   provide better long-term fertility and lower off-site impacts. It may be
   wise to make use of both these approaches to management in attempting to
   balance the short and long-term viability of intensive vegetable
   farming. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil health is the capacity of soil to function as a vital living
   system, within ecosystem and land-use boundaries, to sustain plant and
   animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and
   promote plant and animal health. Anthropogenic reductions in soil
   health, and of individual components of soil quality, are a pressing
   ecological concern. A conference entitled `Soil Health: Managing the
   Biological Component of Soil Quality' was held was held in the USA in
   November 1998 to help increase awareness of the importance and utility
   of soil organisms as indicators of soil quality and determinants of soil
   health. To evaluate sustainability of agricultural practices, assessment
   of soil health using various indicators of soil quality is needed. Soil
   organism and biotic parameters (e.g, abundance, diversity, food web
   structure, or community stability) meet most of the five criteria for
   useful indicators of soil quality. Soil organisms respond sensitively to
   land management practices and climate. They are well correlated with
   beneficial soil and ecosystem functions including water storage,
   decomposition and nutrient cycling, detoxification of toxicants, and
   suppression of noxious and pathogenic organisms. Soil organisms also
   illustrate the chain of cause and effect that links land management
   decisions to ultimate productivity and health of plants and animals.
   Indicators must be comprehensible and useful to land managers, who are
   the ultimate stewards of soil quality and soil health. Visible organisms
   such as earthworms, insects, and molds have historically met this
   criterion. Finally, indicators must be easy and inexpensive to measure,
   but the need for knowledge of taxonomy complicates the measurement of
   soil organisms. Several farmer-participatory programs for managing soil
   quality and health have incorporated abiotic and simple biotic
   indicators. The challenge for the future is to develop sustainable
   management systems which are the vanguard of soil health; soil quality
   indicators are merely a means towards this end. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{While soil quality encompasses physical and chemical besides biological
   characteristics, soil health is primarily an ecological characteristic.
   Ecosystem health has been defined in terms of ecosystem stability and
   resilience in response to a disturbance or stress. We therefore, suggest
   that indicators for soil health could be found by monitoring responses
   of the soil microbial community to the application of different stress
   factors at various intensities. The amplitude of a response and time to
   return to the current state before application of stress could serve as
   measures of soil health. Root pathogens are an integral part of soil
   microbial communities, and the occurrence of epiphytotics forms an
   indication of an ecosystem in distress. Disease suppression can be
   viewed as a manifestation of ecosystem stability and health. Thus,
   indicators for soil health could possibly also function as indicators
   for disease suppressiveness. Previously suggested indicators for soil
   health and disease suppression have mainly been lists of variables that
   were correlated to more or less disturbed soils (ranging from
   conventional to organic agricultural soils, grassland and forest soils)
   or to conduciveness to disease. We suggest a systematic ecological
   approach to the search for indicators for soil health and disease
   suppression, namely, measuring biological responses to various stress
   factors and the time needed to return to the current state. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Soil microorganisms play important roles in soil quality and plant
   productivity. The development of effective methods for studying the
   diversity, distribution, and behavior of microorganisms in soil habitats
   is essential for a broader understanding of soil health. Traditionally,
   the analysis of soil microbial communities has relied on culturing
   techniques using a variety of culture media designed to maximize the
   recovery of diverse microbial populations. However, only a small
   fraction (<0.1\%) of the soil microbial community has been accessible
   with this approach. To overcome these problems, other methods such as
   the analysis of phospholipid fatty acids and community-level
   physiological profiles have been utilized in an attempt to access a
   greater proportion of the soil microbial community. in recent years,
   molecular methods for soil microbial community analysis have provided a
   new understanding of the phylogenetic diversity of microbial communities
   in soil. Among the most useful of these methods are those in which small
   subunit rRNA genes are amplified from soil-extracted nucleic acids.
   Using these techniques, it is possible to characterize and study soil
   microbes that currently cannot be cultured. Microbial rRNA genes can be
   detected directly from soil samples and sequenced. These sequences can
   then be compared with those from other known microorganisms.
   Additionally, group- and taxon-specific oligonucleotide probes can be
   developed from these sequences making direct visualization of
   microorganisms in soil habitats possible. The use of these techniques
   provides new ways of assessing soil microbial diversity and ultimately,
   a more complete understanding of the potential impacts of environmental
   processes and human activities on responses of soil microorganisms.
   Information gained from such studies will have direct impacts on our
   understanding of the role of microbial processes in soil health. (C)

Abstract = {{Various cultural practices, including the use of cover and rotational
   crops, composts, tillage systems, and others have been promoted as
   management options for enhancing soil quality and health. All cultural
   practices are known to directly or indirectly affect populations of
   soilborne pathogens and the severity of their resultant root diseases.
   Soil biology is a major component and contributes significantly to soil
   quality and productivity. The major activities of soil microbes include
   the decomposition of organic materials, mineralization of nutrients,
   nitrogen fixation, suppression of crop pests and protection of roots,
   but also parasitism and injury to plants. Thus, there is a great need to
   assure that the introduced soil management practices to improve soil
   quality will also result and maintain a healthy soil. The latter include
   the abundance and diversity of total soil microbes, high population of
   beneficial organisms and low population and/or activities of crop pests.
   Production of vegetables and other food crops is often significantly
   affected by several soilborne pathogens that require control. The
   incidence and severity of root diseases is an indirect assessment of
   soil health for specific commodity/soil use. In addition, understanding
   and selecting the appropriate cultural practices that limit or prevent
   damage of root diseases is essential for the long-term and sustainable
   management of soil quality and health. Case-study examples are presented
   to illustrate the impact of cover crops and their green manures on the
   density and damage of root-knot and lesion nematodes to vegetables; and
   also tillage, soil amendments, crop rotation, and cover crops on bean
   yield and root rot severity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Mulch applied to tropical soil may increase soil health both through
   stimulation of microbiota beneficial to plant nutrient uptake and the
   suppression of plant disease. To test this hypothesis, we compared beans
   in three cropping systems: (1) mulched with secondary vegetation
   (slash/mulch), (2) mulched with foliage from alleycropped
   nitrogen-fixing trees, Calliandra calothyrsus, Gliricidia sepium and
   Inga edulis (alleycrop/mulch), and (3) unmulched, for their effect on
   positive microbial interactions (nodulation with Rhizobium and
   arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM)), and pathogenic associations (foliar and
   root diseases) in long-term field experiments in Costa Rica. In some dry
   years slash/mulched beans nodulated significantly mon than the
   unmulched, though in wet years the nodule biomass was not significantly
   different between treatments. Beans grown in alleycropping systems
   mulched with foliage from Calliandra and Inga had lower nodule biomass
   than beans in slash/mulched and Gliricidia mulched plots at 3 and 5
   weeks, probably due to high nitrogen levels from the decomposing
   vegetation of the tree mulch. Roots of bean plants were 95-98\%
   colonized by AM fungi and there were no differences between the
   slash/mulched beans and the unmulched treatments. Slash/mulch had no
   effect on the foliar diseases angular leaf spot and web blight, due to
   their naturally low incidence in that year; slash/mulched decreased the
   severity of anthracnose (caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum).
   Slash/mulch decreased severity of a Fusarium-type root rot, but
   increased a Rhizoctonia-type, In the laboratory, microbial activity as
   determined by measurements of CO2 respiration was greater in the
   slash/mulched than the unmulched system due to the high respiration of
   the mulch material. Our hypothesis that the use of mulch would favor
   mutualistic symbionts was not supported, which may be due to weather and
   nutrient interference. However, the hypothesis that mulch would reduce
   disease incidence was supported for certain diseases. A comparison of
   the microbial community with those of nearby natural systems can help
   provide a standard for the assessment of microbial health in
   agroecosystems and allow us to avoid the circularity of defining
   microbial communities as `healthy' because they are found in cropping
   systems whose plants appear without disease. (C) 2000 Published by

Abstract = {{Drawing on academic literature and personal experience, the authors
   highlight trends emerging from sustainable agriculture efforts in
   developing countries, involving research institutions, action agencies,
   and communities, to provide recommendations for advancing a soil health
   movement. They argue that multi-disciplinary and -institutional efforts
   on soil health that link research. practice, and political action will
   de needed for improved agriculture and more promising futures.
   During this century soil research has concentrated on soil chemical and
   physical factors, with comparative neglect of biological factors.
   Consequently, there is relatively limited understanding of how best to
   capitalize on the dynamics and potentials of soil biology so as to
   enhance the regenerative capacity of soil systems for agriculture. More
   agronomic research and empirical experience for biologically-based
   agriculture are called for.
   Although better understanding and practices can serve immediate on-farm
   needs, they alone would unlikely achieve the desirable changes in
   farming systems. Policies and institutional arrangements profoundly
   influence agricultural research and practice, so effective soil health
   initiatives must also engage broader social and political
   considerations. In particular, the author's argue for greater balance in
   research and teaching to emphasize biology and ecology, enhanced
   linkages between research and extension, new inter-institutional
   partnerships and collaboration, and increased stakeholder involvement in
   policy formulation and implementation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The first ever estimate of organic carbon (OC) stock in Indian soils was
   24.3 Pg (1 Pg = 10(15) g) based on 48 soil series taking into account of
   a few major soils. The present OC stock has been estimated as 63 Pg in
   the first 150 cm depth of soils. Soils with their geographical
   distribution through the country were used for computing soil organic
   carbon (SOC) stock in different depths in various physiographic regions.
   To sustain the quality and productivity of soils, the knowledge of OC in
   terms of its amount and quality in soils is essential. This has more
   relevance in soils of the tropical and subtropical parts of the globe,
   including the Indian sub-continent. SOC stock appears to be a single
   parameter that can help effectively in prioritizing the area for
   restoring soil health.}},

Abstract = {{Stability of a soil property to perturbation comprises both resistance
   and resilience. Resistance is defined as the ability of the soil to
   withstand the immediate effects of perturbation, and resilience the
   ability of the soil to recover from perturbation. Functional stability
   is used here to describe the stability of a biological function to
   perturbation, rather than the stability of physical structure or
   chemical properties. The function chosen for this study was the
   short-term decomposition of added plant residues, and the perturbations
   were copper and heat stresses. Previous studies had shown that
   functional stability was reduced greatly in soils with experimentally
   reduced biodiversity. The objective of this study was to determine the
   relative sensitivity of functional stability and potential indicators of
   biological status to detect alteration of held soils by various
   environmental impacts. Functional stability, protozoan populations and
   substrate mineralisation kinetics, were measured on paired soils with:
   high or low plant species diversity; hydrocarbon pollution or not;
   extensive or intensive agricultural management practices. Substrate
   mineralisation kinetics were poorly related to the soil's antecedent
   conditions and were stimulated significantly by hydrocarbon pollution.
   Protozoan populations were potentially useful for detecting differences
   within soil type, but will require greater taxonomic input to be most
   useful. Functional stability particularly resistance, was able to
   quantify differences between and within soils. The potential development
   of the technique in relation to soil health is discussed. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Over the last 10 years, considerable progress has been made in defining
   and assessing soil health and soil quality. However, problems still
   exist in the interpretation of soil quality indicators due to the
   complexity and interrelatedness of soil processes. Additionally, the
   crop production system selected by growers affects the potential for the
   adoption of practices promoting soil health. Factors influencing the
   selection of the crop production system include the marketing strategy
   adopted by the grower, the commodity value, the cultural practices and
   inputs used to grow the crop (e.g. fertilisers, pesticides, etc.). To
   date, growers have had little time to consider the impact of soil health
   on crop production. Plant pathology, however, and related disciplines
   have made major contributions to the understanding of soil health,
   particularly in the area of the identification and verification of
   disease-suppressive soils and the agents responsible for this
   suppression. The linkage of plant health to the functional diversity of
   biological communities in the soil has been far more elusive, but is
   rapidly becoming more important as consumers and markets push for
   environmental sustainability. To further progress our understanding of
   soil health and facilitate its application to production agriculture,
   plant pathologists should identify and focus on crop production systems
   that are amenable to showing a return on investment in soil health.}},

Abstract = {{Globally speaking, the world would require one billion metric tons of
   wheat in the year 2020 as compared to the current production of 600
   million metric tons. These figures, when translated into productivity
   parameters, mean that the current wheat global average yield of 2.5
   t/ha. must shift to roughly 4 t/ha, in the 2020. Can this be achieved?
   Optimistically speaking, this projection can be met provided there is
   continuous support and investment in agricultural science and research,
   especially in conventional plant breeding, integrated pest management
   including soil health, improved seed multiplication and distribution,
   system, optimum and efficient use of inputs. Furthermore, mechanization
   of farming systems and supporting pricing policies to farmers are
   necessary for continuing production increases. I believe that, an
   invigorated research program on redesigning of wheat plant, discovery
   and assembly of hybrid vigour, efficient management of water and
   drought, genetically superior system of uptake and translocation of
   nutrients, suitable germplasm adapted to conservation tillage practices,
   durable and multiple disease resistance in wheat and transgenics would
   insure a superior germplasm base from which future cultivars with high
   and stable yield potential would be made available to the farmers.
   Germplasm and genetic resources would remain paramount. However, every
   precaution is warranted to preserve the natural resource base and soil
   nutrient balance, so that the future agricultural system is guaranteed
   with minimum hazard to environment.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{114-117}},
Abstract = {{Background. The primary purpose of environmental assessment is to
   protect biological systems. Data collected over the last several decades
   indicates that the greatest impacts on biological resources derive from
   physical changes in land use. However, to date there is no consensus on
   indicators of land use that could be applicable worldwide at all scales.
   This has hampered the assessment of land use in the context of LCA.
   Objectives. The Institute for Environmental Research and Education and
   its partner Defenders of Wildlife have begun an effort to develop the
   necessary consensus.
   Methods. In July 2000, they held a workshop attended by a diverse group
   of interested parties and experts to develop a preliminary list of life
   cycle indicators for land use impacts
   Results. Their preliminary list of impact indicators includes:
   protection of priority habitats/species; soil characteristics: soil
   health; proximity to \& protection of high priority vegetative
   communities; interface between water and terrestrial habitats/buffer
   zones; assimilative capacity of water and land; hydrological function;
   percent coverage of invasive species within protected areas; road
   density; percent native-dominated vegetation; restoration of native
   vegetation; adoption of Best Management Practices linked to biodiversity
   objectives; distribution (patchiness; evenness, etc.); and connectivity
   of native habitat.
   Conclusion. The list of indicators conforms well to other efforts in
   developing indicators. There appears to be convergence among experts in
   the field and in related fields on the appropriate things to measure.
   Future Prospects. These indicators are currently being tested in the
   United States. Further workshops and testing is planned towards
   developing internationally recognized indicators for land use.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanisation of the Australian industry has contributed to its high
   efficiency but has also led to farming practices that optimise neither
   crop production nor the use of machinery. The current system contributes
   significantly to increasing soil compaction, declining soil health, poor
   weed control plus crop loss and stool damage during the harvest/haulout
   operation. It is time to redress these deficiencies by developing new
   farming systems. Recent research has shown that narrow row spacings
   significantly increase yields and can therefore provide the economic
   engine to drive the adoption of best practices in improved farming
   systems. A sequence of systems based on dual, triple and quadruple row
   spacings is proposed. These systems overcome the constraints of light
   and water interception, soil compaction and soil health, weed control,
   and water use efficiency, and avoid crop loss and stool damage during
   harvest. The two closer row spacings cannot be managed with current
   machinery; they require modifications to existing equipment or new
   multi-row equipment designed to suit the system. Consequently,
   evaluation and implementation of the new systems will involve the
   establishment of model farms by large growers and/or progressive
   plantings by cooperatives or groups of smaller growers to rationalise
   the cost and use of narrow row equipment.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In the wake of the public controversy over genetically modified crops,
   organic production is sometimes hailed as the true ``sustainable
   agriculture{''}. Its advocates claim that it enriches biodiversity,
   increases soil ``health{''} and provides more nutritious foods. This
   paper summarises the results of a three year; multi-disciplinary study
   of one major unit undergoing transition from non-organic to full organic
   status. Researchers examined whole farm nutrient budgets, insect
   diversity and the wider environmental economics of organic production
   compared with non-organic management. The result was a mid-term example
   of multi-disciplinary science, though some way short of
   interdisciplinary science. The evidence suggests that organic production
   can result in measurable environmental gains, which can be valued in
   economic terms. The full environmental account, however, remains
   elusive. Yet its significance could prove vital for the future of
   diversified rural economics in the UK. Interdisciplinary minded
   agricultural and environmental economists are encouraged to extend this
   pilot initiative in the light of the important policy contribution that
   such additional research could provide for the improved valuation of
   sustainable agriculture. The authors conclude that there is a plausible
   case for an Organic Stewardship Scheme attached to the Rural Development
   Regulation.}},

Abstract = {{The prospect of using wastewater containing high loads of soluble
   organic matter (OM) for removing residual agricultural chemicals
   (fertilizer, pesticide, or herbicide) in farm soil, although promising,
   could have adverse effects on soil agricultural quality as a result of
   development of redoximorphic features in the soil profile. In this
   study, the effect of organic carbon supplement for bioremediation of
   residual fertilizer nitrate on soil properties, redox potential (Eh),
   pH, and metal ion mobilization was studied using sandy soils packed in
   columns. The study was included in a general project, described
   elsewhere (Ugwuegbu et al., 2000), undertaken to evaluate use of
   controlled water table management (WTM) systems to supply organic carbon
   for creating a reduced environment conducive to denitrification of
   residual fertilizer nitrate leaching from the farm to subsurface water.
   The columns were subjected to subirrigation with water containing
   soluble organic carbon in the form of glucose, The work was carried out
   in two experimental setups and the long-term effect of a range of
   glucose concentrations on the Eh, pH, and soluble levels of Fe and Mn
   was investigated. From the results obtained, it could be concluded that
   excessive organic carbon supplement to soil can have adverse effects on
   soil quality and that Eh and soluble Fe are the two most practical
   parameters for monitoring soil health during treatment of farm
   chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{Globally speaking, the world would require one billion metric tons of
   wheat in the year 2020 as compared to the current production of 600
   million metric tons. These figures when translated into productivity
   parameters, mean that the current wheat global average yield of 2.5
   t/ha. must shift to roughly 4 t/ha. in tile 2020. Can this be achieved?
   Optimistically speaking, this projection can be met provided there is
   continuous support and investment in agricultural science and research,
   especially in conventional plant breeding, integrated pest management
   including soil health, improved seed multiplication and distribution,
   system, optimum and efficient use of inputs. Furthermore, mechanization
   of farming systems and supporting pricing policies to farmers are
   necessary for continuing production increases.
   I believe that, in invigorated research program on redesigning of wheat
   plant, discovery and assemply of hybrid vigour, efficient management of
   water and drought, genetically superior system of uptake and
   translocation of nutrients, suitable germplasm adapted to conservation
   tillage practices, durable and multiple disease resistance in wheat and
   transgenics would insure a superior germplasm base from which future
   cultivars with high and stable yield potential would be made available
   to the farmers. Germplasm and genetic resources would remain paramount.
   However, every precaution is warranted to preserve the natural resource
   base and soil nutrient balance, so that the future agricultural system
   is guaranteed with minimum hazard to environment.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) and heavy metals introduced into soil by irrigating with
   sewage effluent can affect the soil's microflora and, in particular, the
   abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We have studied the effect in
   the Mezquital Valley of Mexico, on two kinds of soil Leptosol and
   Vertisol) after both short-term (5 years) and long-term (90 years)
   irrigation. We did so by replicated sampling of all four combinations of
   soil type and length of irrigation and then estimating the main effects
   and interactions by analysis of variance.
   Both kinds of soil appear to have accumulated large quantities of P and
   heavy metals as a result of the irrigation so that concentrations have
   approximately doubled and now approach the thresholds for healthy soil.
   The differences between soil types were comparatively small. Phosphorus
   was the only element for which there was an interaction between soil
   type and time under irrigation. The Leptosol contained more spores than
   the Vertisol, irrespective of the length of the irrigation, and both
   types contained significantly fewer spores after 90 years of irrigation
   than after only 5 years. The effect was more evident in Vertisols. Zn
   contrast, the sporocarpic morphotypes seemed unaffected by the
   accumulated phosphorus and metals. The sporocarps of Glomus mosseae were
   twice as abundant in the Leptosol as in the Vertisol, but those of
   Sclerocystis were equally prevalent in the two types of soil. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The effects of soil faunal activity on the physical properties of the
   soils of a 2-year-old fallow in the sahelian zone of Senegal were
   studied. Factors studied included the presence or absence of woody
   shrubs and the effect of protection of plots from grazing and removal of
   fuel wood. The experimental design included a control in which termite
   activity was excluded by treating the soil with the persistent
   insecticide dieldrin.
   In both the protected and unprotected area of the experiment, termite
   burrowing activity (as measured by the number of entrance holes per
   square-metre) and water infiltration rates were significantly (ca. 80\%)
   lower in termite exclusion plots than in plots not treated with
   insecticide 2 years after initial treatment. In protected plots where
   termites were present, there was a significant increase in infiltration
   rates in the part where woody shrubs were removed. In unprotected plots,
   by contrast, the presence of shrubs significantly increased infiltration
   rates, whether or not termites were present.
   Burrowing activity of earthworms was greater in the protected than in
   the unprotected area, and in the unprotected area burrowing in dieldrin
   treated plots was significantly increased by almost 65\%. Activity of
   ants appeared to be little affected by the different treatments. The
   results demonstrate that the presence of healthy soil faunal populations
   was important in the infiltration of water in fallow soils and that
   protection from grazing and human activity improves faunal activity and
   water infiltration. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The utilization of organic amendments for control of soil-borne plant
   pathogens has often been considered at best variable, but more often as
   a snake-oil remedy. Understanding the mode of action of these products,
   however, provides insight as to when and how to exploit these
   underutilized energy sources for the benefit of plant and soil health.
   Organic amendments containing high nitrogen, such as poultry manure,
   meat and bone meal, and soymeal, significantly reduced populations of a
   wide spectrum of soil-borne plant pathogens. Pathogen control was shown
   to arise from the ammonia and (or) nitrous acid generated, the
   concentrations of which are controlled by pH, organic matter content,
   soil buffering capacity, and nitrification rate. Swine manure can reduce
   pathogen populations by both these mechanisms as well as by an
   additional process involving volatile fatty acids. Volatile fatty acids
   are active only at pH conditions below 6.0 and were present in most, but
   not all liquid manures tested. Disease control with organic amendment
   occurs when soil and biological factors are conducive to activating the
   processes that reduce pathogen survival. Understanding the mechanisms
   allows prediction of efficacy based on analysis of the soil and the
   organic amendment. For some products, such as ammonium lignosulfonate, a
   by-product of the pulp and paper industry, disease control was
   demonstrated but the mode of action is as yet unclear. Although organic
   amendments reduce populations of plant pathogens, overall they lead to
   an increase in soil microorganisms populations by up to 1000-fold
   following application, Thus, the displacement of pathogens is selective
   and can persist in fields for several years after single application. As
   we unravel the potential benefits of organic treatments, there is
   indication that they may return as a valuable tool in disease management
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The role of vegetation and soil factors on the biodiversity of two soil
   dwelling, saprophagous, fly families (Sphaeroceridae and Lonchopteridae)
   in a heathland ecosystem were investigated. The fly community is
   primarily affected by soil humidity and the amount of organic matter
   while the vegetation structure and species composition only indirectly
   influence the fly communities. There was no correlation between plant
   species richness and the fly diversity indices. Based on our results and
   literature data, we hypothesise that the direct effects of the
   vegetation is more evident for herbivorous insects than for species that
   do not feed on plants. The investigated families show a clear response
   to microhabitat differences in the soil factors, which makes them
   promising indicators for soil health and as tool for monitoring

Abstract = {{The acute sensitivity to CuSO(4) of a broad range of nematode taxa was
   analyzed in order to assess the potential of changes to nematode
   community structure to serve as a practical tool for the bioindication
   of heavy-metal pollution. An easy-to-use experimental set-up was
   developed along with an appropriate mathematical response modal in order
   to quantify the response characteristics of nematodes to CuSO(4)
   pressure. Three similar experiments were conducted using water, dune
   sand, and sandy soil as media, each of which was subjected to 12
   increasing concentrations of CuSO(4). In total. 130 response curves
   representing 70 nematode taxa were produced and analyzed. CuSO(4)
   concentrations were normalized for differences in efficiency among media
   due to different adsorption. At low CuSO(4) concentrations, many taxa
   exhibited stimulation rather than inhibition regarding recovery
   efficiency. At higher concentrations, the concentration level at which
   50\% of the nematode population was recovered after a 24-h incubation
   (recovery concentration 50\% {[}RC50]) varied widely among taxa and
   ranged from 0.01 to 4 mM/L CuSO(4) (normalized to water). Stimulation of
   recovery efficiency and RC50 were negatively correlated with the
   colonizer-persister (C-P) classification of taxa, which discriminates
   nematodes according to their reproductive potential. The maturity index,
   which relates to a nematode community's state of disturbance and
   eutrophication, was negatively correlated with CuSO(4) concentration.
   The properties of the applied test method are discussed as are the
   relationships between the investigated short-term toxicity effects and
   long-term toxicity processes in the field. From the large range of
   observed RC50 values, it is concluded that a meaningful sensitivity
   classification of nematodes should be possible and thus would allow for
   a sensitive bioindication of heavy-metal pollution. From the correlation
   between RC50 and C-P classification, the authors further conclude that
   the maturity index will, in addition to enrichment and disturbance,
   respond to heavy-metal pollution and thus may serve as a general
   indicator of soil health.}},

Abstract = {{Field experiments were conducted in villages around National Capital
   Power Project (NCPP), Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, India during 1995 to
   evaluate flyash incorporation effects on soil health and growth and
   yield of maize (Zea mays L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.). Flyash
   application levels (up to 10t/ha) were decided on the basis of an
   ash/dust fall range of 5 to 12 t/ha/y in the villages adjoining thermal
   power station. The grain yield of maize increased in flyash added plots,
   whereas rice yield was similar to flyash treated plots. Flyash added
   plots had marginally higher uptake of Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Cd, but values
   were insignificant. Flyash application in soil resulted in lower bulk
   density. Flyash addition also reduced hydraulic conductivity and
   improved moisture retention at field capacity and permanent wilting
   point. These changes in the soil characteristics might have been due to
   modifications in the macro- and micro-pore size distribution which also
   contributed to increased yield of maize in light and medium textured
   soils.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture in limited resource areas is characterized by small farms
   which an generally too small to adequately support the needs of an
   average farm family. The farming operation can be described as a low
   input cropping system with the main energy source being manual labor,
   draught animals and in some areas hand tractors. These farming systems
   are the most important contributor to the national economy of many
   developing countries.
   The role of tillage is similar in dryland agricultural systems in both
   the high input (HICS) and low input cropping systems (LICS), however,
   wet cultivation or puddling is unique to lowland rice-based systems in
   low input cropping systems. Evidence suggest that tillage may result in
   marginal increases in crop yield in the short term, however, in the
   longer term it may be neutral or give rise to yield decreases associated
   with soil structural degradation. On marginal soils, tillage may be
   required to prepare suitable seedbeds or to release adequate Nitrogen
   through mineralization, but in the longer term, however, tillage reduces
   soil organic matter content, increases soil erodibility and the emission
   of greenhouse gases.
   Tillage in low input cropping systems involves a very large proportion
   of the population and any changes: in current practices such as
   increased mechanization will have a large social impact such as
   increased unemployment and increasing feminization of poverty, as
   mechanization may actually reduce jobs for women. Rapid mechanization is
   likely to result in failures, but slower change, accompanied by measures
   to provide alternative rural employment, might be beneficial.
   Agriculture in limited resource areas must produce the food and fiber
   needs of their community, and its future depends on the development of
   sustainable tillage/cropping systems that are suitable for the soil and
   climatic conditions. These should be based on sound biophysical
   principles and meet the needs of and he acceptable to the farming
   communities. Some of the principle requirements for a sustainable system
   includes the maintenance of soil health, an increase in the rain water
   use efficiency of the system, increased use of fertilizer and the
   prevention of erosion. The maintenance of crop residues on the surface
   is paramount for meeting these requirements, and the competing use of
   crop residues must be met from other sources. These requirements can be
   met within a zonal tillage system combined with suitable agroforestry,
   which will reduce the need for crop residues. It is, however, essential
   that farmers participate in the development of any new technologies to
   ensure adoption of the new system. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Concentrations of particulate and total organic matter were measured in
   upper soil profiles at 26 sites as a potential means to identify toxic
   damage to soil ecosystems. Because soil organic matter plays a role in
   cycling nutrients, aerating soil, retaining water, and maintaining
   tilth, a significant reduction in organic matter content in a soil
   profile is not just evidence of a change in ecosystem function, but of
   damage to that soil ecosystem. Reference sites were selected for
   comparison to contaminated sites, and additional sites were selected to
   illustrate how variables other than environmental contaminants might
   affect the soil organic matter profile. The survey was undertaken on the
   supposition that environmental contaminants and other stressors reduce
   the activity of earthworms and other macrofauna, inhibiting the
   incorporation of organic matter into the soil profile. The profiles of
   the unstressed soils showed a continuous decrease in organic matter
   content from the uppermost mineral soil layer (0-2.5 cm) down to 15 cm.
   Stressed soils showed an abrupt decrease in soil organic matter content
   below a depth of 2.5 cm. The 2.5-5.0 cm layer of stressed soils-such as
   found in a pine barren, an orchard, sites contaminated with zinc, and a
   site with compacted soil-had less than 4 \% total organic matter and
   less than 1 \% particulate organic matter. However, damaged soil
   ecosystems were best identified by comparison of their profiles to the
   profiles of closely matched reference soils, rather than by comparison
   to these absolute values. The presence or absence of earthworms offered
   a partial explanation of observed differences in soil organic matter
   profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural sustainability depends to a great extent upon the
   maintenance of soil health. There is no single measurement that can be
   made for its quantification although certain soil biophysical and
   chemical characteristics are found to be key potential indicators of
   soil health. An agricultural sustainability index (ASI) is proposed to
   measure agricultural sustainability as a function of biophysical,
   chemical, economic and social indicators.
   It was tested on a regional dataset from China. It showed marked changes
   in sustainability over a 9-year period and between regions within the
   coastal zone. This index appears promising for assessing agricultural
   sustainability. It permits the comparison of relative sustainability of
   different agroecosystems and can be used to compare agricultural
   sustainability across regions, although care must be taken in the choice
   of rating scale for the component indicators and further research in
   this is needed. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{There is little information on the effects of S management strategies on
   soil microorganisms under zero tillage systems on the North American
   Prairies. Experiments were conducted to examine the effects of tillage
   and source and placement of S on soil microbial biomass (substrate
   induced respiration) and functional diversity (substrate utilization
   patterns) in a canola-wheat rotation under conventional and zero tillage
   systems at three sites in Gray Luvisolic and Black Chernozemic soils.
   Conventional tillage significantly reduced microbial biomass and
   diversity on an acidic and C-poor Luvisolic soil, but it had mostly no
   significant effects on the near-neutral, C-rich Luvisolic and
   Chernozemic soils, which underlines the importance of soil C in
   maintaining a healthy soil. Sulphur had no significant effects on soil
   microbial biomass, and its effects on microbial diversity were more
   frequent on the near-neutral Luvisol, which was more S-deficient, than
   on the acidic Luvisol or the Chernozem. Significant S effects on
   microbial diversity were observed both in the bulk soil (negative
   effects, compared with the control) and rhizosphere (positive effects)
   of the acidic Luvisol, but all significant effects (positive) were
   observed in root rhizospheres in the other soils. Sulphur by tillage
   interactions on acidic Luvisolic soil indicated that the negative
   effects of S in bulk soil occurred mostly under zero tillage, presumably
   because the fertilizer is concentrated in a smaller volume of soil than
   under conventional tillage. Sulphate S effects, either negative or
   positive, on microbial diversity were usually greater than elemental S
   effects. Therefore, S application can have direct, deleterious effects
   on soil microorganisms or indirect, beneficial effects through crop
   growth, the latter presumably due to increased root exudation in the
   rhizosphere of healthy crops.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations were made to recycle agricultural and agro-industrial
   wastes for the production of vermicompost using earthworms (Eudrilus
   eugeniae). Its response was studied in a rice-legume cropping system.
   Different combinations of coirpith/weeds and cowdung/sugarcane
   pressmud/biodigested slurry were tried for vermicomposting. The study
   showed that biodigested slurry and weeds was found to be an ideal
   combination for vermicomposting considering the nutrient content and
   compost maturity period. The C/N ratio of vermicompost reduced to
   12-17:1 from 21-69:1. A pot culture study evaluated the effect of
   vermicompost in comparison to biodigested slurry and farmyard manure
   (FYM) on an equal N basis with and without biofertilizer in rice. The
   study showed that the integrated application of vermicompost, fertilizer
   N and biofertilizers viz., Azospirillum and phosphobacteria increased
   rice yield by 15.9\%( over application with fertilizer N alone. A field
   experiment studied the direct and residual effect or different sources
   of organic N with fertilizer N and biofertilizers in rice -legume crop
   sequence. The integrated application of 50\%,, N through vermicompost,
   50\%,) via fertilizer N and biofertilizers recorded a grain yield of
   6.25 and 0.51 t ha(-1) in the rice and legume, respectively. These
   yields were 12.2 and 19.9\%,) higher than those obtained with 100\%
   fertilizer N alone. On average, integrated application increased the N.
   P and K uptake by 15.3, 10.7 and 9.4\% respectively in rice over
   fertilizer N alone. Organic carbon content in the residual soil after
   rice was not depleted due to integrated application. After the legume,
   organic carbon content increased by 4.55 to 6.82\% due to integrated
   nutrition compared to fertilizer alone. Available N in the residual soil
   was stable after the rice-legume system. Available P and K contents of
   the residual soil were depleted considerably in the rice-legume
   sequence. However, the amount or depletion of available N, P and K in
   the fertilizer alone treatment was greater than to the integrated
   nutrition. The microbial population of the residual soil was increased
   by integrated application. The studies indicate that integrated
   nutrition comprising vermicompost. fertilizers N and biofertilizers
   could be applied to rice-legume cropping system to achieve higher yields
   and sustain soil health. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   application of paper-factory sludge with fly ash and chemical
   fertilizers significantly enhanced grain and straw yields 3.6 and 3.3\%

   The uptake of N and P was higher (9.5 and 3.3 kg/ha) when paper-factory
   sludge along with fly ash was applied at transplanting compared with
   their application at 30 days before transplanting. Such trend in K
   uptake could be noted only in the second year. The paper-factory sludge

Abstract = {{The terms ``soil health{''} or ``soil quality{''} as applied to
   agroecosystems refer to the ability of soil to support and sustain crop
   growth while maintaining environmental quality. High-quality soils have
   the following characteristics: (i) a sufficient, but not excess, supply
   of nutrients; (ii) good structure (tilth); (iii) sufficient depth for
   rooting and drainage; (iv) good internal drainage; (v) low populations
   of plant disease and parasitic organisms; (vi) high populations of
   organisms that promote plant growth; (vii) low weed pressure; (viii) no
   chemicals that might harm the plant; (ix) resistance to being degraded;
   and (x) resilience following an episode of degradation. Management
   intended to improve soil health involves creatively combining a number
   of practices that enhance the soil's biological, chemical, and physical
   suitability for crop production. The most important general strategy is
   to add plentiful quantities of organic matter-including crop and cover
   crop residues, manures, and composts. Other important strategies include
   better crop rotations, reducing tillage and keeping the soil surface
   covered with living and dead residue, reducing compaction by decreasing
   heavy equipment traffic, and using best nutrient management practices.
   Practices that enhance soil quality frequently reduce plant pest
   pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Organic pest and disease management strategies should, from principle,
   be largely preventative and depend on a whole systems approach, with
   maintenance of soil health a central component of any strategy. This
   paper presents a summary of the most serious pest and disease problems
   encountered in a range of organic vegetable production systems over the
   past three seasons in England and Wales. The major crops all showed some
   specific pest and disease problems and overall about 10\% crops had
   serious losses. Growers consistently rated potato late blight as the
   most important disease problem and carrot fly, aphids and cabbage root
   fly as important pests. Slugs and birds are also a significant, but
   probably underrated problem, in crops such as brassicas. Priorities for
   improving management strategies can now be identified. Knowledge
   transfer is a key issue, as growers require a high level of biological
   understanding to plan and manage organic systems. Various factors, such
   as size and type of enterprise, past cropping practices, the economic
   and biological diversity of the holding as well as the marketing outlets
   of the farm, are likely to affect the type and effectiveness of
   management strategies employed.}},

Abstract = {{The soil quality was evaluated following the addition of organic matter
   and microorganisms to a clay loam soil collected in Aranjuez (Madrid)
   under controlled conditions of temperature and moisture, and over a
   period of three months. The following treatments were carried out: soil
   (control); soil + 50 t/ha of animal manure (E50); soil + 50 t/ha of
   animal manure + 301/ha of effective microorganisms (E50EM); soil + 30
   t/ha of combination of various green crop residues and weeds (RC30) and
   soil + 30 t/ha of combination of various green crop residues and weeds +
   301/ha of effective microorganisms (RC30EM). The soil samples were taken
   before and after the incubation and analysed using physical, chemical
   and microbiological parameters. A significant increase in the production
   of polysaccharides and alkaline phosphatase and esterase enzymes in the
   treatments E50EM and RC30EM was observed, being in direct correlation
   with the humification of the organic matter, with the water retention at
   field capacity, and with the cationic exchange capacity (CEC). It can be
   concluded that the incorporation of microorganisms EM potentialized the
   soil biological activity and improved physicochemical soil properties,
   contributing to a quick humification of fresh organic matter. Those
   findings were proved by microbiological activities of exopolysaccharides
   by alcaline phosphatase and esterase enzymes, which can be used as
   earlier and integral soil health indicators.}},

Abstract = {{Sufficient information is available to show that pesticides can be
   properly applied and used safely in forest management. However, much of
   the information on the effects of pesticides on soil organisms is often
   based on methodologies involving soil processes (i.e., toxicology
   studies) rather than on individual groups of organisms. Because more
   than one group of soil organisms may carry out the same function, the
   effects of pesticides on a particular group can be missed. On the other
   hand, while laboratory test may show pesticide effects on one group
   under an array of controlled conditions, the same organism may respond
   differently in a field setting. Not much information is available on
   soil organisms resulting from combining various silvicultural herbicides
   or pesticides. Information is presented to show that with few
   exceptions, pesticides can affect soil organism populations, but the
   effects may be short-term with little noticeable long-term affect on
   soil health and quality.}},

Abstract = {{Composting is most commonly perceived as a waste management process. As
   a result the biological stability of composts can vary substantially,
   and their agronomic value is rarely specified. However it is possible to
   manage the composting process to maximise the fertiliser and soil health
   properties of the product. Managing the bulk density, the water content
   and the temperature profile of the windrow can substantially improve
   microbial activity, and the mineralisation of nutrients. Quality
   controlled composts have the potential to improve the physical, chemical
   and biological properties of soil. To maximise the net present
   fertiliser value of the product, the end-point of the composting process
   must be dictated by the availability of nutrients and indicators of
   biological stability. Assigning carbon credits to the biologically
   active organic carbon fraction of a compost will enhance the adoption of
   composting for the sustainable recycling of organic waste.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decade, advances in our understanding of biodegradation
   principles, and lessons learned from bioremediation applications, have
   increased our knowledge base to help transition laboratory-based
   processes to the field. Within the group of organic anthropogenic
   compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), chlorinated volatile
   organic compounds (VOC), and the alkylbenzene (benzene, toluene, ethyl
   benzene, and the xylenes, BTEX) hydrocarbons are among the most
   frequently encountered pollutants in soils, groundwater aquifers and
   sediments. This chapter aims to describe the challenges posed by, and
   methodologies used during, the transfer of biodegradation principles to
   field application by addressing the following specific objectives: (i)
   principles of technology transfer and application to a chlorinated
   solvent-contaminated site, (ii) principles and applications of PAH, VOC,
   and BTEX bioremediation, and (iii) principles and applications of soil
   health assessment. Whereas the fundamental processes of biodegradation
   have been well established, harnessing these processes for in situ
   application is fraught with substantial uncertainty. These uncertainties
   are mainly due to site specificities associated with expression of the
   desired biodegradation activity, the difficulty with establishing causal
   relationships between biological activity and geochemical (organic and
   inorganic) changes, and the lack of data for a convincing cost-benefit
   analysis associated with bioremediation applications (i.e. does the
   investment of time and money substantially increase the overall health
   of the impacted environmental compartment?). In addition to the
   requirement for substantial technical expertise, these uncertainties are
   major impediments for site managers, problem owners, and technology
   adopters and implementers to make effective use of bioremediation
   technologies. The results indicate the need of more research on the use
   of in situ biomonitoring techniques at various temporal and spatial
   scales of environmental impact, and in optimization strategies for
   technology implementation within a quantitative uncertainty-based
   decision framework.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated use of organic and inorganic fertilizers can improve crop
   productivity and sustain soil health and fertility. The present research
   was conducted with an objective to study the influence of application of
   farmyard manure in combination with three levels of chemical fertilizers
   {[}80: 40: 30, 120: 60: 45 and 160: 80: 60 kg N, P2O5 and K2O ha(-1),
   respectively] on yield and yield components of irrigated lowland rice.
   The experiment was conducted in split-plot design during the rainy
   season with and without farmyard manure as main plots and three
   inorganic fertilizer levels as subplots. Data on grain and straw yield,
   number of tillers, panicle length, filled grains per panicle, 1000-grain
   weight and nutrient uptake were collected. The results showed that
   application of farmyard manure at 10 tha(-1) increased grain yield of
   rice by 25\% compared to no farmyard manure control. Similar
   observations were also made on straw yield, tiller number, filled grains
   per panicle, and 1000-grain weight. There were significant interactions
   between farmyard manure and inorganic fertilizer treatments. The
   beneficial effects of;application of farmyard manure were not enhanced
   at increased rates of application of inorganic fertilizers. However, the
   highest grain yield of rice was obtained with the application of
   farmyard manure at 10 tha(-1) and inorganic fertilizer at 120 : 60 : 45
   kg N, P2O5 and K2O ha(-1). The increased grain yield was due mainly to
   increased nutrient uptake and number of tillers, filled grains per
   panicle and 1000-grain weight.}},

Abstract = {{Large volumes of wool scour waste are placed in Victorian landfills
   every year at a high cost. Wool scour sludges can be effectively
   composted by blending with other materials to produce a value-added
   product that is nutrient rich and an ideal soil ameliorant for
   increasing organic matter and conserving moisture.
   Past studies of the use of composted wool scour waste in horticultural
   production have shown significant improvements in crop production and
   soil structure after one application. It was envisaged that major
   benefits in soil health would also be gained in broadacre-cropping soils
   if ameliorated with composted wool scour waste.
   In 2001, a long-term field trial was established to investigate the
   effect of composted wool scour waste for broadacre cropping and to
   determine the optimal rates and frequency of compost application over
   several cropping seasons. The field study is being undertaken at
   Southern Farming Systems in Gnarwarre, 20km west of Geelong. Composted
   wool scour sludge was applied to raised beds at 10 different rates,
   replicated 6 times. A variety of soil and crop properties are being
   monitored throughout the trial. The results from the first year
   demonstrate the effectiveness of compost applications as a means of
   increasing soil organic matter and moisture retention, thereby improving
   conditions for crop root development.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in the quality and health of soil has been stimulated by recent
   awareness that soil is vital to both production of food and fiber and
   global ecosystems function. Soil health, or quality, can be broadly
   defined as the capacity of a living soil to function, within natural or
   managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity,
   maintain or enhance water and air quality, and promote plant and animal
   health. Soil quality and health change over time due to natural events
   or human impacts. They are enhanced by management and land-use decisions
   that weigh the multiple functions of soil and are impaired by decisions
   which focus only on single functions, such as crop productivity.
   Criteria for indicators of soil quality and health relate mainly to
   their utility in defining ecosystem processes and in integrating
   physical, chemical, and biological properties, their sensitivity to
   management and climatic variations, and their accessibility and utility
   to agricultural specialists, producers, conservationists, and policy
   makers. Although soils have an inherent quality as related to their
   physical, chemical, and biological properties within the constraints set
   by climate and ecosystems, the ultimate determinant of soil quality and
   health is the land manager. As such, the assessment of soil quality or
   health, and direction of change with time, is the primary indicator of
   sustainable management. Scientists can make a significant contribution
   to sustainable land management by translating scientific knowledge and
   information on soil function into practical tools and approaches by
   which land managers can assess the sustainability of their management
   practices. The first steps, however, in our communal journey towards
   sustainable land management must be the identification of our final
   destination (sustainability goals), the strategies or course by which we
   will get there, and the indicators (benchmarks) that we are proceeding
   in the right direction. We too often rush to raise the sails of our
   `technological' ship to catch the wind, before knowing from where it
   comes or in property defining our destination, charting our course, and
   setting the rudder of our ship. Examples are given of approaches for
   assessing soil quality and health to define the sustainability of land
   management practices and to `translate our science into practice'. (C)

Abstract = {{Integrated use of organic and inorganic fertilizers can improve crop
   productivity and sustain soil health and fertility. The present research
   was conducted to study the effects of application of green manures
   {[}sesbania (Sesbania aculeate Poiret) and crotalaria (Crotalaria juncea
   L.)] and farmyard manure on productivity of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and
   its residual effects on subsequent groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) crop.
   Rice and groundnut crops were grown in sequence during rainy and
   postrainy seasons with and without green manure in combination with
   different fertilizer and spacing treatments under irrigated conditions.
   The results showed that application of green manures sesbania and
   crotalaria at 10 t ha(-1) to rice compared to no green manure
   application significantly increased grain yield of rice by 1.6 and 1.1 t
   ha(-1), and pod yields of groundnut crop succeeding rice by 0.25 and
   0.16 t ha(-1), respectively. There was no significant difference between
   the application of crotalaria or farmyard manure at 10 t ha(-1) on grain
   yields of rice, but pod yields of subsequent groundnut crop were greater
   with application of green manure. There was no significant effect of
   different spacing 20 x 15, 15 x 15, 15 x 10 cm 2 (333 000; 444 000; 666
   000 plant ha(-1), respectively) on grain yield of rice. Pod yields of
   groundnut were significantly greater with closer spacing 15 x 15 cm(2)
   (444 000 plants ha(-1)) as compared to spacing of 30 x 10 cm(2) (333 000
   plants ha(-1)). Maximum grain of rice was obtained by application of
   120:26:37 kg NPK ha(-1) in combination with green manures, whereas
   maximum pod yield of groundnut was obtained by residual effect of green
   manure applied to rice and application of 30:26:33 kg NPK ha(-1) in
   combination with gypsum applied to groundnut crop. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sowing other crops in rotation with cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) has
   proven to be a successful strategy employed by farmers to reverse yield
   decline and maintain soil quality. The objectives of this study were to
   quantify soil macro-invertebrate abundance and composition with and
   without N fertiliser application during the wheat-cropping phase of a
   cotton-based rotational system. Comparison with invertebrate abundance
   was also made with an adjacent area of native vegetation. The experiment
   was first established in 1993, but invertebrate sampling was only
   conducted between June and December 1997, during the winter wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) phase at 6,15 and 23 weeks after planting (WAP)
   the crop and in nearby native vegetation at the same time. Ants were
   identified to genera and all other invertebrates to order. Changes in
   crop cover and soil temperature were also evaluated at 6, 15 and 23 WAR
   Ant abundance was higher in the treatments where N fertiliser was not
   applied, but only later in the season (summer), compared to the
   treatments where N fertiliser was applied. Other invertebrates showed a
   similar pattern of recovery to ants, with higher levels of abundance in
   summer compared with earlier in the wheat growing cycle. The use of ants
   as bioindicators for monitoring changes in soil health within
   cotton-based rotational systems, especially in the wheat-cropping phase,
   is complicated by the confounding factor of seasonality, although their
   fluctuations in abundance mimic other invertebrates. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper reviews how the health of humans is affected by the world's
   soils, an association that to date has been under appreciated and under
   reported. Soils significantly influence a variety of functions (e.g. as
   a plant growth medium; its importance on the cycling of water; as a
   foundation for buildings) that sustains the human population. Through
   ingestion (either deliberate or involuntary), inhalation and dermal
   absorption, the mineral, chemical and biological components of soils can
   either be directly beneficial or detrimental to human health. Specific
   examples include: geohelminth infection and the supply of mineral
   nutrients and potentially harmful elements (PHEs) via soil ingestion;
   cancers caused by the inhalation of fibrous minerals or Rn gas derived
   from the radioactive decay of U and Th in soil minerals; and tetanus,
   hookworm disease and podoconiosis caused by skin contact and dermal
   absorption of appropriate soil constituents. Human health can also be
   influenced in more indirect ways as soils interact with the atmosphere,
   biosphere and hydrosphere. Examples include: the volatilisation of
   persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from soils and their subsequent
   global redistribution that has health implications to the Aboriginal
   people of the Arctic; the frequent detrimental chemical and biological
   quality of drinking and recreational waters that are influenced by
   processes of soil erosion, surface runoff, interflow and leaching; and
   the transfer of mineral nutrients and PHEs from soils into the plants
   and animals that constitute the human food chain. The scale and
   magnitude of soil/health interactions are variable, but at times a
   considerable number of people can be affected as demonstrated by. the
   extent of hookworm infection or the number of people at risk because
   they live in an I-deficient environment. Nevertheless, it can often be
   difficult to establish definite links between soils and human health.
   This, together with the emergence of new risks, knowledge, or
   discoveries, means that there is considerable scope for research in the
   future. Such investigations should involve a multidisciplinary approach
   that both acquires knowledge and ensures its dissemination to people in
   an understandable way. This requires an infrastructure and finance that
   governments need to be responsive to. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Sales of organic products reached \$8 billion in the U.S. in 2000,
   continuing the nearly decade-long trend of 20\% annual growth. In Iowa
   alone, organic production for all crops was 5265 ha (13,000 acres) in
   1995 but 60,750 ha (150,000 acres) in 1999. Despite the growth in
   organic agriculture, our knowledge of organic farming systems remains
   limited. We have adopted a systems theory approach in our current
   research program at Iowa State University (ISU) to help address this gap
   in understanding. Systems theory holds that biological systems, such as
   agroecosystems, consist of integrated units of people, plants, animals,
   soil, insects and microorganisms, and each subsystem provides feedback
   to the other. In order to obtain input on research questions and
   experimental design, the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture and
   ISU held six focus groups across Iowa in 1998 before long-term site
   establishment. Producers and agricultural professionals at the focus
   groups supported the need for long-term agroccological research (LTAR)
   sites in four distinct agroecological zones in Iowa. The goal of each
   LTAR is to examine the short- and long-term physical, biological, and
   socioeconomic effects of organic and conventional farming systems. By
   establishing long-term experiments, we are testing the hypothesis that
   longer crop rotations, typical of organic farms, provide yield
   stability, improve plant protection, and enhance soil health and
   economic benefits compared to conventional systems with shorter
   rotations and greater off-farm inputs. Examples of research results from
   two LTAR experiments in Iowa include similar pepper (Capsicum annuum)
   and soybean (Glycine max) yields in the conventional and organic
   systems. Organic systems used mechanical weed control and locally
   produced compost in place of synthetic fertilizers. Feedback from the
   local farm associations that are responsible for farm stewardship and
   farm finances is inherent in the LTAR process.}},

Abstract = {{A laboratory incubation study was carried out to elucidate the dynamic
   response of insecticide (triazophos) on a paddy field soil health under
   controlled moisture (flooded soil) and temperature (25degreesC). The
   insecticide was applied at five levels that were 0.0 (control), 0.5
   field rate (FR), 1.0 FR, 5.0 FR, and 10.0 FR, where FR was 1500
   ml/hm(2), and the parameters were studied at 1, 4, 7, 14, and 21 days
   after treatments' addition. The electron transport system
   (ETS)/dehydrogenase activity exhibited a negative correlation with
   insecticide concentrations, and the activity affected adversely as the
   concentration increased. The higher doses of 5 and 10 field rates
   significantly reduced the ETS activity, while lower rates failed to
   produce any significant inhibiting effect against the control. The
   toxicity of insecticide decreased towards decreasing the ETS activity
   with the advancement of incubation period. The insecticide caused an
   improvement in the soil phenol content and it increased with increasing
   concentration of insecticide. The insecticide incorporation applied at
   various concentrations did not produce any significant change in soil
   protein content and it remained stable throughout the incubation period
   of 21 - days. The response of biomass phospholipid content was nearly
   similar to ETS activity. The phospholipid content was decreased with the
   addition of insecticide and the toxicity was in the order; 10 FR (field
   rate) > 5 FR > 1.0 FR > 0.5 FR > control. and it also decreased with
   incubation period.}},

Abstract = {{To restore fertility and productivity of saline soil through
   bioremediation, a farm-scale trial was undertaken by exploring the
   effect of three factors, viz, soil conditioner (SC, recycled agrowaste),
   halophiles culture, and a plant growth regulator (PGR), modified
   industrial byproduct. A three factor factorial design was used with each
   factor at two levels - the lower level indicated no treatment, while the
   upper level indicated treatment, and there were eight experiments in
   all, which were replicated thrice. One out of the eight treatment
   combinations was without SC, PGR, or halophiles inputs served as
   control. The plantation and growth of Casuarina equisetifolia, in the
   treated soils as per the design, was monitored through various relevant
   parameters that included soil characteristics, level of (micro)
   nutrients, and exchangeable cations, and growth-related parameters. The
   analysis of data thus generated through appropriate ANOVA indicated an
   overwhelming role of SC in the bioremediation of soil salinity and
   growth parameters of the C equisetifolia plantation, followed by that of
   halophiles and then the PGR as envisaged. The role of PGR was however
   important in first establishing the plantation in the saline soil, when
   halophiles get enough time to establish favourable pattern and
   concentration of microbes in soil by up to more than a million times of
   the initial microflora level of 5.9x10(3)/g soil. Data collected up to
   six months clearly indicated bioremediation of the otherwise saline
   soil, and effectiveness of the given treatments was evident. It is
   proposed that such bio-measures may go a long way in converting large
   tracts of saline soils into fertile ones with healthy soil-microflora in
   an eco-friendly manner which is cost-effective as well.}},

Abstract = {{The ground water (GW), treated wastewater (TW) and the soil at the
   agricultural farm in the premises of the Mathura Oil Refinery have been
   monitored for various physico-chemical characteristics, over the last 12
   years (1987-1998). It was noted that the heavy metal content in the
   soil, repeatedly irrigated with TW, was increasing because the
   wastewater itself was a better source of these metals than GW. However,
   the level of these metals, both in the wastewater and the soil, was very
   much below the permissible limits. The quantitative analysis of various
   functional groups of microorganism and their interaction with metals
   revealed that the viable count of aerobic heterotrophs, asymbiotic
   nitrogen fixers, actinomycetes and fungi were in the ranges of 2.6 x
   10(6)-7.2 x 10(7), 5.0 x 10(4)-6.8 x 10(5), 2.0 x 10(4)-2.8 x 10(5) and
   2.5 x 10(4)-7.5 x 10(5), respectively. The presence of Rhizobium spp. in
   the soil was shown by the nodulation in the leguminous crops cultivated
   in the experimental field. The significant viable counts of above
   functional groups of bacteria on each heavy metal supplemented plate
   indicated that these populations could tolerate high levels (greater
   than or equal to200 mug/ml) of metal. Among them, nitrogen fixers and
   aerobic heterotrophs (largely, Gram-negative) had a higher degree of
   resistance to heavy metals than actinomycetes. Similarly, the strains of
   Rhizobium, isolated from the experimental field, showed a higher degree
   of resistance under in vitro conditions and the minimum inhibitory
   concentration (MIC) was in the range of 50-800 mug/ml, determined by a
   plate dilution method. It may, therefore, be deduced that 12 years
   repeated application of treated wastewater had not significantly changed
   the microbial dynamics of the soil and possibly the bacteria had adapted
   to the changed soil environment by developing various levels of metal
   resistance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Increased disturbance of terrestrial ecosystems in recent years for
   purposes of mineral extraction has created interest in development and
   optimization of reclamation methodologies for these lands. Currently,
   criteria for judging surface mine reclamation success, or progress
   toward reclamation goals, predominantly rely on aboveground indicators
   that fail to account for the abundance and composition of soil
   microbiota, an essential aspect of soil health. To test the utility of
   fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) biomarkers as indicators of reclamation
   progress, FAME bacterial, fungal, and total biomass biomarkers extracted
   from soil of surface mine reclamation sites of different ages and an
   adjacent undisturbed site were compared with other indicators of
   reclamation progress and ecosystem stability. Our results indicate that
   FAME microbial biomarkers and soil organic matter (SOM) contents were
   greatly impacted by disturbance. Discriminant analysis of FAME
   bacterial, fungal and total microbial biomass biomarkers, although
   clearly able to discriminate between disturbed and undisturbed
   ecosystems, indicated a trend towards the undisturbed condition with
   reclamation age. The ratio of FAME bacterial to fungal biomarkers
   reflected changes in other indicators of soil health (SOM, inorganic N
   concentration), suggesting that this ratio is a useful indicator of
   reclamation progress. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Integration of a crop between the dry and wet season is known to capture
   nitrate-N which otherwise is lost upon flooding. Often a transition crop
   is of short duration and its biomass is incorporated into the soil as
   green manure. Although N dynamics as influenced by transition crop have
   been studied, not much is known about carbon dynamics and its residue
   management. Experiments conducted in four farmers' fields in the
   Philippines utilizing a rice- (Oryza sativa L.) sweet pepper (Capsicum
   annuum L.) system aimed to determine the effects of different transition
   crops like indigo (Indigofera tinctoria L.), indigo plus mungbean (Vigna
   radiata L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) grown during the dry-to-wet (DTW)
   transition on total and labile C pools. The decrease in labile C with
   cropping ranged from 6\% to 21\% and increase with residue incorporation
   ranged from 18\% to 37\% at different sites, but total C remained
   unchanged. The labile C balance indicated a loss of up to 1,438 kg halt
   due to farming practices and a gain of up to 3,077 kg ha(-1) with
   residue addition. Catch crop residue management in intensive rice-based
   cropping systems can play a role in maintaining soil health, as
   indicated by the improvement in labile C. Labile C is sensitive to soil
   management practices, and thus provides a better measurement of C
   dynamics in the short to medium term than total C alone.}},

Abstract = {{Unplanned and unsustainable development (particularly rapid
   industrialisation) has placed great pressure in every dimension of the
   environment (air, water, soil, health, etc.). The resulting disturbance
   in the natural ecological balance is a serious concern. Sustainable
   development is the need of the hour; it can only be achieved through
   effective environmental management. Environmental management will become
   indispensable in the future as regulatory restrictions tighten and
   public expectations of environmental performance increase. The day is
   not far away when a customer will prefer to buy products produced by an
   environmentally committed organisation. In short, the environmental
   commitment of an organisation will become a market strategy.
   Environmental management is a set of actions based on a structured
   methodology to ensure that an organisation is committed to the
   environment and that the production process has minimal/no adverse
   affect on it. This article emphasises environmental management in the
   real engineering sense of the term, and discusses how to develop an
   effective environmental management system through life cycle assessment.
   It further demonstrates through a real life case study how an industry
   has achieved landmark success in managing its environment, production,
   as well as winning the good faith of society. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Organic matter and its replenishment has become a major component of
   soil health management programs. Many of the soil's physical, chemical,
   and biological properties are a function of organic matter content and
   quality. Adding organic matter to soil influences diverse and important
   biological activities. The diversity and number of free-living and
   plant-parasitic nematodes are altered by rotational crops, cover crops,
   green manures, and other sources of organic matter. Soil management
   programs should include the use of the proper organic materials to
   improve soil chemical, physical, and biological parameters and to
   suppress plant-parasitic nematodes and soilborne pathogens. It is
   critical to monitor the effects of organic matter additions on
   activities of major and minor plant-parasitic nematodes in the
   production system. This paper presents a general review of information
   in the literature on the effects of crop rotation, cover crops, and
   green manures On nematodes and their damage to economic crops.}},

   and sewage effluents. In recent years, the rationale for determining
   these properties has been to ascertain if they have a potential role as
   early warning indicators of adverse effects of effluent irrigation on
   treatment sustainability and/or soil health. In this review, I summarise
   the findings from these studies and attempt to establish whether the
   data do support this role. Assessment of biochemical effects of the
   application of effluents to land under crops, forest, or scrub is
   complicated by previous land management and by site characteristics.
   Consequently, only investigations of effluent application onto pastoral
   soils have allowed an assessment of the potential value of soil
   biochemical properties as early-warning indicators of adverse effects.
   Generally, these studies have shown that effluent application has had a
   beneficial effect on soil properties and plant growth and this is
   reflected by enhanced soil biochemical activities. Where an adverse
   effect did occur in response to a drastic change of effluent amount and
   composition, soil biochemical properties were markedly reduced. However,
   soil chemical properties and aggregate stability were unaffected. This
   suggests, therefore, that there could be a role for biochemical
   properties as indices of performance and sustainability of land-based
   effluent irrigation systems. However, with most studies showing that
   most effluent application is beneficial, such a role may be limited to
   situations where the effluent is to be applied at an amount, or has a
   composition that has not been previously tested. The main conclusion
   from this review is that when irrigation schemes have been running for a
   number of years and are functioning well, soil biochemical properties
   reflect the soil health enhancements provided by the water and nutrients
   added. Such enhancements are generally manifested slowly and, therefore,
   monitoring is required over a longer duration than has occurred in
   several of the studies examined. Adverse effects attributable to
   effluent irrigation are more difficult to recognise and interpret unless
   a drastic change has occurred, due mainly to methodological limitations
   and our lack of understanding of the true meaning of what we are
   measuring or its relevance to soil functioning. Until our understanding
   improves markedly, a predictive role for these properties as an early
   warning of adverse effects of effluent irrigation will remain elusive.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional agriculture has had major environmental impacts, in
   particular with respect to soil degradation. Soil structure, fertility,
   microbial and faunal biodiversity have declined, and root diseases are
   common unless genetic resistance, soil fumigation and/or seed treatments
   are used. Primarily for environmental reasons and increasing demands for
   safe and healthy food from the public, farmers have switched over to
   organic production at an increasing rate. During a transition period of
   about 5 years, organic farmers may face problems with yield losses and
   pest or disease problems. However, in well-managed, long-term organic
   farms, soilborne diseases need not be a problem. Several studies in
   which disease severity was compared in organic and conventional farming
   systems (or with soils from those systems) showed that root diseases are
   generally less severe in organically than conventionally managed soils.
   The reasons for reduced root disease severity have seldom been
   investigated, although relationships with nitrogen supply or microbial
   diversity have sometimes been found. Crop protection in organic farming
   is generally not directed at controlling particular pathogens or pests
   but at management of the environment so that plants are able to
   withstand potential attacks. Resistant cultivars adapted to the local
   conditions are in demand among organic farmers. However, the main
   practices that contribute to disease control are long, balanced
   rotations, organic amendments and reduced tillage, all geared towards
   maintenance of the soil organic matter content and fertility. Organic
   farmers can make use of biological control agents and natural toxic
   compounds in plant extracts. However, these practices are methods of
   last resort.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decade, a range of indicators has been advocated for
   assessing soil, farm and catchment health. This paper assembles some
   recent experiences of the authors in developing and using indicators
   from paddock to national scales. Indicators are merely a subset of the
   attributes that are used to quantify aspects of catchment or farm
   health. Their selection and use in the past has led to criticism of
   indicators, but, given an explicit approach, most of the criticisms can
   be overcome. Reliable indicators provide positive and negative signals
   about the current status of natural resources and how these properties
   have changed over time. They are used both to identify potential risks
   and to confirm that current farming practices and systems of land use
   are effective in maintaining the resource base or economic status. They
   should be precursors for change and future on-ground investments when
   problems are observed or identified.
   A structured approach is needed to ensure indicators are selected and
   used efficiently. This approach involves: deciding local issues and
   selecting the most appropriate indicators to reflect those issues;
   interpreting both positive and negative signals from the monitoring
   process; taking appropriate action to resolve problems; and, using
   indicators to monitor the outcomes from the action taken.
   Finally, we have drawn on these and other experiences to compile a list
   of indicators that may be used to address sustainability issues
   associated with farm productivity, soil health and catchment health
   identified in recent strategic plans developed for the northern grains
   region of Australia, the focus of this special journal issue.}},

Abstract = {{Two issues prompted this paper. The first was the measured soil organic
   carbon decline in fertile northern Australian soils under continual
   cropping using traditional management practices. We wanted to see
   whether it was theoretically possible to maintain or improve soil
   organic carbon concentrations with modern management recommendations.
   The second was the debate about use of sustainability indicators for
   on-farm management, so we looked at soil organic carbon as a potential
   indicator of soil health and investigated whether it was useful in
   making on-farm crop decisions.
   The analytical results indicated first that theoretically the observed
   decline in soil organic carbon concentrations in some northern cracking
   clay soils can be halted and reversed under continuous cropping
   sequences by using best practice management. Second, the results and
   associated discussion give some support to the use of soil organic
   carbon as a sustainability indicator for soil health. There was a
   consistent correlation between crop input decisions ( fertilisation,
   stubble management, tillage), outputs ( yield and profits) and outcomes
   ( change in soil organic carbon content) in the short and longer term.
   And this relationship depended to some extent on whether the existing
   soil organic carbon status was low, medium or high.
   A stock dynamics relationship is one where the change in a stock ( such
   as soil organic carbon) through time is related not only to the
   management decisions made and other random influences ( such as climatic
   effects), but also to the concentration or level of the stock itself in
   a previous time period. Against such a requirement, soil organic carbon
   was found to be a reasonable measure. However, the inaccuracy in
   measuring soil organic carbon in the paddock mitigates the potential
   benefit shown in this analysis of using soil organic carbon as a
   sustainability indicator.
   These results are based on a simulation model (APSIM) calibrated for a
   cracking clay (Vertosol) soil typical of much of the intensively-cropped
   slopes and plains region of northern New South Wales and southern
   Queensland, and need to be interpreted in this light. There are large
   areas of such soils in north-western New South Wales; however, many of
   these experience lower rainfalls and plant-available soil water
   capacities than in this case, and the importance of these
   characteristics must also be considered.}},

Abstract = {{If farmers are to determine whether their farm goals for resource
   condition are being met, and whether changes in farm management are
   leading towards a more sustainable farming system, then they need to be
   able to monitor these areas. Yet to date, an easy to use, practical and
   reliable method to be used by farmers to monitor trends in soil health
   has not been developed. This has been a consequence mainly of developing
   soil monitoring packages in isolation from the end user, and relying on
   `expert' advice to guide farmers' management of the soil rather than
   empowering them to be more self-reliant in this area. This study sought
   to collaborate with farmers in the development of a soil health
   checklist. The research process acknowledged the importance of local
   conditions, farmers' existing knowledge on soils and their preferences
   for delivery and presentation of the final product. The study focused on
   farmers located in the north-west cropping region of New South Wales,
   Australia. This article reports on a prototype for a farmer's soil
   health checklist - the features they use, how they recognise those
   features, especially the language they use to describe a healthy and
   unhealthy soil, and finally the techniques they use to determine those
   features.}},

Title = {{Effects of grazing and management on herbage mass, persistence, animal

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE}},

Pages = {{875-890}},
Abstract = {{A study was conducted on a native pasture ( dominated by redgrass,
   Bothriochloa macra) in the Barraba district of northern New South Wales
   to examine the effects of 5 grazing treatments on total herbage mass,
   litter mass, basal cover, ground cover, sheep liveweight, wool
   production and soil water content ( SWC, mm) at different depths. Plots
   were grazed with Merino wethers and data were collected from spring 1997
   to spring 2001 and analysed to determine the effects of treatments on
   both production and sustainability. Five grazing treatments were applied
   in a randomised 3 replicate design. Grazing treatments were: continuous
   grazing at 4 and 6 sheep/ha ( C4 and C6), continuous grazing at 8
   sheep/ha, with subterranean clover ( Trifolium subterraneum) oversown
   and fertiliser applied (C8+ sub), and, rotational grazing at an annual
   stocking rate of 4 sheep/ha with pasture grazed for 4 weeks and rested
   for 4 weeks ( R4/ 4), or rested for 12 weeks ( R4/ 12).
   Total herbage mass declined in the C4 ( control) treatment throughout
   the experiment and, compared with this treatment, the C6 treatment had
   less ( P< 0.007) linear trend over time, while the R4/ 12 treatment had
   a greater ( P< 0.001) linear trend. Stocking rates could not be
   maintained in the C4 and C6 treatments and sheep were supplementary fed
   or removed from these treatments for a total of 133 and 263 days,
   respectively. For ground cover, the linear trend was greater ( P< 0.05)
   in the C8+ sub, R4/ 4, and R4/ 12 treatments compared with the
   continuously grazed C4 and C6 treatments and for litter mass this trend
   was also greater ( P< 0.05) for the R4/ 12 treatment than the C4
   treatment. Basal cover of wiregrass (Aristida ramosa), wallaby grass (
   Austrodanthonia spp.) and windmill grass (Chloris truncata) was not
   affected by grazing treatment but for redgrass the linear trend was
   greater ( P< 0.05) in the C8+ sub, R4/ 4, and R4/ 12 treatments compared
   with the C4 and C6 treatments. Sheep liveweight (kg/head) was greater (
   P< 0.001) in the C8+ sub treatment compared with the C4 treatment.
   Annual wool production (kg/head) was also higher ( P< 0.05) in the C8+
   sub treatment compared with all other treatments. Compared with the C4
   treatment, significant differences in soil water content occurred in the
   R4/ 12 and C8+ sub treatments, but these were predicted to be only 2.9
   mm per year for the R4/12 treatment (0 - 30 cm depth) and 5.7 mm per
   year for the C8+ sub treatment ( 30 - 170 cm).
   Use of a biophysical model indicated that evapotranspiration was the
   largest output term in the soil water balance and that both drainage and
   surface runoff of water were episodic events. A sustainability index
   derived from economic ( equivalent annual net return (\$/ha) for a
   10-year period), animal production, pasture, soil health and soil water
   data indicated that the C4 and C6 treatments had the lowest scores for
   each of these parameters and the lowest overall indices. These scores
   were highly correlated with subjective assessments of the impact of the
   treatments (r = 0.93). Overall, these data indicated substantial
   benefits of either rotationally grazing or the addition of fertiliser
   and subterranean clover to the production and sustainability of the
   native pasture studied.}},

Title = {{Effects of grazing and management on herbage mass, persistence, animal
   production and soil water content of native pastures. 2. A mixed native
   pasture, Manilla, North West Slopes, New South Wales}},

Abstract = {{As part of the Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) National Experiment a
   study was conducted on a native pasture in the Manilla district of
   northern New South Wales to examine the effects of 5 grazing treatments
   on total herbage mass, litter mass, basal cover, ground cover, sheep
   liveweight, wool production and soil water content (SWC, mm) at
   different depths. The pasture was a mixture of native perennial grasses,
   with redgrass (Bothriochloa macra) and wiregrass (Aristida ramosa)
   dominant on a red Chromosol soil type and bluegrass (Dichanthium
   sericeum) on a brown Vertosol. Wallaby grasses ( Austrodanthonia
   richardsonii and A. bipartita) were common on both soils. Plots were
   grazed with Merino wethers and data collected from spring 1997 to spring
   2001 were analysed to determine the effect of treatments on both
   production and sustainability. Five grazing treatments were applied in a
   randomised 3 replicate design. Grazing treatments were: continuous
   grazing at 3.1 and 6.2 sheep/ ha (C3 and C6), continuous grazing at 9.2
   sheep/ ha, with subterranean clover ( Trifolium subterraneum) oversown
   and fertiliser applied (C9+ sub) and rotational grazing at an annual
   stocking rate of 3.1 sheep/ ha with pasture grazed for 4 weeks and
   rested for 4 weeks (R4/4), or rested for 12 weeks (R4/12).
   Over time, treatments had no significant effect on either total pasture
   herbage mass ( compared with the C3 control) or the basal cover of the
   major perennial grasses. Treatments had inconsistent significant effects
   on ground cover, litter mass, sheep liveweight and wool production
   (kg/head) over time. Compared with all other treatments ground cover was
   less ( P< 0.05) in the C6 treatment in only May and September 2000 and
   litter mass less ( P< 0.05) in only December 1998 and March 1999.
   Treatment sheep liveweights were not significantly different from the C3
   treatment from September 1997 to 1999. However, from October 1999 to
   October 2001 sheep liveweight in the C6 treatment was significantly less
   than in the C3 treatment, while in the C9+ sub and R4/12 treatments it
   was significantly greater than the control. In 1999, wool production per
   head was higher ( P< 0.05) in the C9+ sub and R4/12 treatments compared
   with all other treatments but treatment differences were not significant
   in all other years. Significant differences in SWC only occurred at the
   0 - 30 cm depth between the C3 and the C6 and R4/12 treatments, but were
   predicted to be < 1.5 mm/year. A sustainability index derived from
   economic {[} equivalent annual net return (\$/ha) for a 10-year period],
   animal production, pasture, soil health and soil water data indicated
   that the overall indices were lowest for the C3, C6 and C9+ sub
   treatments and highest for the R4/4 and R4/12 treatments.}},

Abstract = {{An ethnoecological study was carried out in the Purhepecha community of
   San Francisco Pichataro, west central Mexico, with the purpose of
   investigating how land degradation, in terms of soil erosion and
   fertility depletion, was (and still is) handled by indigenous farmers so
   that traditional agriculture could remain sustainable over centuries.
   After briefly reviewing opposite views on the land degradation issue in
   the regional context of the Patzcuaro lake basin, the paper focuses on
   land management at local level. The indigenous concept of land is
   discussed as an integrated whole, including water cycle, climate, relief
   and soils. Indigenous people venerate land as the mother of all living
   beings, including humans. Therefore, people's health and survival
   require good land care and management. Local knowledge on land
   management is organized around four basic principles: land position,
   land behaviour, land resilience and land quality. Farmers recognize land
   as a dynamic subject, a concept reflected in the expression `land moves
   and behaves'. Soil erosion and fertility depletion are perceived as
   `normal' processes the farmers control by means of integrated management
   practices. Farmers recognize several land classes, primarily controlled
   by landscape position, which require different land care. The example of
   San Francisco Pichataro demonstrates that traditional agriculture does
   not necessarily lead to land degradation. But the collective knowledge,
   or social theory, on land management is increasingly exposed to be
   fragmented as the community undergoes structural changes and loses its
   social cohesion under the pressure of externalities such as off-farm
   activities, out-migrations and governmental intervention, among others.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in soil quality and health has grown with awareness that soil
   is vital to life on earth both in production of food and fiber and
   global ecosystems function and environmental stability. Agriculture
   needs economic soil management practices that provide sufficient food
   and fiber yet maintain environmental stability, ecological integrity,
   and the quality of essential soil, water, and air resources. Our journey
   towards sustainable land management starts with identification of our
   final destination or goals, the strategies or course by which we will
   get there, and the indicators that we are going the right direction.
   Strategies for sustainable management include conserving soil organic
   matter, minimizing erosion, balancing production with environmental
   needs, and making better use of renewable resources. In this regard,
   soil health is a major indicator of sustainable management. Criteria for
   indicators of soil health relate mainly to their utility in defining
   ecosystem processes and integrating physical, chemical, and biological
   properties; their sensitivity to management and climatic variations; and
   their accessibility and utility to agricultural specialists, producers,
   conservationists, and policy makers. Although soils have inherent
   quality as related to their physical, chemical, and biological
   properties within climate and ecosystem boundaries, the ultimate
   determinant of soil quality and health is the land manager. As such, the
   assessment of soil quality or health, and direction of change with time,
   is the primary indicator of sustainable management and environmental
   remediation. Examples are given of approaches for assessing soil health
   to define the economic and environmental sustainability of land
   management practices and to `translate our science into practice'.}},

Abstract = {{This work proposes a new potential application of waste coal fly ash as
   a K fertilizer support. Fly ash was reacted with KOH to facilitate the
   impregnation of K as well as to enhance the bonding force. In
   particular, the applied process resulted in a significant slow-releasing
   characteristic of fertilizer elements. To examine the effect of K
   impregnation, a few detailed leaching tests were carried out in terms of
   process variables such as reaction time and temperature, sintering time
   and temperature, and KOH concentration. The current experiment presented
   an optimum preparation condition that is competitive with conventional
   commercial fertilizers. The manufactured ash fertilizers inhibited
   release of the K elements. It was also found through the continuous
   leaching test with pure water that the ash fertilizer had excellent
   moisture absorbability. However, the effects of some trace elements in
   fly ash on soil health and crop productivity as well as environmental
   considerations need to be established with long-term studies.}},

Abstract = {{Cadmium (Cd) inputs and losses from agricultural soils are of great
   importance because of the potential adverse effects Cd can pose to food
   quality, soil health and the environment in general. One important
   pathway for Cd losses from soil systems is by leaching. We investigated
   loss of Cd from a range of contrasting New Zealand pasture soils that
   had received Cd predominantly from repeated applications of phosphate
   fertilizer. Annual leaching losses of Cd ranged between 0.27 and 0.86 g
   ha(-l) , which are less than most losses recorded elsewhere. These
   losses equate to between 5 and 15\% of the Cd added to soil through a
   typical annual application of single superphosphate, which in New
   Zealand contains on average 280 mg Cd kg(-1) P. It appears that Cd added
   to soil from phosphate fertilizer is fairly immobile and Cd tends to
   accumulate in the topsoil. The pH of the leachate and the total volume
   of drainage to some extent control the amount of Cd leached. Additional
   factors, such as the soil sorption capacity, are also important in
   controlling Cd movement in these pasture soils. The prediction of the
   amount of Cd leached using the measured concentrations of Cd in the soil
   solution and rainfall data resulted in an overestimation of Cd losses.
   Cadmium concentrations in drainage water are substantially less than the
   current maximum acceptable value of 3 mug l(-1) for drinking water in
   New Zealand set by the Ministry of Health.}},

Abstract = {{An assessment of the biodiversity of soils was a component of the
   Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000). This was the first integrated survey
   of soil biota and chemical properties at a national scale. A total of
   1052 soil samples were collected across Great Britain during CS2000 and
   analysed for a range of soil microbial and invertebrate characteristics
   resulting in the production of a series of robust datasets. A principal
   objective was to use these datasets to investigate relationships between
   soil biota and environmental factors such as geographical location,
   vegetation. land use, land cover, soil type and pollutant levels as
   first stages in characterising the inherent biodiversity of British
   soils and investigating the potential of soil biodiversity as indicators
   of soil health at a regional or national scale. Preliminary results for
   culturable heterotrophic, invertebrate taxa, Acari, Collembola and
   Oribatid mites are presented here to illustrate the nature of the data
   collected and the patterns of soil biodiversity in relation to
   large-scale regional, vegetation and soil characteristics across the
   British countryside. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the extent to which farmers have improved food production in
   recent years with low cost, locally available and environmentally
   sensitive practices and technologies. We analysed by survey during
   1999-2000 208 projects in 52 developing countries, in which 8.98 million
   farmers have adopted these practices and technologies on 28.92 million
   hectares, representing 3.0\% of the 960 million hectares of arable and
   permanent crops in Africa, Asia and Latin America. We found improvements
   in food production occurring through one or more of four mechanisms: (i)
   intensification of a single component of farm system; (ii) addition of a
   new productive element to a farm system; (iii) better use of water and
   land, so increasing cropping intensity; (iv) improvements in per hectare
   yields of staples through introduction of new regenerative elements into
   farm systems and new locally appropriate crop varieties and animal
   breeds. The 89 projects with reliable yield data show an average per
   project increase in per hectare food production of 93\%. The weighted
   average increases across these projects were 37\% per farm and 48\% per
   hectare. In the 80 projects with small (<5 ha) farms where cereals were
   the main staples, the 4.42 million farms on 3.58 million hectares
   increased household food production by 1.71 t per year. We report on the
   practices and technologies that have led to these increases: increased
   water use efficiency, improvements to soil health and fertility, and
   pest control with minimal or zero-pesticide use. This research reveals
   promising advances in the adoption of practices and technologies that
   are likely to be more sustainable, with substantial benefits for the
   rural poor. With further explicit support, particularly through national
   policy reforms and better markets, these improvements in food security
   could spread to much larger numbers of farmers and rural people in the
   coming decades. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Properties of a claim loam soil, collected in Aranjuez (Madrid) and
   enriched with organic matter and microorganisms, were evaluated under
   controlled temperature and moisture conditions, over a period of three
   months. The following treatments were carried out: soil (control); soil
   + 50 t ha(-1) of animal manure (E50); soil + 50 t ha(-1) of animal
   manure + 30 L ha-1 of effective microorganisms (E50EM); soil + 30 t
   ha(-1) of the combination of various green crop residues and weeds
   (RC30) and soil + 30 t ha(-1) of the combination of various green crop
   residues and weeds + 30 L ha(-1) of effective microorganisms (RC30EM).
   Soil samples were taken before and after incubation and their physical,
   chemical, and microbiological parameters analyzed. Significant increase
   was observed in the production of exopolysaccharides and basic
   phosphatase and esterase enzyme activities in the treatments E50EM and
   RC30EM, in correlation with the humification of organic matter, water
   retention at field capacity, and the cationic exchange capacity (CEC) of
   the same treatments. The conclusion was drawn that the incorporation of
   a mixture of effective microorganisms (EM) intensified the biological
   soil activity and improved physical and chemical soil properties,
   contributing to a quick humification of fresh organic. matter. These
   findings were illustrated by the microbiological activities of
   exopolysaccharides and by alkaline phosphatase and esterase enzymes,
   which can be used as early and integrated soil health indicators.}},

Abstract = {{The soil quality concept evolved throughout the 1990s in response to
   increased global emphasis on sustainable land use and with a holistic
   focus emphasizing that sustainable soil management requires more than
   soil erosion control. The concept includes two areas of
   emphasis-education and assessment-both based soundly on principles of
   soil science. Soil quality test kits, farmer-based scorecards, visual
   assessment procedures, fact sheets, and video presentations were
   developed as educational materials because many people have no basis to
   recognize, understand or appreciate the complexity of soil resources.
   Assessment tools for indexing soil quality at various scales were
   pursued to show the multiple functions (e.g. nutrient and water cycling,
   filtering and buffering of contaminants, decomposition of crop residues
   and other organic matter sources, and recycling of essential plant
   nutrients) that soils provide as the foundation for sustainable land
   management. Worldwide research and technology transfer efforts have
   increased awareness that soil resources have both inherent
   characteristics determined by their basic soil formation factors and
   dynamic characteristics influenced by human decisions and management
   practices. Soil quality assessment and education are intended to provide
   a better understanding and awareness that soil resources are truly
   living bodies with biological, chemical, and physical properties and
   processes performing essential ecosystem services. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nematode community analysis may provide a useful tool to quantify soil
   health. Nematode communities were monitored for 5 years during a 12-year
   period in the sustainable agriculture fanning systems (SAFS) project at
   UC Davis, where conventional (CONV), low-input (LOW) and organic (ORG)
   management treatments were compared. After the completion of three
   4-year crop rotation cycles, a uniform crop of oats was grown in 2001.
   The composition of the nematode genera was different from year to year,
   but there were significant management effects on genus composition in
   each year, with the CONV treatment being significantly different from
   the LOW and ORG treatments. Important contributors to the differences in
   genus composition among treatments were plant parasitic nematodes.
   Nematode community indices (enrichment (EI), basal (131) and channel
   (CI) indices) of the CONV treatment differed from those of the ORG and
   LOW treatments in 1993, 1994, 1995 and 2000, but not in 2001. The
   difference in structure index (SI) among management treatments was
   significant in 1995 and 2000. El and SI were generally lower, and 131
   and Cl higher in CONV than in LOW and ORG treatments. There were
   significant crop effects on the community indices throughout the years.
   Even in 200 1, there was a residual effect of the crop grown in 2000 on
   most nematode community indices. Differences in El, BI and C-I among
   crops were consistent, while those in SI were not. Meloidogyne javanica
   (Treub) Chitwood, juveniles added to various soil samples were reduced
   by 68\% in soil where nematode trapping fungi had been added and which
   had low BI (12) and low CI (20) values. Soil from SAFS plots with a high
   BI (47) and high CI (70) after I year of oats and ploughing, suppressed
   root knot juveniles much less. There were significant negative
   correlations between BI and root knot nematode (RKN) suppression (-0.72)
   and between CI and RKN suppression (-0.74). Thus, BI and Cl appeared to
   be most valuable as indicators for long-term effects of management on
   nematode suppression. However, BI and SI may be more suitable as general
   indicators for the health status of a soil, since Cl can be high in
   highly disturbed agro-ecosystems as well as in undisturbed natural
   ecosystems. A high BI would indicate poor ecosystem health, while a high
   SI would indicate a well-regulated, healthy ecosystem. For agricultural
   soils the presence of large populations of plant parasitic nematodes
   forms an additional indication of poor ecosystem health, as natural
   regulation is limited in this case. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Microbial characteristics of soil are being evaluated increasingly as
   sensitive indicators of soil health because of the clear relationship
   between microbial diversity, soil and plant quality and ecosystem
   sustainability. This study aimed to determine microbial carbon biomass
   and microbial abundance after fire to estimate the degree of damage,
   including the rate of recovery of micro-organisms, in each area. The
   study also aimed to establish relationships between microbial biomass
   and microbial abundance and the physico-chemical properties of the soil.
   The study was conducted in three different study areas in Hiroshima
   prefecture, one unburned area and two burnt areas (one immediately after
   and one 2 years after fire). anova showed a significant difference in
   microbial carbon biomass and microbial abundance among the study areas.
   Microbial carbon biomass and microbial abundance were highest in the
   unburned area, followed by the area burnt 2 years ago and lastly by the
   area studied immediately after fire. Carbon biomass was highly
   correlated with microbial abundance (r(2) = 0.950). Carbon biomass and
   microbial abundance were shown to be significantly correlated to the
   soil's physico-chemical properties, such as pH, moisture content,
   water-holding capacity and carbon : nitrogen (C : N) ratio. However, the
   C : N ratio was closely correlated to both carbon biomass and microbial
   abundance with r(2) = 0.705 (P < 0.01) and r(2) = 0.560 (P < 0.01),
   respectively.}},

   have increased exponentially throughout the world. Educational and

   evaluating and understanding the effects of soil management on a
   specific soil resource. The approaches have stressed that to determine
   how well a soil is functioning, inherent and dynamic soil properties and
   processes must be evaluated using biological, chemical, and physical

Abstract = {{Soil quality is a concept that has deeply divided the soil science
   community. It has been institutionalized and advocated without full
   consideration of concept weaknesses and contradictions. Our paper
   highlights its disfunctional definition, flawed approach to
   quantification, and failure to integrate simultaneous functions, which
   often require contradictory soil properties and/or management. While the
   concept arose from a call to protect the environment and sustain the
   soil resource, soil quality indexing as implemented may actually impair
   some soil functions, environmental quality, or other societal
   priorities. We offer the alternative view that emphasis on known
   principles of soil management is a better expenditure of limited
   resources for soil stewardship than developing and deploying subjective
   indices which fait to integrate across the necessary spectrum of
   management outcomes. If the soil quality concept is retained, we suggest
   precisely specifying soil use, not function or capacity, as the criteria
   for attribute evaluation. Emphasis should be directed toward using
   available technical information to motivate and educate farmers on
   management practices that optimize the combined goals of high crop
   production, low environmental degradation, and a sustained resource.}},

   detrimental soil biota associated with yield decline of sugarcane in
   Queensland, Australia}},
Journal = {{SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Yield decline (YD) of sugarcane is a widespread problem throughout the
   Australian sugar industry. It is defined as ``the loss of productive
   capacity of sugarcane-growing soil under long-term monoculture{''}.
   Factors contributing to YD are the monoculture itself. excessive tillage
   of the soil at planting and severe soil compaction resulting from the
   use of heavy machinery during the harvesting operation. Collectively,
   these crop management practices have led to the development of
   sugarcane-growing soils that are low in organic C and cation exchange
   capacity, have a high bulk density and have a low microbial biomass.
   This in turn is associated with a build up of populations of detrimental
   soil organisms, which affect the growth and health of the suaarcane root
   system. Significant yield increases have been demonstrated following
   pasteurization or fumigation of the soil or treatment of the soil with
   fungicides or nematicides. Several detrimental soil organisms associated
   with YD have been identified, including a fungal root pathogen
   (Pachymetra chaunorhiza) and the lesion nematode (Pratylenchus zeae).
   Experimental evidence, however, suggests there are many other
   unidentified detrimental soil organisms associated with YD.
   In order to circumvent YD, major changes to the cane cropping system
   need to be considered. Different rotation breaks (sown pasture,
   alternate crops, bare fallow) were evaluated for their impact on soil
   health and the composition of the community of organisms in soil
   previously under cane monoculture. Despite the breaks having different
   effects on populations of beneficial soil biota, all breaks reduced
   populations of known detrimental soil biota and significantly increased
   the yield of the following cane crop. A single legume-based break crop
   appeared to be sufficient to capture the majority of these benefits.
   Other possible management options including the use of organic
   amendments and minimum tillage techniques are discussed. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Crop rotation effects, due to emerging soil ecological interactions and
   processes that occur with time, can have a major impact on crop
   productivity and soil health. 2-year potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)
   rotation studies were conducted during an 11-year period on a fine sandy
   loam (Orthic Podzol) under a cool, humid climate in Prince Edward Island
   in eastern Canada. Rotation partners included Italian ryegrass (Lolium
   multiflorum Lam.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and barley
   (Hordeum vulgare L.). The study objective was to assess trends in yield
   parameters, populations and diversity in nematodes and soil-borne
   pathogens, and soil structural stability and organic matter retention
   with time. Italian ryegrass had the largest biomass of both herbage (6.5
   Mg ha(-1)) and roots (4.8 Mg ha(-1)), compared to red clover or barley.
   Averaged across 9 years, potato tuber yield was highest under Italian
   ryegrass (35.0 Mg ha(-1)) and lowest under red clover (31.1 Mg ha(-1))
   rotations. Differences in tuber yield among rotations was associated
   with soil N limitation and nematode activity, but was not evident until
   Year 6. Population densities of specific plant parasitic nematodes
   recovered from roots and soil were generally low and varied according to
   host plant. Root lesion (Protylenchus spp.) and root-knot (Meloidogyne
   spp.) nematodes were more prevalent under red clover compared to other
   rotational crops. Stunt (Merlinius spp. and Tylenchorhynchus spp.)
   nematodes were more common under Italian ryegrass. The main organisms
   associated with tuber-borne disease were Rhizoctonia solani,
   Streptomyces spp., Fusarium spp., and Helminthosporium solani. The
   greatest reduction in tuber-borne diseases occurred with the potato-red
   clover rotation but significant differences were infrequent. Soil
   structural form throughout the soil profile (to 30 cm depth) was not
   adversely affected by the rotational treatments during the duration of
   the study, while soil structural stability at the soil surface (0-10 cm)
   was significantly improved. Losses of soil organic C, during the 11-year
   period ranged from marginal (4\%) for rotations with Italian ryegrass,
   to significant (16\%) under the barley rotation. Computer simulations,
   using the Century model, illustrated the importance of C inputs to
   maintain soil organic matter levels. Overall, potato crop productivity
   and soil organic C were generally maintained in rotations that contained
   Italian ryegrass, but declined under rotations with red clover and
   barley. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in agricultural practices with time have led to a decline in
   soil structure and with it, an increase in soil-borne plant diseases.
   Agricultural practices such as incorporating organic amendments and
   managing the type and quantity of crop residue, have a direct impact on
   plant health and crop productivity. Soil management practices involving
   tillage, rotation, and burning will impact the amount and quality of
   organic matter that is returned to the soil. These practices influence
   pathogen viability and distribution, nutrient availability, and the
   release of biologically active substances from both crop residues and
   soil microorganisms as illustrated by the model system of Cochliobolus
   sativus on the development of common root rot in cereals. The
   application of organic amendments, manures and composts that are rich in
   nitrogen, may reduce soil-borne diseases by releasing allelochemicals
   generated during product storage or by subsequent microbial
   decomposition. The modes of action for disease suppression are
   elucidated for a number of diseases including verticillium wilt and
   common scab of potato. Developing disease suppressive soils by
   introducing organic amendments and crop residue management takes time,
   but the benefits accumulate across successive years improving soil
   health and structure. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Interactions between the diversity of primary producers (plants) and of
   decomposers (microbes and mesofaunal communities), the two key
   functional groups that form the basis of all ecosystems have major
   consequences on the functioning of agricultural ecosystems. Soil
   microorganisms control the transformation and mineralization of natural
   compounds and xenobiotics. The soil microbiota, existing in extremely
   high density and diversity, rapidly modify the energetic performance and
   activity rates to changing environmental conditions. Thus, the microbial
   consortium possesses the ability to accommodate environmental
   constraints by adjusting (i) activity rates, (ii) biomass, and (iii)
   community structure. These parameters are particularly important to take
   into consideration when evaluating soil quality. The present paper gives
   an overview about the possibilities to use bacterial and fungal
   populations as an indicator for soil quality. Furthermore also the
   applicability of nematodes for the determination of soil health will be
   discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cropping systems influence the ecology of agricultural soils. The
   effects of crop rotation and N fertilization on the activities of four
   amidohydrolases (amidase, L-asparaginase, L-aspartase, and
   L-glutaminase) were studied in soils of two long-term cropping systems
   in Iowa: the Northeast Research Center (NERC) and the Clarion-Webster
   Research Center (CWRC) that were initiated in 1979 and 1954,
   respectively, and sampled in 1996 and 1997. Multicropping systems,
   especially meadow-oat-based systems, enhanced the activities of the
   amidohydrolases; monocropping systems, involving corn or soybean,
   reduced the activities of the four enzymes. Analysis of variance
   indicated that activities of the amidohydrolases were significantly
   affected by cropping systems at the NERC site in both years; but only
   amidase activity was significantly affected by N fertilization. With the
   exception of amidase, the activities of the other three enzymes were not
   affected by cropping systems and N fertilization in the soils at the
   CWRC site. The activities of the four amidohydrolases were significantly
   correlated with soil microbial carbon (C(mic)) (r > 0.447 and r > 0.398,
   P < 0.01), soil microbial nitrogen (N(mic)) (r > 0.445, P < 0.01 and r >
   0.596, P < 0.001), and the amount of N mineralized in 24 weeks of
   incubation at 30degreesC (r > 0.427 and r > 0.467, P < 0.05) in soils of
   the CWRC and NERC sites, respectively. The specific activities of the
   four enzymes in soils under multicropping systems were greater than
   those under monocropping systems. The results suggest that the
   mineralization of organic N in the soil is mediated by microbial biomass
   through the action of these enzymes, and that the activities of the
   amidohydrolases can be used to predict N mineralization and monitor soil
   health and quality. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Field experiments were carried out during 1996-97 at Gulawathi, Muthiani
   and Salarpur Villages, IARI Farm, New Delhi and NCPP Campus, Dadri to
   evaluate changes in soil characteristics and growth of wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L.), mustard (Brassica juncea L.), lentil (Lence esculenta
   Moench.), rice (Oryza sativa L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) by varying
   amounts of flyash addition (up to 50t ha(-1)) in soils at
   sowing/transplanting time of crops. Flyash addition in areas adjoining
   NCPP Thermal Power Plant, Dadri, Ghaziabad, U. P. ranged from 5-12 t
   ha(-1) yr(-1) in 1995-96. Shoot and root growth and yield of test crops
   at different locations after flyash incorporation resulted in beneficial
   effects of flyash addition in most cases. The silt dominant texture of
   flyash improved loamy sand to sandy loam textures of the surface soils
   at the farmers' fields. The increased growth in yield of crops with
   flyash incorporation was possibly due to modifications in soil moisture
   retention and transmission characteristics, bulk density,
   physico-chemical characters such as pH and EC and organic carbon
   content. The response of flyash addition in the soil on soil health and
   crop productivity needs to be evaluated on long-term sustainable
   aspects.}},

Abstract = {{In high productivity zones of the Indo-Gangetic Plain Region (IGPR) of
   India, the rice-wheat cropping system (RWCS) is exhibiting a decline in
   factor productivity, low N use-efficiency and deterioration in soil
   health. Inclusion of legumes in RWCS is advocated as one of the
   promising agro-techniques to sustain productivity. A field experiment
   was conducted during 1996/97 and 1997/98 on sandy loam (Typic
   Ustrochrept) soil of Modipuram, India (29degrees4'N, 77degrees46'E, 237
   m above sea level) to explore the possibilities of inclusion of cowpea
   as a break crop in RWCS. The effect of rice or cowpea was measured on
   the yield, fertilizer N requirement and N use-efficiency in wheat, and
   also on the soil organic carbon and available N content. The yields of
   wheat following cowpea were significantly (P<0.05) greater by 19-20\%,
   compared with those following rice. In a cowpea-wheat rotation economic
   optimum dose of fertilizer N for wheat was smaller than that in a
   rice-wheat rotation due to increased N availability, better growing
   environment and greater N use-efficiency (measured as agronomic
   efficiency, apparent recovery and partial factor productivity) in the
   former case. On termination of the experiment, soil organic carbon and
   available N content increased over initial content with increasing rates
   of fertilizer N under both rotations, but the magnitude of increase was
   greater in treatments where cowpea preceded wheat.}},

Abstract = {{Field trials were conducted in and area of Pakistan with wheat-cotton
   rotation to evaluate the potential use of brackish drainage effluent for
   soil reclamation and crop production. The original drainage effluent was
   diluted with canal water before application. The treatments included:
   simple leaching with marginal water (electrical conductivity (EC) 1.25
   dS m(-1)) without growing crop; irrigation with saline water (EC 2.25 dS
   m(-1)) alone; irrigation with saline water and green manure; and
   irrigation with saline water and farmyard manure. The changes in
   infiltration rate, soil salinity and sodicity along with crop yield were
   recorded. Maximum improvement of 88.9\% was recorded in infiltration
   rate with green and farmyard manure application. In case of soil
   salinity and sodicity, the highest decrease of 2.8 and 41.3\% was
   recorded with farmyard manure and an increase of 39.2 and 14.9\% with
   simple leaching at 0-15 cm depth. At other three sampling depths, all
   treatments significantly increased EC of soil. Whereas sodium absorption
   ratio increased only at the lowest depth (60-90 cm) under all
   treatments. The application of farmyard manure produced the highest
   wheat and cotton yield with an average of 1925 and 1485 kg ha(-1),
   respectively. The overall results showed that the application of
   farmyard manure was comparatively more effective than other treatments
   in overcoming the adverse effects of irrigation with poor quality water.
   However, the use of farmyard manure with drainage effluent is
   recommended under acute shortage of irrigation water. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Bacterial species employ complex communication mechanisms termed
   quorum-sensing (QS) that link cell density with gene expression. In this
   process diffusible signal molecules, autoinducers like acyl-homoserine
   lactones, accumulate in the extracellular environment, attain a critical
   threshold concentration and trigger the response which leads to gene
   expression. Besides operation of QS in the rhizosphere, it is apparent
   that some cross-talk between bacterial forms also occurs: plant
   growth-promoting bacteria such as pseudomonads, bacilli, etc. can
   influence the operation of QS systems in plant pathogenic forms. At
   threshold cell-density level, bacteria produce substances that inhibit
   proliferation of pathogens; beneficial bacteria responsible for nitrogen
   fixation on the other hand, use QS to optimize nodule formation on plant
   roots. Further advancement and finer understanding of QS in the
   rhizosphere will facilitate sustained exploitation of bioinoculants in
   soil health, plant productivity, bioremediation strategies in
   environmental applications and operation of biodegradation mechanisms
   that often determine the fate of a microorganism introduced in the
   natural ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Effluent was applied at six rates (0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 mm) in
   November following silage harvesting, with pasture being monitored for
   dry matter (DM) yield and changes in nutritive characteristics and
   mineral content from November to April. The effluent contained high
   levels of potassium (K) (445 kg/ML) and sodium (Na) (508 kg/ML) and
   moderate levels of nitrogen (N) (155 ka/ML) and phosphorus (P) (23
   kg/ML). With effluent, irrespective of rate, DM yields at the first
   grazing (27 November) were higher (P < 0.05) than the control (0 mm).
   When effluent was applied at rates of 60 and 75 mm, DM yields were
   higher (P < 0.05) than for all other effluent treatments. At the second
   grazing (17 December), effluent at 30mm and above resulted in higher (P
   < 0.05) DM yields than the control. Pasture crude protein (CP) was
   higher than control (P < 0.05) at the first grazing where effluent had
   been applied at 30 mm and higher, whilst by the second grazing this
   effect was only apparent at rates of 60 and 75 mm. The concentration of
   K at the first grazing was higher (P < 0.05) when effluent was applied,
   whilst both P and Na concentration were higher (P < 0.05) at rates of 30
   mm or higher than control. There was no effect of effluent on either DM
   yield or nutritive characteristics for the third (27 February) and
   fourth (11 April) grazings. This study indicates the potential for using
   dairy effluent to increase pasture DM yield during late spring and
   summer in dryland areas of southern Victoria. Further research is
   required to determine the longer impacts of dairy effluent use on
   pasture composition and environmental factors such as soil health.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing interest has emerged with respect to the importance of
   microbial diversity in soil habitats. The extent of the diversity of
   microorganisms in soil is seen to be critical to the maintenance of soil
   health and quality, as a wide range of microorganisms is involved in
   important soil functions. This review focuses on recent data relating
   how plant type, soil type, and soil management regime affect the
   microbial diversity of soil and the implication for the soil's disease
   suppressiveness. The two main drivers of soil microbial community
   structure, i.e., plant type and soil type, are thought to exert their
   function in a complex manner. We propose that the fact that in some
   situations the soil and in others the plant type is the key factor
   determining soil microbial diversity is related to the complexity of the
   microbial interactions in soil, including interactions between
   microorganisms and soil and microorganisms and plants. A conceptual
   framework, based on the relative strengths of the shaping forces exerted
   by plant and soil versus the ecological behavior of microorganisms, is
   proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the results obtained from the lab scale study, pilot scale
   experiments were conducted on the use of 15-25\% ie. 300 to 650 MT
   ha(-1) (metric tonnes per hectare of land) of coal ash to increase the
   agricultural productivity of sandy, silty clay loam and clayey soil of
   wasteland located at different parts of India. The present work is an
   attempt to evaluate the contribution of coal ash addition to these soils
   in terms of heavy metal loading through fungal invasion via ergosterol
   estimation in sequestering the heavy metals.
   The ergosterol estimation was done by HPLC. Ergosterol was eluted at 8
   min after injecting of 20 mul of the extract. An increased content of
   ergosterol with increased concentration of coal ash is noticed, which is
   influenced by the sample moisture content, thus freeze-dried samples
   have 25\% more ergosterol content. Statistically significant results
   were obtained with freeze-dried soil samples with 25\% coal ash addition
   on sandy soil (p < 0.05), while with silty clay loam or clayey soil and
   20\% or 15\% coal ash application, respectively, significant results at
   p < 0.05 were obtained with Farm Yard Manure (FYM). Soil amended with
   coal ash addition showed an increase in concentration of heavy metals
   and trace elements with higher dose of coal ash treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Rice-wheat yields in many parts of India are stagnant. The main reason
   for this is conventional blanket fertilizer recommendation, lower
   fertilizer use efficiency and imbalanced use of fertilizers. Estimation
   of fertilizer requirements based on quantitative approaches can assist
   in improving rice-wheat yields, soil health and increasing nutrient use
   efficiency vis-a-vis reduce soil erosion. We used the QUEFTS (
   QUantitative Evaluation of Fertility of Tropical Soils)model for
   estimation of nitrogen(N), phosphorus(P) and potassium( K) requirements
   and fertilizer recommendations for achieving a target yield of rice and
   wheat considering improvement of soil health, climatic potential yield
   and minimization of soil erosion under irrigated ecosystem. The
   experiments were conducted in 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 in ten sites(
   Farmer's field) in the state of West Bengal by taking rice ( cv.
   IET4094) and wheat( cv. UP-262) as a test crop. The required N, P and K
   accumulation in the plant for I tonne grain yield of rice and wheat were
   8.8 and 15.8, 2.7 and 3.2, 18.3 and 28.4kg, respectively, suggesting an
   average NPK ratio in the plant dry matter of about 3.26: 1: 6 78 for
   rice and 4.94: 1: 8.88 for wheat. The constants for minimum(a) and
   maximum(d) accumulation(kg grain . kg(-1)) of rice were; N(66 and 166),
   P(202 and 565) and K(35 and 73). The corresponding values of a and d of
   wheat were; N(37 and 96), P( 144 and 652) and K(21 and 52) respectively.
   These values were derived as the standard model parameters in QUEFTS for
   fertilizer recommendation for irrigated rice-wheat considering soil
   health and minimization of soil erosion in the tropical and subtropical
   regions of India. The observed yields of rice and wheat with different
   amounts of these nutrients were in good agreement with the values
   predicted by the model, indicating that the model can be used for
   fertilizer recommendations under all conditions. After knowing the
   fertility status and fertilizer recommendations, nutrient use efficiency
   can be increased by minimizing soil erosion under rice-wheat irrigated
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{As a potential means of monitoring functional properties of plantations
   of Pinus pinaster and Pinus radiata established as part of land
   rehabilitation in the wheatbelt of Western Australia, we examined
   aspects of the ecophysiology of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with
   tree roots. A single species of ectomycorrhizal fungi, Rhizopogon
   roseolus, dominated the mycorrhizal flora. Sporocarps of Rhizopogon
   roseolus appeared with the onset of winter rains in May, increased in
   number and total biomass to peak in September, and decreased to
   negligible levels at the beginning of the summer drought in December. A
   greater number of sporocarps, and consequently a greater biomass of
   sporocarp tissue, was associated with roots of P. radiata than P.
   pinaster. A similar seasonal pattern of rnycorrhizal root infection was
   determined by counts of individual ectomycorrhizal root tips from
   bimonthly collection of soil core samples. At the low rainfall (380 mm
   annually) site, greater numbers of live root tips were more strongly
   correlated with soil moisture than organic matter content of soil. In
   contrast, in wetter areas closer to Perth (800 mm annually), highest
   numbers of active root tips and greatest amounts of organic matter were
   both within 0-10 cm depths. Results suggest an overriding importance of
   soil moisture rather than nutrient status of the soil as the key
   determinant of spatial and temporal distribution of the fungus. Results
   from a range of assays determining enzyme activity of soil (protease,
   phosphomonoesterase, cellulase, L-asparaginase, L-glutaminase and
   beta-glucosidase) Surrounding mycorrhizal roots indicated seasonal
   patterns to be similar to those described for reproductive activity of
   mycorrhizal fungi. Factors responsible for patterns of seasonal activity
   and distribution of ectomycorrhizal roots are discussed in terms of
   managing systems in order to maximise tree growth and form while
   effectively restoring soil water balance.}},

Abstract = {{Organic farming largely excludes the use of synthetic farm chemicals
   which are replaced with organic inputs and biologically active
   formulations. In order to market any produce as ``organic{''},
   certification is necessary from competent authorities, taking into
   consideration the system of raising the crop. Hence ``organic{''} is a
   process claim than a product claim. Mango appears to be amenable for
   organic farming. Perennial fruit crops with their large framework and
   huge dry matter built-up over the years, meet a large part of their
   current nutrient requirements for growth and development through
   internal mobilization of vast reserve of nutrients. Mango being a
   perennial fruit crop with a large framework seems even less dependent on
   chemical fertilizers than many other fruit crops and its current
   nutrient requirement can be met by recycling of its plant residues by
   vermiculture, organic manures and biofertilizers. Biological control
   methods for managing some pests and diseases are available.
   Chemical-free postharvest treatments are in vogue in mango. However,
   more location-specific research efforts would be required on some of
   these aspects in order to achieve sustainable high yields.}},

Abstract = {{The enzyme status of soil influences mineralization kinetics, and thus,
   the supply of nutrients to plants. We quantified urease, asparaginase,
   glutaminase, phosphatase, and arylsulfatase activity in a
   sagebrush/grass ecosystem northeast of Reno, NV. Enzyme activity was
   evaluated by depth (0 to 5 cm, 5 to 10 cm, 10 to 20 cm), microsite
   (sagebrush, crested wheatgrass, cheatgrass, cryptogamic crust in shrub
   interspace, noncryptogamic crust in shrub interspace), and treatment
   (grazed and ungrazed). For most enzymes evaluated, there was a
   significant depth x microsite interaction. In general, enzyme activity
   declined with depth. Moreover, the noncryptogamic interspace microsite
   often had the lowest enzyme activity among the other microsites.
   Depending on soil depth and microsite, the grazing treatment
   significantly reduced urease, asparaginase, and alkaline phosphatase
   activity compared to the ungrazed treatment. Enzyme activity is an
   important soil attribute and may serve as a robust measure of soil
   health.}},

   interest in soybeans in Australia. This papers reviews how soybeans are
   being utilised in three farming systems in Australia that are dominated
   by sugarcane, perennial pasture and rice. The farming systems, termed
   tropical coastal sugarcane, subtropical coastal beef and Murrumbidgee
   irrigated have had complete or extended periods of monoculture.
   Resultant soil health and disease problems have caused yield decline
   comparatively to uncultivated soil. Soybeans are an attractive
   ``break{''} crop that is being used for green manure or grain
   production. As a grain crop it can provide an alternative income to
   subsidise the cost of land improvement techniques. With the adoption of
   no-till techniques establishment costs are reduced, crop frequency
   increased and land sustainability improved.}},

Abstract = {{The soil of a coastal Mexican refinery is quite contaminated, especially
   by hydrocarbons, with detected concentrations up to 130 000 mg kg(-1) as
   TPHs (total petroleum hydrocarbons). The main sources of contamination
   are pipelines, valves, and old storage tanks, besides the land disposal
   of untreated hydrocarbon sediments derived from the cleaning of storage
   tanks. A health risk assessment (HRA) was carried out in order to
   measure the risk hazard indexes and clean-up standards for the refinery
   soil. HRA suggested the following actions to be taken: benzene
   concentrations must be reduced in eight of the 16 studied refinery zones
   to 0.0074-0.0078 mg kg(-1). Also, vanadium concentration must be reduced
   in two zones up to a concentration of 100 mg kg(-1). In only one of all
   of the studied zones, benzo(a) pyrene concentration must be reduced to
   0.1 mg kg(-1). After 1 yr, TPHs showed a diminution of about 52\%. Even
   though TPHs concentrations were variable, during 1999 the average
   concentrations were as much as 15.5 times the goal concentration. For
   year 2000, TPHs concentrations were only 7.4-fold the proposed value.
   For the 1999-2000 period, PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons)
   concentrations decreased by 82\%. Some PAHs with 2, 3, 4, and 5 aromatic
   rings were removed up to 100\% values.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive irrigated rice system is the most important food production
   system in the world. Continued population growth necessitates increased
   rice production to meet the increased need of food production through
   increased rice productivity to ensure food security. In contrast, the
   recent slowdown in yield growth in intensive irrigated rice-based
   cropping systems as a result of deterioration of soil health and decline
   in productivity level is a serious cause for concern. The objective of
   this research was to investigate the soil organic carbon (SOC) build-up
   and its dynamics in rice-rice cropping system by including a green
   manure (GM) crop Sesbania rostrata Berm. either during fallow and/or
   intercrop at 4 : 1 ratio as additive series without changing rice
   geometry. The results revealed that there is a gradual build-up of SOC
   when S. rostrata included and in situ incorporated at flowering stage as
   a basic means of improving soil quality in rice-rice cropping system.
   Further, the soil organic matter fractions viz. humic acid and fulvic
   acid were also improved in all GM-incorporated systems. In general, the
   proportion of fulvic acid was higher than humic acid. Cropping system
   involving three GMs viz. S. rostrata-rice/S. rostrata-rice/S. rostrata
   registered significantly higher SOC and was 10.63 percent higher than
   traditional rice-rice cropping system (A(1)). This was followed by S.
   rostrata-rice/S. rostrata-rice system. Although the traditional
   rice-rice cropping system (A(1)) also conserved SOC (0.29 and 1.69 \%
   higher than initial during first and second annual cropping cycle,
   respectively), the magnitude was very low. Repeated application of S.
   rostrata as GM improved SOC, which formed the basis for sustainable
   management of soil resources. It can be concluded that S. rostrata would
   affect the rate of loss of SOC in cropping systems and its ultimate
   level in soils.}},

Abstract = {{The value of ammonium sulphate (+ SO4) fertilizer as a method of
   controlling potato common scab varies from field to field and from year
   to year. We examined the influence of two fertilizer regimes on the
   biodiversity and antibiosis activity (in vitro) of culturable
   rhizobacterial populations recovered from fields with a similar history
   of potato common scab. Root zone soils treated with + SO4 fertilizers
   were colonized by significantly (P = 0.05) more species-diverse
   communities of bacteria than those managed with ammonium nitrate
   fertilizers (+NO3) In bioassays conducted on artificial media adjusted
   to pH 4.9 (acid) or pH 6.8 (base), in vitro antibiosis in bacterial
   strains against Streptomyces scabies was found to be dependent on
   fertilizer regime (P = 0.023), with more isolates with antibiosis
   ability being recovered from + SO4 compared to +NO3 treated soils.
   Overall, bacterial species from the genera Bacillus (18-35\%) and
   Pseudomonas (15-18\%) were major components of those rhizoflora
   communities antagonistic to S. scabies. Under our field conditions, soil
   acidification with + SO4 treatments stimulated the development of
   rhizobacterial communities that generated secondary metabolites with (in
   vitro) antibiosis ability, against S. scabies. This occurred both in the
   liquid and vapour phase (volatile gases); the latter most notably by
   Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus and Pseudomonas chlororaphis. We
   postulate that in hot, dry seasons, antibiosis against S. scabies
   mediated by +SO4 treatments, and the competitive bacterial communities
   they engender, would be less effective in controlling potato common
   scab, as the active moieties would be rapidly volatilized into the
   atmosphere. In contrast, biocontrol would be more effective in wetter
   seasons, the active moieties being retained, in and around the potato
   root zone for greater biologically significant periods of time. (C) 2003

   inoculants, especially the biological control agents, it is necessary to
   assess their negative influence on such beneficial forms as AM fungi
   since they help the plant withstand various stresses. Among other
   molecules, pseudomonads present in the rhizosphere secrete the
   antifungal, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) and are currently in great
   demand as bioinoculants. Based on the cultural, biochemical, and
   molecular tools we show that DAPG producing pseudomonads recovered from

   such effects on non-target organisms will help early acceptance of

   control plant diseases. During the last decades, research and
   application of biological control agents (BCAs) as a pest control
   strategy have gained increasing attention. This review focuses
   specifically on non-target effects of bacterial BCAs that are used to
   suppress root pathogenic fungi. It attempts to critically evaluate the
   strengths and weaknesses of non-target effect studies published to date
   and relate them to the success of the BCA in fungal pathogen control.
   Significant non-target effects of BCAs have indeed been observed, but
   these are generally small in scale and limited to a growth season, and
   have not been proven to affect soil health. We discuss these studies and
   point out what we believe are notable deficiencies. Among the modes of
   disease suppression by BCAs, antibiotic production is believed to be of
   major importance. But assurances that in situ antibiotic production
   actually occurs in environmental samples are lacking in the non-target
   effect studies. Also the effectiveness of the BCA on the target
   pathogen, the absence of appropriate controls for inoculation effects,
   and the presence of pathogenic fungi are missing in most studies. In
   future non-target effect studies we recommend focusing on proven
   effective BCAs and clearly distinguishing effects of antimicrobial
   compounds from effects of general microbial activity. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{A field investigation was carried out during 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 on
   a sandy-loam soil at Modipuram, Uttar Pradesh, to evolve efficient
   management practices for rice (Oryza sativa L.) residue recycling in the
   succeeding wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori \& Paol.) crop. Five
   rice residue-management practices comprising residue incorporated (T-1),
   residue burnt in-situ (T-2), residue incorporated + mixed culture of
   Trichoderma reesei Simmons, T. viridi Pers. and Aspergillus awamori
   Nakaz. (T-3), residue incorporated + N-enriched phosphocompost (T-4) and
   residue burnt + N-enriched phosphocompost (T-5) were allocated in
   randomized block design with 4 replications. In-situ burning of rice
   residue + N-enriched phosphocompost though found on a par with residue
   incorporation + N-enriched phosphocompost, resulted in a maximum grain
   yield; being 48.8 and 44.6\% higher than mere incorporation of rice
   residue during the both years. The treatment effects on soil fertility
   in succeeding wheat behaved alike the grain yield. The total soil
   microbial count (Azotobacter, fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes) 30 and
   60 days after sowing revealed that microfloral population was higher
   under all the residue management practice compared to in-situ burning.
   Addition of phosphocompost harboured more Azotobacter population,
   whereas bacterial population was higher under rice residue incorporation
   and inoculated with cellulolytic fungi.}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity of a dominant
   crop field earthworm (Drawida willsi, Michaelsen) was investigated under
   laboratory conditions following the application of two recommended
   agricultural (single and double) doses of butachlor (1.1 and 2.2 mg a.i.
   kg(-1) dry soil), malathion (2.2 and 4.4 mg a.i. kg(-1) dry soil) and
   carbofuran (1.1 and 2.2 mg a.i. kg(-1) dry soil) to the soil. A sharp
   decline in the AChE activity of D. willsi was observed up to 9 and 12
   days following treatment of carbofuran and malathion in both single and
   double doses, respectively, whereas very little inhibition was noticed
   in case of butachlor. D. willsi worms took 45 and 75 days to resume
   normal AChE activity after exposure to both single and double doses of
   malathion and carbofuran, respectively. Earlier {[}Soil Biol. Biochem.
   31 (1999) 363-366], {[}Ph.D. thesis, Sambalpur University, Orissa,
   India, 2003] and {[}Pedobiologia (spl. issue), in press] reported that
   D. willsi takes 75-90 days and 90-105 days to resume normal growth and
   reproduction following application of both single and double
   agricultural doses of malathion and carbofuran, respectively. On the
   basis of the present and previous studies, we strongly suggest that the
   time gap between the first and second application of malathion,
   irrespective of single and double dosage, should be at least 90 days,
   whereas it should be at least 105 days for carbofuran. Butachlor was
   found to be very toxic, suppressing growth, sexual maturation and cocoon
   production of D. willsi at both single and double doses {[}Ph.D. thesis,
   Sambalpur University, Orissa, India,. 2003]. We therefore suggest that
   application of organochlorine pesticides like butachlor should be
   avoided as far as possible to ensure maintenance of good soil health.

Abstract = {{Agroforestry practices in northern latitudes, although less diverse than
   those in warmer regions, have unique advantages over conventional
   land-use systems in the region in terms of water-quality enhancement,
   carbon sequestration, and biodiversity conservation. Tree intercropping,
   especially, is a potentially promising agroforestry option in the
   region. Understanding the ecological interactions between trees and
   crops in such intercropped systems provides the basis for designing
   efficient systems with potential for wider applicability. With this
   objective, the experience from several years of research on this aspect
   at the University of Guelph, in southern Ontario, Canada are presented.
   Yields of C3 crops intercropped with trees, as well as growth of trees,
   did not differ from those in corresponding sole-stand ( conventional)
   systems of crops and trees. But, soil organic carbon content and bird
   and insect diversity increased in the intercropped area. The abundance
   and distribution of earthworms were higher closer to the tree rows
   indicating improved soil health. The C sequestration potential in
   fast-growing tree ( hybridpoplar)based intercropping systems was four
   times more than that reported for conventional agricultural fields in
   the region. Because of reduced fertilizer use and more efficient
   N-cycling, the tree-intercropping systems could also lead to the
   reduction of nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural fields by about
   0.7 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Marginal or degraded land that is suitable for
   agroforestry is estimated to be 57 million ha in Canada. Tree/crop
   intercropping is one agroforestry system that shows great potential for
   this region. We suggest that this land-management option can be placed
   above conventional agriculture in terms of long term-productivity and
   sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Transgenic or genetically modified plants possess novel genes that
   impart beneficial characteristics such as herbicide resistance. One of
   the least understood areas in the environmental risk assessment of
   genetically modified crops is their impact on soil- and plant-associated
   microbial communities. The potential for interaction between transgenic
   plants and plant residues and the soil microbial community is not well
   understood. The recognition that these interactions could change
   microbial biodiversity and affect ecosystem functioning has initiated a
   limited number of studies in the area. At this time, studies have shown
   the possibility that transgenes can be transferred to native soil
   microorganisms through horizontal gene transfer, although there is not
   evidence of this occurring in the soil. Furthermore, novel proteins have
   been shown to be released from transgenic plants into the soil
   ecosystem, and their presence can influence the biodiversity of the
   microbial community by selectively stimulating the growth of organisms
   that can use them. Microbial diversity can be altered when associated
   with transgenic plants; however, these effects are both variable and
   transient. Soil- and plant-associated microbial communities are
   influenced not only by plant species and transgene insertion but also by
   environmental factors such as field site and sampling date. Minor
   alterations in the diversity of the microbial community could affect
   soil health and ecosystem functioning, and therefore, the impact that
   plant variety may have on the dynamics of the rhizosphere microbial
   populations and in turn plant growth and health and ecosystem
   sustainability, requires further study.}},

Abstract = {{In order to assess the potential impact of long-term sewage sludge
   application on soil health, the equivalent of about 25 years of
   agronomic applications of low-metal ('EQ') sewage sludge products were
   made to greenhouse soil columns. After a 6-year period of
   `equilibration', during which time successive crops were grown with
   irrigation by simulated acid rain, the plant-available quantities of
   trace elements were estimated in the soils by extraction with 0.01 M
   CaCl2 at 90 degreesC, and measured directly by uptake into a crop of red
   clover (Trifolium pratense L.). Soil pH had a strong influence on the
   level of extractable and plant-available metals, and because the tested
   sludge products affected soil pH differently, pH was directly factored
   into the comparison of different sludge treatments with controls.
   CaCl2-extractable levels of several metals (Cu, Zn, Mo), sulfur and
   phosphorus were found to be higher in the soils amended with
   organic-rich sludge products than in the control soils. However,
   extractable Cd and Ni were not significantly elevated by the sludge
   amendments, presumably because of the low total loading of these metals.
   Copper, Zn and Mo applied in the form of sludge ash had low soil
   extractability, suggesting that these trace metals were trapped in
   high-temperature mineral phases formed during sludge incineration, and
   resisted subsequent weathering in the soil environment. Extractable soil
   metals in the alkaline-stabilized sludge treatment were also generally
   low. Phytotoxicity from the sludge metal loadings (Zn less than or equal
   to 125, Cu less than or equal to 135 kg/ha), was not clearly indicated
   as long as soil pH was maintained in the 6-7 range by lime amendment.
   Nevertheless, unexplained depressions in yield were noted with some of
   the sludge products applied, particularly the dewatered and composted
   materials. On limed soil columns, the most consistent effect of sludge
   product amendment on red clover composition was a marked increase in
   plant Mo.}},

Abstract = {{Much attention is paid to soil health and environmental safety.
   Earthworms are an important indicator of soil ecosystem health and
   safety. Ecological toxicity of acetochlor and excessive urea, in both
   their single and joint effects, on earthworm Esisenia foelide was thus
   studied using the soil-culture method. Acetochlor had an enhanced
   toxicity from low concentration to high concentration. The mortality of
   earthworms after a 6-day exposure was changed from 0 to 86.7\%, and the
   weight change rate ranged from 7.86 to - 30.43\%, when the concentration
   of acetochlor was increased from 164 to 730 mg kg(-1). Urea expressed
   its positive and beneficial effects on earthworms when its concentration
   was lower than 500 mg kg(-1). Strongly toxic effects took place when the
   concentration of urea was higher than 1000 mg kg(-1). The mortality of
   earthworms exposed to urea reached 100\% when its concentration was more
   than 1500 mg kg(-1). When the concentration of urea was lower than 500
   mg kg(-1), there were antagonistic effects between the two agrochemicals
   on earthworms; when the concentration of urea was higher than 500 mg
   kg(-1), joint toxic effects of acetochlor and excessive urea on
   earthworms were synergic. In any case, excessive urea application is
   very harmful to the health of soil ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) and its different pools have key importance in
   nutrient availability, soil structure, in the flux of trace gases
   between land surface and the atmosphere, and thus improving soil health.
   This is particularly critical for tropical soils. The rates of
   accumulation and decomposition of carbon in SOM are influenced by
   several factors that are best embodied by simulation models. However,
   little is known about the performance of SOM simulation model in an acid
   tropical soil under different tillage systems including no-tillage (NT).
   Our objective was to simulate soil organic matter dynamics on an Acrisol
   under no-tillage and different plowed systems using Century model.
   Tillage systems consisted of no-tillage, disc plow, heavy disc harrow
   followed by disc plow, and heavy disc harrow. Soil C stocks simulated by
   Century model showed tendency to recovery only under no-tillage. Also,
   simulated amounts of C stocks of slow and active pools were more
   sensitive to management impacts than total organic C. The values
   estimated by Century of soil C stocks and organic carbon in the slow and
   passive pools fitted satisfactorily with the measured data. Thus fitted,
   except for the active pool, Century showed acceptable performance in the
   prediction of SOM dynamics in an acid tropical soil. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Saprophytic soil-borne pathogens can be either actively suppressed by
   organic amendments or enhanced, depending on soil health conditions.
   This can be deleterious in the event of selection of a soil-borne
   population by previous soil management and short crop rotation. Trials
   were performed in the open field and in pots, using naturally infected
   soil from intensive crop systems, i.e., soil from fields with 8 years of
   strawberry cultivation. The aim was to study short-term response of
   Pythium and soil microbial populations to green manure. The use of green
   manure in these naturally infested soils, 3-10 weeks after fresh tissue
   incorporation, caused Pythium populations to increase concurrent with an
   increase in soil microbial populations, and did not result in the
   suppression of the pathogen. A more elaborate trial was performed under
   controlled conditions, amending soil with fresh wheat plant material,
   air-dried wheat plant material and an organic fertilizer with a high
   level of humic substances. Although compared to the original soil, all
   amendments caused a similar increase in organic matter content and small
   differences in soil respiration, incorporation of fresh, not decomposed,
   plant material strongly increased Pythium, while the organic fertilizer
   did not affect the original level of the pathogen population. The
   increase in total number of fungi and bacteria did not have any
   suppressive effect on the Pythium population in naturally infested soil
   used for this study.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for rapid decomposition of rice (Oryza saliva L.) straw
   employing pre-treatment with aqueous solution containing 1.25\% urea,
   1.25\% ZnSO4, 0.625\% FeSO4 and 0.0625\% CuSO4 in the first step for 48
   hr followed by composting was developed during 1998 to prepare quality
   manure. Rice straw alone or in combination with pigeonpea {[}Cajanas
   cajan (L.) Millsp.] (4:1) was treated for altering the lignocellulosic
   complex of the rice residues to be decomposed. In (he second stage, the
   treated materials were composted for 21 days. Pre-treatment followed by
   composting helped in lowering the C:N ratio of the substrate and
   improved the quality of compost in terms of N, P and K. The highest
   re-sponse of pretreatment and composting was obtained in the mixture of
   treated rice straw + pigeonpea hull (4:1). In field investigation. rice
   straw compost was applied @ 2.5 to 7.5 tonnes/ha in an Ustochrept of
   Indo-Gangetic Plain as per treatments during initiation of each crop
   cycle of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori \& Paol.)-rice system
   during 1998-99 and 1999-2000. The performance of various compost
   materials in conjunction with NPK were compared to that of water-soaked
   rice straw as well as mere NPK fertilizers. Highest improvement in
   organic carbon (0-92\%). microbial biomass carbon (190 mu.g/g soil),
   micro-floral population and total N (721 kg/ha), available P (39.6
   kg/ha) and K (175 kg/ha) in soil after 2 crop cycles was recorded with
   compost made up of treated rice straw+pigeonpea hull (4:1) wherein yield
   of rice and wheat was increased to the extent of 19.9 and 23.7,
   respectively, compared to water-soaked rice straw.}},

Abstract = {{Ethiopia is a land of soil museum where different soil orders except
   Gelisol of USDA Soil Taxonomy occur in varying frequencies depending
   upon existing physiographic and agroecologic positions. These orders
   correspond to different soil groups of the FAO/UNESCO system. The soils
   are potentially fertile, but indicate a number of physical, chemical and
   biological constraints and thus their sustainability is only at risk.
   Many developmental aspects are still either unattended or only at the
   initial stage of their adoption. Systematic research and developmental
   activities on soil survey, soil classification, land evaluation and land
   use planning for specific uses, watershed development and water
   harvesting, zero tillage adoption, afforestation, utilization of
   available resources, restoration of degraded land and maintenance and
   enrichment of soil fertility followed by conservation and management
   packages on sustainable basis need to be addressed. A healthy soil can
   only yield healthy crops for healthy population in order to build up an
   economically prosperous healthy nation of Ethiopia. In terms of genesis,
   taxonomy and potential fertility, the Ethiopian soils contain scientific
   merits to be discovered and recognized selectively as reference for
   strategic planning of development to attain food self-sufficiency
   followed by food surplus in days to come. There is ample scope for
   horizontal as well as vertical expansions of the land, if strategic
   management policies are executed at the grass root level.}},

Abstract = {{The compost worm Eisenia fetida was used to demonstrate the avoidance by
   worms of Cu contaminated soil. Soils were collected from two avocado
   orchards in north eastern New South Wales, Australia. In avoidance
   trials, worms preferred non-contaminated control soils, sourced from
   adjacent to the orchard or an OECD control soil, when Cu residues in the
   orchard soils reached 4-34 mg Cu kg(-1). At levels of 553 mg Cu kg(-1),
   90\% avoidance of orchard soil was observed. The worms showed preference
   for the soils in the order; uncontaminated field derived soil > OECD
   standard soil > Cu contaminated orchard soil. It was demonstrated that
   OECD standard soil was less favoured by worms than control soil derived
   from the test sites. While Cu was found to be the primary influence on
   worm avoidance in orchard soil, other factors, such as elevated soil Zn
   concentrations, could not be discounted. In a corresponding field study,
   it was shown that earthworms occurred at lower density in orchard soils
   with a history of Cu fungicide use. In one such orchard, soil Cu
   concentrations of up to 270 mg kg(-1) were determined and no earthworms
   were found, while nearby control sites and less contaminated sites
   within the orchard had up to 40.7 g m(-2) earthworm biomass. Considering
   the potential for Cu to accumulate in these soils and the subsequent
   impacts on soil biota, our results highlight the importance of limiting
   future application of Cu based fungicides. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

   rotation with no-till corn, conventionally tilled wheat, and no-till
   double-cropped soybean, using postemergence (POST) herbicides on the
   basis of field scouting; and System D was a 3-yr rotation of
   corn-soybean-winter wheat with rye and hairy vetch cover crops, using
   cultivation and reduced rates of POST herbicides based on field
   scouting. Spring weed assessment in 1999 was similar for species
   evenness (Shannon's E) and diversity (Shannon's H') indices. Weed
   density was lowest in System C because wheat in this system received a
   spring herbicide application. In the final fall assessment, Shannon's H'
   was greater in System D than System C. Common lambsquarters, eastern
   black nightshade, and jimsonweed were more abundant in System D than
   Systems A1, A2, and C. Fall 1999 assessment also indicated Canada
   thistle was more prevalent in Systems A1 and A2 than the other three
   systems. During the 6-yr period, densities of jimsonweed, eastern black
   nightshade, morningglory species, crabgrass, and fall panicum
   dramatically increased in a particular system for 1 to 2 yr, then
   declined to levels similar to other systems. Overall, weed communities
   were quite stable and effective weed management did not result in
   dramatic changes in the weed community, regardless of the approach to
   cropping systems or weed management.}},

Abstract = {{This study was carried out to determine the possible effects of the
   Afsin-Elbistan Coal Power Plant (AECPP) on the environment.. The soil
   and plant samples were collected, based on the dominant wind direction,
   which is from northeast to southwest and we defined the northeast part
   of the plant as the less contaminated direction (LCD) and the southwest
   part as the more contaminated direction (MCD). The results indicated
   that the AECPP created environmental problems and caused contaminations
   especially in the MCD. The results of the statistical analysis for the
   measured attributes between the LCD and the MCD showed that there were
   significant differences for pH, SO4-2-S, Ni and Pb. Significant
   correlations were found between the distance from the AECPP and some of
   the measured soil and plant parameters in the MCD. The concentrations of
   SO4-2-S, Ni and Pb decreased as the distance increased. The discharge
   water carries a potential risk for the aquatic life and soil health in
   the area. The honey quality was also affected negatively by fly ash and

Abstract = {{This experiment was conducted for two consecutive years 2000 and 2001 to
   study the effect of different levels of tillage and various combinations
   of cereal and legume residues on sorghum {[}Sorghum bicolor (L.)
   Moench]. The experiment was laid out in a split-plot design with three
   replications. In both years of experimentation, surface mulching
   increased green as well as dry biomass production of sorghum in
   comparison to other mechanical treatments. Surface mulching and
   incorporation with tractor-drawn cultivator produced (significantly)
   maximum green fodder 22.7 t ha(-1) (8.3 t ha(-1) dry fodder) in 2000 and
   23.7 t ha(-1) green fodder (8.7 t ha(-1) dry fodder) in 2001. A
   combination of 2 t ha(-1) legume (Leucaena) dry litter + 40 kg N ha(-1)
   through urea fertilizer produced significantly more green as well as dry
   fodder of sorghum. The organic C and total N per cent were increased in
   surface mulching, but the results were non-significant. However,
   application of cereal as well as legume residues significantly increased
   the organic C by 0.03\% due to sole legume, 0.04\% combined application,
   and 0.05\% sole cereal application over the control. A similar trend in
   available N was observed. The microbial population, viz., bacteria,
   fungi, and actinomycetes were not influenced by any of the mechanical
   treatments. However, application of wheat as well as Leucaena litter
   residues significantly increased the microbial populations, i.e.,
   68-80\% bacteria, 120-140\% fungi, and 39-50\% actinomycetes in two
   years of continued sorghum cultivation over the initial population.
   Maximum input energy was used in fertilizer and bio-residues and maximum
   output (151200 MJ ha(-1) in 2000 and 156 600 MJ ha(-1) in 2001) as well
   as gross income (\$5040 in 2000 and \$5220 in 2001) in surface mulching
   incorporated by a tractor-drawn cultivator. Further, the application of
   2 t ha(-1) litter biomass of Leucaena + 40 kg ha(-1) urea top-dressed in
   standing sorghum produced maximum output energy (163 800 MJ ha-1 in 2000
   and 167 400 MJ ha(-1) in 2001). This treatment also gave maximum income
   of \$5460 ha(-1) in 2000 and \$5580 ha(-1) in 2001.}},

Abstract = {{Adoption of conservation tillage for corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean
   (Glycine max L.) rotations, has stagnated over the past several years
   despite the evidence of the benefits to erosion control, soil health,
   and associated natural resources derived from conservation tillage. The
   Monsanto Centers of Excellence were established to evaluate the
   potential benefits of conservation tillage across a range of soils and
   climates. Our objective is to summarize the results from field-scate
   studies conducted at 13 Monsanto Centers of Excellence sites in nine
   states from 1998 through 2002. Strip-tillage, no-tillage, and
   conventional corn production, and narrow- and wide-row, no-tillage and
   conventional tillage soybean production were evaluated in this study.
   Nine of the 13 sites included a stale seedbed ``fast start{''} corn
   treatment by which the seedbed is prepared in the fall by conventional
   tillage and a spring herbicide burndown if needed. Neither soil bulk
   density nor crop emergence showed any significant differences among
   tillage systems for either crop throughout the five-year study.
   Earthworm populations were higher with no-tillage than conventional
   tillage. Soil quality indicators were not significantly different among
   the tillage systems. Soil temperature at the 5 cm depth was similar for
   strip-and conventional-tillage, with both being higher than no-tillage
   Yield differences among tillage systems within years were not
   significant for either crop, but profit for no-tillage and strip-tillage
   corn was the highest in four of five years. The five-year average profit
   for soybean was a so highest for the no-tillage, narrow-row system.
   Rotating corn and soybean using no-tillage systems resulted in \$130 to
   \$145 ha(-1) (\$53 to \$59 ac(-1)) more profit than the other practices.
   Farmers, crop consultants, and others should carefully consider overall
   profit rather than just crop yield when evaluating alternative tillage
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in the potential of applying an electric field
   to soil to move and stimulate the degradation of contaminants, but we
   know little of the impact of this approach on exposed microbial
   communities. The effect of electrokinetics (3.14 A m(-2)) on soil
   bacterial and fungal communities was studied using soil cartridge
   microcosms (13 cm x 5.4 cm x 5.9 cm). After 27 days of electrokinetics,
   a zone of low pH (<4) was detected close to the anode. Soil exposed to
   electrokinetics and immediately adjacent to the anode demonstrated an
   increase in carbon substrate utilisation potential (less than or equal
   to 290\%) and microbial respiration rates. The diversity and structure
   of the bacterial community showed little response to electrokinetics,
   with the exception of soil close to the anode. Here, an increase in the
   percentage of Gram-positive species isolated was identified, most
   notably of Bacillus megaterium. Overall, the only detectable response of
   the microbial community was observed in soil immediately adjacent to the
   anode. The results of this study provide evidence that the application
   of electrokinetics has no serious negative effect on `soil microbial
   health', thus endorsing its validity as a viable soil remediation
   technology. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the application of poultry litter at 0.0, 6.7, 13.4, and
   20.1 tons/ha on population changes during the growing season on nematode
   communities were evaluated in two cotton production fields in North
   Carolina. Numbers of bactivorous nematodes increased at midseason in
   response to the rate at which litter was applied but decreased with
   increasing litter application rates at cotton harvest. Numbers of
   fungivores at cotton harvest were related positively to the rate of
   litter applied, and this affected a positive increase in the
   fungivore-to-bacterivore ratio at this sampling date. The rate at which
   poultry litter was applied resulted in an increase in the bacterivore to
   plant-parasite ratio, and this corresponded with increased cotton lint
   yield. Trophic diversity was increased by litter application rate at
   cotton harvest at one location but not at another. The plant-parasite
   maturity index was greater consistently at one site than at a second
   site where the Hoplolaimus columbus population density was above the
   damage threshold for cotton. The population density of H. columbus was
   suppressed with increasing rates of poultry litter application, but
   other plant-parasitic nematodes were affected marginally.}},

Abstract = {{Soil nematodes are both taxonomically and functionally diverse, respond
   quickly to soil perturbation and have much potential as indicators of
   soil health. However, because of the perceived difficulty of identifying
   nematodes to species level morphologically, they are frequently
   neglected in soil ecological studies. Recently, extraction of soil DNA,
   amplification of 18S rDNA genes using nematode consensus primers and
   subsequent separation by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
   has been used to estimate nematode diversity in soil. Here, we
   investigate an alternative approach whereby nematodes are first
   extracted from the soil prior the 18S rDNA gene amplification using
   universal primers. We used this system to estimate nematode species
   richness in 10 soil samples-five from Scotland and five from the
   Netherlands. There was no direct correlation between species richness as
   estimated morphologically and by the PCR-DGGE method. However,
   inspection of the data suggested that the samples fell into two discrete
   groups, which was confirmed by canonical and stepwise discriminant
   function analysis; the values for the Shannon and equitability indices
   being important discriminators. Further analysis revealed a significant
   relationship between morphological species richness and DGGE estimates
   for species that represented greater than 1\% of the sample biomass. (C)

Pages = {{421-431}},
Abstract = {{Several studies were carried out to investigate the soil microbial
   components involved in suppressing strawberry black rot root which
   occurs throughout the Italian strawberry growing region. Quantitative
   and qualitative evaluation of fungi involved in black root rot were
   combined with several soil microbial parameters involved in soil
   suppressiveness towards black root rot agents. The first survey, carried
   out in an intensively cultivated area of northern Italy, identified
   Rhizoctonia spp. as the main root pathogen together with several typical
   weak pathogens belonging to the well-known black rot root complex of
   strawberry crop: Cylindrocarpon destructans, Fusarium oxysporum, F
   solani, Pestalotia longiseta and others. The root colonisation frequency
   of strawberry plants increased strongly from autumn to spring at
   harvesting stage. Rhizoctonia spp. were the only pathogens which
   followed the rising trend of root colonisation with relative frequency;
   all the weak pathogens of strawberry black root rot complex did not vary
   their frequency. Only non-pathogenic fungi decreased from autumn to
   spring when at least 60\% of colonising fungi were represented by
   Rhizoctonia. These data suggested that the late vegetative stage was the
   best time to record the soil inoculum of root rot agents in strawberry
   using root infection frequency as a parameter of soil health. A further
   study was performed in two fields, chosen for their common soil texture
   and pH, but with significant differences in previous soil management:
   one (ALSIA) had been subjected to strawberry monoculture without organic
   input for several years; the other (CIF) has been managed according to a
   4-year crop rotation and high organic input. In this study Pythium
   artificially inoculated was adopted as an indicator for the behaviour of
   saprophytically living pathogens in bulk soil. Pythium showed a sharp,
   different response after inoculation in bulk soil from the two soil
   systems evaluated. Pythium was suppressed only in the CIF field where
   the highest levels of total fungi and fluorescent bacteria and highest
   variability were observed. The suppressiveness conditions towards
   Pythium, observed in the CIF and absent in the ALSIA field, corresponded
   with the root infection frequency recorded at the late vegetative stage
   on strawberry plants grown in the two fields: strawberry plants from the
   CIF field showed lower root colonisation frequency and higher
   variability than that recorded on those coming from the ALSIA field.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive cropping systems with fertilizer responsive crops that rely on
   high input of inorganic fertilizers often lead to nonsustainabihty in
   production and also pose a serious threat to soil health. Application of
   organic sources of nutrients with no or very little use of fossil
   fuel-based inorganic fertilizers is rapidly gaining favor. However,
   considering economics and also physiological potential of varieties,
   entire dependence on organic sources of nutrients may not be adequate to
   attain the most productivity. Integrated nutrient management with both
   organic and inorganic fertilizers was investigated. A field trial was
   conducted with six different combinations of organic manure (FYM and
   Vermicompost) and inorganic fertilizers {[}nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium
   (NPK)] to study their effect on yield and oil quality in basil (Ocimum
   basilicum L. cv. Vikas Sudha). Results from the experiment revealed that
   among the six treatments compared, the combination of Vermicompost at 5
   t ha(-1) + fertilizer NPK 50:25:25 kg ha(-1) performed the best with
   respect to growth, herb, dry matter, oil content, and oil yield. Content
   of principal constituents of basil oil (Methyl chavicol and Linalool)
   were also higher under integrated nutrient management especially when
   Vermicompost was applied in combination with NPK. Furthermore, it was
   noticed that organic carbon (C), available N, and P were higher in
   postharvest soils that received organic manure alone or in combination
   with inorganic fertilizers than control (no fertilizer or manure) and
   inorganic fertilizer treated soil. This study indicates that combined
   application of manure and fertilizer helps to increase crop productivity
   and quality and maintaining soil fertility.}},

Abstract = {{Soil electrical conductivity (EC) is a useful indicator in managing
   agricultural systems, but tools for convenient and inexpensive
   measurements in the field are generally lacking. Handheld conductivity
   probes were designed to evaluate in-field naturally occurring and
   human-induced total soluble electrolyte levels in soil and water. The
   probes were used to survey and monitor EC in the field and to assess
   soil and water quality as related to environmental stability and
   sustainable food production. A pencil-sized 16-cm probe (PP) was
   connected to a handheld Hanna (DiST WP 4) conductivity meter, resulting
   in an economical, compact, and easy to use device. The tool provided
   accurate and precise results compared with laboratory instrumentation
   under standardized conditions of soil water content and temperature.
   Soil samples, varying widely in texture and organic matter content, and
   having ECs ranging from 0.13 to 2.32dSm(-1) were used for comparison.
   Mean values and coefficients of variation were similar for the PP and
   the commercial laboratory EC meter with 2 values determined with the two
   instruments being strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.96-0.99). The handheld
   and PP probes effectively replaced expensive and cumbersome laboratory
   and field instruments used to measure EC in water and soil samples. The
   probe measurements were useful alternatives to conventional methods as
   they enabled accurate and precise measurement of EC, were a manageable
   size for field use, and were reliable and economic. The utility of EC as
   an indicator of soil health, plantavailable N, and environmental quality
   is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{The prairie ecosystem of the northern Great Plains is a major
   contributor to world food production. This has not come without
   ecological costs. Arable land of the prairie ecosystem is one of the
   most altered landscapes on this continent. Only small remnants of native
   short-grass prairie remain and field boundary habitats at best provide
   only narrow corridors between these remnant natural areas. The
   ecological role of field boundary habitats within the scope of extensive
   prairie agriculture has not been fully quantified. Sustainable
   management strategies, crop loss prevention and maintenance of soil
   health are central to our capacity to maintain the biological
   productivity of agricultural systems. Field boundary areas harbour many
   arthropods, including insects, spiders, mites, and other invertebrates,
   which are integral to crop loss and to soil health because they include
   both beneficial and pest species. These habitats represent an interface
   between farm practices and the ecosystem and contribute to an
   environment where farm inputs are able to enhance rather than replace
   natural processes. The implementation of buffer zones where pesticides
   are not permitted within cultivated habitats bordering potential
   wildlife refuges such as field margins, water bodies and shelterbelts
   will challenge IPM practitioners and researchers to search for more
   ecological and environmentally friendly strategies to manage potential
   pest insects. Several pest insects have aggregated spatial distribution
   patterns along field edges and chemical sprays are concentrated along
   such areas. Currently, the only control strategy available to growers to
   reduce insect pest populations along field perimeters is chemical
   control. However, some research progress has been made with the
   incorporation of trap crops for pest species such as grasshoppers
   (Orthoptera: Acrididae) and cabbage seedpod weevil (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae). The advent of federal legislation in Canada to require
   buffer zones when pest control actions are employed will require the
   development of alternative non-chemical management strategies to manage
   the pest species within these areas.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the influence of forest
   wildfires that occurred 1994 in Gelibolu (Gallipoli) National Park,
   Turkey, on some physical, chemical and biological properties of soils.
   Soil samples were collected from five different locations as replicates
   from both burned and nearby unburned sites. Results showed that
   available phosphorus and potassium content, pH, and electrical
   conductivity of burned soils were higher than those of unburned
   counterparts. On the other hand, aggregate stability, hydraulic
   conductivity, total porosity, soil water content, cation exchange
   capacity, total nitrogen, urease activity, and microbial biomass carbon
   values of burned soils were lower than those of unburned ones. The mean
   soil organic carbon values were 2.94\% for burned and 5.01\% for
   unburned soils, whereas those of microbial biomass were 1.2 mg C g
   soil(-1) and 1.69 mg C g soil(-1). Aggregate stability values were found
   to be 88.32\% and 94.44\% (P < 0.05), and urease activities were 185 mg
   kg(-1) 2-h(-1) and 366 mg kg(-1) 2-h(-1) (P < 0.01) for burned and
   unburned soils samples, respectively. This research showed that negative
   effects of fire still remain in the soil even after 8 years and recovery
   of soil health was very low.}},

Abstract = {{Soil productivity and health were analyzed using an experimental
   procedure designed for this kind of studies. The continuous loss of
   fertile soil obliged the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to
   declare soil as an item to be protected as a support of the world
   society welfare. The procedure here described is in accordance with the
   premises necessary for a rational and sustainable development of soil
   and the resources it contains and can be used to study any soil all over
   the world.
   The study was carried out using soil microbial population as a
   bioindicator of soil health. Microbial activity was followed using the
   microcalorimetric technique. The microcalorimetric study can be
   complemented through a deep analysis of soil physical, chemical and
   biological properties together with a study of the environmental
   properties that have a strong influence on the afore mentioned
   properties and, thus on the microbial activity in soil. The different
   properties follow different ASTM, ISS/FAO, USDA, etc. well defined
   standards.
   The experimental procedure reported in this work could be very helpful
   to create a data basis that could be useful to quantify and control soil
   potentiality or design soil decontamination and recovery systems.}},

Abstract = {{Since the introduction of pesticides and artificial fertilisers, the
   appreciation for the soil as the foundation for agricultural production
   diminished. Recently, attention is paid to the possible negative
   influences of these aspects on the microbial population in the soil. The
   withdrawal of most soil fumigants enhances the focus on soil aspects
   like root disease incidence, soil resistance, and soil and plant health.
   Scientific research has started to develop strategies to increase soil
   health. Methods applied are crop frequency, crop rotation, use of
   resistant varieties of economic and green manure crops, biological soil
   disinfestation, the application of compost or chitin. Additionally
   chemical pesticides may be applied. The effect of these measurements
   will be established in monitoring the development of crops for yield and
   disease incidence and assessment of the microbial population in the
   soil. Preliminary results from the first year indicate that biological
   soil disinfestation is effective in decreasing the nematode populations
   of free-living Trichodorid nematodes and root lesion nematodes
   (Pratylenchus penetrans). The green manure crop Tagetes patula decreased
   the Pratylenchus penetrans, but increased the Trichodorid population.
   Chitin application diminished the Trichodorids. The development of the
   sugar beet crop after the different treatments was inversely related to
   the nematode counts. This project delivers new techniques to improve
   soil health, and insight in the specific changes within the soil.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to increase pools of soil organic C (SOC) in agricultural
   ecosystems is of interest both for sequestering atmospheric CO,, and for
   restoring organic matter pools important to soil health. It has been
   well established that tillage and harvest management regimes can
   influence SOC in cropland, but long-term, continuous experiments are
   rare. We investigated the dynamics of relic and new SOC pools using
   delta(13)C analysis in cornfields (Zea mays L.) established in 1972 at
   the University of Connecticut Research Farm. The plots have been tinder
   no-till (NT) or conventional till (CT) management, with residues
   returned (+) or residues removed (-) within each tillage treatment.
   After 28 yr of continuous management, NT increased SOC significantly by
   48.3 +/- 9.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over CT in treatments with residue
   returned (i.e., NT+ compared with CT+), and by 60.1 +/- 13.8 g C m(-2)
   yr(-1) over CT in treatments with residue removed (i.e., NT- compared
   with CT-). Residue return in NT+ plots did not increase SOC relative to
   NT- plots (23.0 +/- 12.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1), N.S.), but residue return to
   the CT+ plots resulted in a significant increase in SOC of 34.8 +/- 11.1
   g C m(-2) yr(-1) over SOC content in CT- plots. The greatest difference
   in SOC content was found between the CT- and NT+ treatments (83.1 +/-
   10.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Our results indicate that there may be a rapid
   cycling of the aboveground C4-C back to the atmosphere as CO, or lost as
   dissolved organic C from the soil profile. Such a rapid cycling of
   returned C4-C suggests that the annual return of aboveground biomass may
   not increase soil C storage over the long term once soils have reached a
   steady-state SOC level.}},

Abstract = {{Current management and harvesting practices can compact forest soils and
   degrade soil health. However, effects of soil compaction on microbial
   processes and composition are poorly understood. We measured microbial
   community responses to compaction in a sandy loam and a clay loam soil
   under laboratory and field conditions. Treatments of no, moderate
   (approximately 20\% increase in bulk density), and severe (approximately
   40\% increase) compaction were manually applied to intact soil cores. A
   67-d laboratory experiment, punctuated by four sampling dates, was used
   to evaluate microbial indices (biomass, respiration, total and
   culturable bacteria and fungi, N mineralization, surface CO2 efflux, C
   use (Biolog), and phospholipid fatty acids {[}PLFA]) and their
   relationship to soil physical properties (bulk density, pore-size
   distribution, water-holding capacity {[}WHC], gas diffusion). Macropores
   (>30 mum diam.) were reduced 50 to 90\% in compacted samples. In
   contrast, habitable-sized pores for microorganisms (0.2-30 mum diam.)
   increased at least 40\% in both soils with compaction. Despite these
   changes, microbial measures were either unaffected by compaction or
   showed inconsistent increases (e.g., fungal hyphae, C use, total PLFA)
   across sampling periods and soil types. Surface CO2 efflux was reduced
   34 to 51\% in severe compaction samples. Minimal changes in microbial
   respiration indicate that reduced efflux was due to restricted gas
   diffusion. Microbial indifference to compaction also was verified at two
   mixed-conifer plantations in northern California. Soil strength values,
   ranging from 75 to 3800 kPa (no to severe compaction), were unrelated to
   either microbial respiration or biomass. The results show broad
   tolerance of microbial communities from contrasting soil textures to
   compaction, and indicate a poor link between physical and biological
   indices of soil health.}},

Abstract = {{The soil borne parasitic nematodes can destroy the root system of a
   great number of Solanacea species. This aim of our study was to
   investigate the effects of selected organic amendments on the population
   dynamics of the potato cyst nematode Globodera spp. and related soil
   enzymatic activities. The organic amendments used were urea, chitosan,
   sheep manure and chicken litter and the nematicide was Cadusafos.
   Chitinase activity has increased sharply especially with chitosan and
   chicken litter application. All the amendment materials tested reduced
   the potato cyst nematode population, especially urea and chitinous
   material, due to ammonium. These results show that the biological
   properties of a soil are sensitive to environmental stress. Management
   practices, such as adding organic amendments, can help prevent soil
   borne pathogens and improve soil quality and health.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread occurrence of second-generation problems, such as over-mining
   of soil nutrients, decline in factor productivity, reduction in
   profitability, lowering of groundwater tables and build up of pests
   including weeds, diseases and insects has been reported during
   post-green revolution era in most of the intensively cultivated,
   high-productivity, cereal-based production systems, which are
   threatening their sustainability. The research results during the last 2
   decades have clearly established that these adverse impacts of green
   revolution technologies may be mitigated through an appropriate choice
   of alternative crops and cropping systems, which are efficient user of
   resource base (land, water, light and energy), economically more
   remunerative and environment-friendly. An adoption of well-designed
   situation-specific alternative cropping systems along with appropriate
   method of cultivation could minimize the occurrence or intensity of
   diseases and insect pests, including weeds, considerably. These are also
   helpful in conservation of the soil resource, improvement of soil health
   and protection of the environment by minimizing nitrate leaching,
   besides improving nutrient and water-use efficiencies. System-based
   integrated nutrient management, integrated pest management and resource
   conservation technologies such as, zero tillage, furrow-irrigated raised
   bed, and ridge or bed planting are some of the new technologies
   deserving immediate focus. The suggested strategies of immediate concern
   are complementary intensive intercropping systems under limited water
   availability, quantification of on-farm impacts of diversification
   options on productivity, stability, profitability, soil health, water
   and nutrient-use productivity development of sustainable production
   models using computer software, organic fanning systems, focus on
   system-based integrated resource management, development of
   site-specific precision input management and resource-conservation
   technologies, appropriate policies for multi-disciplinary research
   through inter-institutional and or inter-organizational collaborative
   programmes, and development of appropriate decision-support systems for
   diversification options and resource-use optimization under variable
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Soil health refers to the biological, chemical, and physical features of
   soil that are essential to long-term, sustainable agricultural
   productivity with minimal environmental impact. Thus, soil health
   provides an overall picture of soil functionality. Although it cannot be
   measured directly, soil health can be inferred by measuring specific
   soil properties (e.g. organic matter content) and by observing soil
   status (e.g. fertility). There is also increased interest in studying
   soil microorganisms in their particular environments, as microbial
   diversity is intimately related to soil structure and function. One of
   the key objectives in determining soil health is to acquire indicators
   that can be used to evaluate the soil's current status and hence to
   develop sustainable agricultural systems. In this regard, significant
   progress has been made over the last few years in the development of
   specific biomarkers and macromolecular probes, enabling rapid and
   reliable measurements of soil microbial communities. Ill addition,
   modern molecular biological techniques, such as fluorescence in situ
   hybridization (FISH), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and terminal
   restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), have facilitated the
   analysis of microbial biodiversity and activity, whereas the application
   of modern analytical techniques, Such as nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) and pyrolysisgas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS), have
   provided data on soil chemistry. The combination of these two approaches
   offers promise in determining soil health status.}},

Abstract = {{Soils with specific suppressiveness to plant-parasitic nematodes are of
   interest to define the mechanisms that regulate population density.
   Suppressive soils prevent nematodes from establishing and from causing
   disease, and they diminish disease severity after initial nematode
   damage in continuous Culturing of a host. A range of non-specific and
   specific soil treatments, followed by infestation with a target
   nematode, have been employed to identify nematode-suppressive soils.
   Biocidal treatments, soil transfer tests, and baiting approaches
   together with observations of the plant-parasitic nematode in the root
   zone of susceptible host plants have improved the understanding of
   nematode-suppressive soils. Techniques to demonstrate specific soil
   suppressiveness against plant-parasitic nematodes are compared in this
   review. The overlap Of Studies on soil suppressiveness with recent
   advances in soil health and quality is briefly discussed. The emphasis
   is on methods (or criteria) used to detect and identify soils that
   maintain specific soil suppressiveness to plant-parasitic nematodes.
   While biocidal treatments can detect general and specific soil
   suppressiveness, soil transfer studies, by definition, apply only to
   specific soil suppressiveness. Finally, potential strategies to exploit
   suppressive soils are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive tillage for annual crop production may be affecting soil
   health and quality. However, tillage intensity effects on biological
   activities of volcanic-derived soils have not been systematically
   investigated. We evaluated the effects of three different tillage
   practices on some biological activities of an Ultisol from southern
   Chile during the third year of a wheat-lupin-wheat crop sequence.
   Treatments were: no tillage with stubble burning (NTB), no tillage
   without stubble burning (NT) and conventional tillage with
   disk-harrowing and stubble burning (CT). Biological activities were
   evaluated in winter and summer at 0-200 mm and at three soil depths
   (0-50, 50-100 and 100-200 mm) in winter. Total organic C and N were
   significantly higher under no-tillage systems than CT. In general, NT
   increased C and N of microbial biomass in comparison with CT, especially
   in winter. Microbial biomass C was closely associated with microbial
   biomass N (r = 0.986, P < 0.05); acid phosphomonoesterase (r = 0.999, P
   < 0.05); P-glucosidase (r = 0.978, P < 0.05), and others. Changes in
   biological activities occur-red mainly in the upper soil layer (0-50 mm
   depth) in spite of the short duration of the experiment. Biological
   activities could be used as practical biological indicators to apply the
   more appropriate management systems for increasing soil sustainability
   or productivity. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Yield constraints have become an important feature of sugarcane farming
   systems in Australia, with significant yield increases obtainable by
   manipulating farming system components (e.g. crop rotation). However, to
   identify key crop targets for new farming systems, an improved
   understanding of the physiological mechanisms mediating these yield
   responses is required. Data from experiments investigating impacts of
   crop rotation, plant population, tillage and trash management have been
   analysed to determine the impact of treatments on shoot and stalk
   dynamics and crop yield.
   Crop rotation or soil fumigation resulted in significantly improved crop
   establishment, with production of greater numbers of both primary and
   higher order shoots. Manipulation of soil N status in these experiments
   had limited effect on the initiation of secondary tillers, regardless of
   whether the N was the result of a rotation treatment or of fertiliser N
   applications within a common rotation history. In all cases, effects of
   N were minimal compared to those of other components of soil health
   affected by fumigation (primarily detrimental soil biota) and rotation
   (differing elements of physical and chemical fertility and soil biota).
   Survival of tillers until final harvest was strongly influenced by the
   population density of established primary shoots and the growing
   conditions during the latter part of the growing season. Reduced water
   stress and application of N fertiliser near the time of maximum tiller
   numbers increased tiller survival.
   The relative importance of final stalk population density and individual
   stalk dry mass to variation in yield in each experiment, varied widely.
   The cultivar Q 117, which was used in experiments in northern regions of
   Mackay, Burdekin and Tully, achieved relatively low final stalk
   densities (4-8 stalks m(-2)) and yield variation in these experiments
   was primarily due to treatment effects on this attribute. Experiments in
   the south at Bundaberg used a number of cultivars (Q124, Q141, Q188)
   which all achieved higher stalk population densities (9-12 stalks m(-2))
   with yield variation primarily affected by individual stalk mass.
   Experiments designed to broaden the range of plant densities tested
   revealed a negative relationship between individual stalk mass and stalk
   population density. These data show that treatments that increase stalk
   population densities at harvest without also increasing rates of dry
   matter accumulation during stalk filling are unlikely to increase
   yields. Improvements in soil health afforded by crop rotation and soil
   fumigation deliver yield benefits by achieving both higher population
   densities and heavier stalks. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Arid legumes are recognized for taming droughts, sustaining soil health
   and diversifying agriculture and for providing organic food, feed and
   variety of products of industrial use of export value. Considerable
   research results have been generated at various levels for making them
   more productive. In moth bean {[} Vigna aconitifolia (Jacq) Marechal],
   varieties maturing in 58-60 ('FMM 96'), 61-64 ('RMO 40', `RMO 225',
   `CAZRI Moth Y), 65-67 ('CAZRI Moth 2{''} and 7075 ('CAZRI Moth 3',
   `Jawala', `IPCMO 880') days having erect, semi-crect and semi-spreading
   types, respectively, compared with traditional types maturing in 90-100
   days with spreading behaviour, have been developed. These varieties,
   suited to various rainfall situation of 150-500 mm, are highly
   productive (500-800 kg/ha) with tendency to escape yellow mosaic virus
   and drought. In horsegram {[}Macrotyloma uniflorum (Lain.) Verd.] also,
   varieties maturing in 80-85 days ('AK 21', `AK 42') compared with
   traditional ones maturing in 100-110 days have been developed. Promising
   varieties in clusterbean or guar {[}Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.)
   Taubert] ('RGC 986', `RGC 1003', `RGC 1002', `RGC 1017', `RGM 112') and
   in cowpea {[}Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp] ('GC 3', `V 585', `V 240', `RC
   101', `CoVu 702') have been developed, showing improved grain yield and
   field tolerance to important diseases. Large number of varieties
   available in active seed chain (35-40) owe their origin from germplasm
   collected from various situations. Promising donor of diseases arid
   insect-pests are available in cowpea. Workable indices of practical
   significance for drought tolerance have been provided in moth bean and
   cowpea. Genetical studies revealed preponderance of both additive and
   non-additive gene effects for important yield traits arid grain yield,
   however quality traits are less complex. Clusterbean or guar-wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.emend. Fiori \& Paol) or guar-Indian mustard
   {[}Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. \& Cosson] sequences, proved quite
   profitable in north India. In Southern states, growing short-duration
   horsegram with rice (Oryza saliva L.) by replacing cowpca is useful arid
   in Orissa horsegram is successfully taken after rice or maize or sorghum
   {[}Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] crops.
   Beneficial effects of intercropping clusterbean with pearlmillet
   {[}Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. emend. Stuntz] sorghum, maize and
   castor (Ricinus communis L.) have been observed at various places.
   Intercropping I or 2 rows of cowpea between 2 rows of pigeonpea, maize,
   pearl millet or sorghum have ensured success of crops without loss to
   the main crop. Mixing of moth bean and pearl millet seeds (as two-thirds
   and one-third of recommended dose, respectively) resulted in highest
   moth bean equivalent grain yield even under late-sown rainfed conditions
   of Rajasthan. Moth bean kept weed-free up to 20-25 days after sowing
   gave satisfactory grain yield, Among chemical weedicides, Basalin @ 1 kg
   ai/ha effectively controlled weeds in moth bean and guar. In cowpea
   Pendemethalin @ 0.75 kg/ha + 1 hand-weeding at 35 days after sowing gave
   least weed index (18.0), higher grain yield (502 kg/ha) and benefit:
   cost ratio (1.69) than weeded check. Bacteria] leaf blight (Xanthomonas
   axonopodis pv cyamopsidis Patel), alternaria leaf spot (Alternaria
   cucumerina var cyamopsidis), anthracnose (Collelotrichum lindemuthianum
   (Sacc. \& Magn.) Bri. \& Cav.], dry root rot {[}Macrophomina phaseolina
   (Tassi) Goid], powdery mildew {[}Odiopsis taurica (Lev.) Sain], fusarium
   wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f sp tracheiphilum), yellow mosaic virus arid
   cowpea yellow mosaic virus are important diseases of and legumes,
   causing considerable yield loss (10-95\%). Control measures through
   chemical, organic and biological means have been developed. Among
   insects, more than 25\% yield losses have been observed due to storage
   beetles or bruchids (Callosobruchus maculatus Fab.). Edible oil
   treatment (8 ml/kg seed) proved effective up to 150-200 days against
   storage pests. Pod-borer {[}Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner)] is another
   main pest damaging cowpea and horsegram. Spray of 0.07\% endosulphan @
   700 litres/ha has been effective to check the same. Galactomannan guar
   gum, a polysaccharide compound, is used in a number of industries where
   water is an important factor. Cluster bean varieties with higher gum
   content (> 32\%) and high viscosity (4000-5000 mps.a) are preferred for
   export. Clusterbean meal obtained from seed coat and germ cell is
   important feed of monogastric animals and has high proportion of protein
   content (45-50\%). Cowpea and moth bean varieties having almost 27 and
   25-26\% grain protein are available, whereas horsegram varieties may
   contain even up to 30\% crude protein.}},

Abstract = {{Glyphosate is a commonly used herbicide in grassland soils and
   microorganisms control its degradation. We introduce the concept of
   using the degradation rate as an indicator for ecosystem health. Testing
   this concept, we used soils with a long history of heavy metal pollution
   (Cu, Pb, and Zn). We hypothesized lower degradation rates in
   metal-polluted compared to less polluted soils. The degradation rates
   were measured by repeated measurements of the parent compound in spiked
   soil-water slurries incubated at 20 \&DEG; C over 21 days. Average rates
   showed no differences comparing among soils. We observed a positive
   correlation between glyphosate degradation rates and soil metal
   pollution. Therefore, we concluded that the expected impact of the
   metals on the bacteria responsible for the herbicide degradation was not
   established. We discuss the potential influence on biological
   degradation rates of soil pH and adsorption and implications using the
   concept of the soil health indicator. \&COPY; 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Field experiments were conducted at Ashland Bottoms in northeastern
   Kansas and at Hays in western Kansas in 2001, 2002, and 2003 to
   determine the response of soil microbial and nematode communities to
   different herbicides and tillage practices under a glyphosate-resistant
   cropping system. Conventional herbicide treatments were a tank mixture
   of cloransulam plus S metolachlor plus sulfentrazone for soybean and a
   commercially available mixture of acetochlor and atrazine for corn.
   Glyphosate was applied at 1.12 kg ai ha(-1) when weeds were 10 or 20 cm
   tall in both corn and soybean. Soil samples were collected monthly at
   Ashland Bottoms during the growing period for soil microbial biomass
   (SMB) carbon determination. In addition, substrate-induced respiration
   (SIR) and BIOLOG substrate utilization were determined at the end of the
   growing season each year at Ashland Bottoms, and nematode populations
   were determined at the beginning and the end of the growing season at
   both sites. Direct effects of glyphosate rates on soil microbial and
   nematode communities were also studied in a controlled environment.
   Values for SMB carbon, SIR, and BIOLOG substrate utilization were not
   altered by glyphosate. Nematode community response to the glyphosate
   treatment was similar under both conventional tillage and no-till
   environments. Total nematode densities were similar with the glyphosate
   and conventional herbicide treatments. SMB carbon and BIOLOG substrate
   utilization did not differ between tillage treatments. Nematode
   densities were greater under conventional tillage than in the no-till
   system. This study showed that soil health when glyphosate was applied
   in a glyphosate-resistant cropping system was similar to that of
   cropping systems that used conventional herbicides.}},

Abstract = {{Junipers (Juniperus spp.) are native woody shrubs that have expanded
   beyond their normal historical ranges in the western and southwestern
   United States since the late 1800s. Most ecologists and resource
   managers agree that juniper has become a deleterious native invasive
   plant that threatens other vegetation ecosystems, such as grasslands,
   through a steady encroachment and ultimate domination. The use of fire
   in managing junipers is based on a management goal to increase the
   disturbance return interval and thereby reduce the abundance and/or
   competitive impact of juniper in an ecosystem. In this paper, we discuss
   rates of juniper encroachment in relation to presettlement fire regimes,
   juniper encroachment and soil health, postfire vegetation responses, and
   long-term potential of different juniper treatment scenarios that
   involve prescribed fire.}},

Abstract = {{The global necessity to increase agricultural production from a steadily
   decreasing and degrading land resource base has placed considerable
   strain on the fragile agro-ecosystems. Current strategies to maintain
   and improve agricultural productivity via high-input practices places
   considerable emphasis on `fail-safe' techniques for each component of
   the production sequence with little consideration to the integration of
   these components in a holistic, systems approach. While the use of
   mineral fertilizers is considered the quickest and surest way of
   boosting crop production, their cost and other constraints deter farmers
   from using them in recommended quantities. In recent years, concepts of
   integrated plant nutrient management (IPNM) have been developed, which
   emphasize maintaining and increasing soil fertility by optimizing all
   possible sources (organic and inorganic) of plant nutrients required for
   crop growth and quality. This is done in an integrated manner
   appropriate to each cropping system and farming situation. Improvement
   in agricultural sustainability requires optimal use and management of
   soil fertility and soil physical properties, both of which rely on soil
   biological processes and soil biodiversity. An understanding of
   microbial diversity perspectives in agricultural context, is important
   and useful to arrive at measures that can act as indicators of soil
   quality and plant productivity. In this context, the long-lasting
   challenges in soil microbiology are development of effective methods to
   know the types of microorganisms present in soils, and to determine
   functions which the microbes perform in situ. This review describes some
   recent developments, particularly in India, to understand the
   relationship of soils and plants with the diversity of associated
   bacteria, and traces contributions of Indian scientists in isolating and
   defining the roles of plant growth promoting bacteria to evolve
   strategies for their better exploitation.}},

Abstract = {{The soil status inside and outside the chemical ACNA factory (Cengio,
   Italy) has been investigated by assessing chemical and biological
   parameters. Three sites, two (A and B) located inside the so-called
   high-risk zone and one (C) outside the factory were considered. Chemical
   analysis performed in the first metre of depth indicated the presence of
   inorganic pollution (copper and arsenic) in site A and organic
   (1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene and 2,4-dichloroaniline) and inorganic
   (arsenic and mercury) contaminations in site B. Site C did not show any
   significant contamination and was considered as control. Biological
   analyses were performed by evaluating functional (substrate utilization
   pattern and enzymatic activities of the soil extracts) and structural
   (bacterial population density, composition and structure) diversity of
   the soil bacterial community as indicator of soil health. Moreover, 20
   bacterial strains per site, able to grow on minimal medium added with
   2,4-dichloroaniline as sole carbon source, were selected and identified.
   The metabolic profile of soil extracts, characterized by using Biolog GN
   MicroPlates, coupled with hierarchical clustering, showed a high
   similarity between the microbial communities isolated from sites A and
   B. The highest amounts of enzymatic activities were recorded in site C.
   Bacterial density in all sites did not differ significantly and a
   prevalence of r-strategist (fast growing and copiotrophic) bacteria was
   observed. The composition of the bacterial community showed a higher
   similarity between sites A and B than with site C. Only few bacterial
   species were common to the three sites: as a consequence, a prevalence
   of bacterial species typically associated to each site was observed. The
   fraction of bacteria able to grow on 2,4-dichloroaniline as sole carbon
   source on the total culturable bacteria in each site was lower than
   0.1\%. Bacterial identifications were performed by using Biolog
   MicroPlates. By considering the bacterial strains able to grow on
   minimal medium added with 2,4-dichloroaniline, a higher similarity
   between sites A and C than with B site was recorded. In conclusion, the
   presence of different chemical pollutants did not affect the bacterial
   density but rather the community structure. The characterization of soil
   chemical properties, metabolic fingerprinting, enzymatic activities and
   bacterial community structure could be useful tools for the evaluation
   of the soil health. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Adoption of conservation tillage for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)
   increased a modest 5.5 percent from 1992 to 1998 despite the evidence of
   the benefits to erosion control, soil health, and associated natural
   resources derived from conservation tillage. The Monsanto Centers of
   Excellence were established to evaluate the potential benefits of
   conservation tillage across a range of soils and climates. Our objective
   is to summarize the results from field-scale studies conducted at 12
   Centers of Excellence sites in seven states from 1998 through 2002.
   No-tillage, strip tillage, reduced tillage and conventional tillage
   cotton production were evaluated in this study. All sites had a
   no-tillage and conventional tillage system, while eight of the 12 sites
   had a reduced tillage system and two of the 12 sites had a strip tillage
   system. Differences among tillage systems within a site did not show any
   significant effects on soil quality indicators. The variability within a
   site was quite large due to the limited number of samples collected at
   each location and the short-period of record covered by the study. Lint
   yield differences between no-tillage, strip tillage, reduced tillage,
   and conventional tillage systems were not significant. The 5-year
   average profit for the no-tillage system ranged from \$17 to \$164
   ha(-1) (\$7 to \$66 ac(-1)) higher than the other 3 systems. Even though
   these differences were not significant because of large variations in
   environment, soil type, and production practices between sites and years
   the profit was always positive for no-till systems compared to other
   tillage systems. We conclude that farmers, crop consultants, and others
   should carefully consider overall profit rather than just crop yield
   when evaluating alternative tillage practices.}},

Abstract = {{The clearing land of trees and introduction of exotic pastures to
   enhance pasture production and associated monetary gains has been a
   common practise in Queensland. Previous studies on tree clearing
   emphasised the gains in pasture production. but over periods of less
   than 10-15 years after clearing, thus potentially misleading land
   managers who plan to continue grazing beyond that time. The present
   research follows an integrated approach to quantify the pasture yield
   and the effects of tree clearing on pasture species composition, soil
   properties (organic carbon, available N (NO3-) pH(w) and microbial
   biomass (C and N)), and litter production over time-since-clearing on a
   grazing property in central Queensland, and to evaluate the implications
   of our findings for the region. The cleared pasture systems were taken
   at < 5, 11-13 and > 33 year age of clearing in comparison to their
   paired uncleared pastures for three major tree communities
   representative of the region: Eucalyptus populnea, Eucalyptus
   melanophloia and Acacia harpophylla. The paper evaluates the effects of
   clearing on individual attributes as well as an integrated effect of
   these attributes, i.e. overall ecological services. Pasture production
   generally increased with clearing but plant diversity, litter production
   and potential return of N and P through litter decreased. Among soil
   attributes, clearing of trees adversely impacted upon soil pH and
   microbial biomass, which play an important role in nutrient availability
   and mineralisation. This, the initial gains in pasture production are
   not sustainable over time. The multivariate analysis for such ecological
   attributes suggests that at the > 33 year age of clearing, the
   ecological state of pasture systems changed compared to that at 5 year
   or 11-13 year or to the uncleared system. A disturbed pasture system
   will most likely take longer to revert to the original state compared to
   the time that would have taken to harvest the benefits. The results are
   important for landholders and policy makers to comprehend the real gains
   and losses following tree clearing for pasture development over the long
   term. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},

Abstract = {{Use of organic amendments such as farmyard manure (FYM), green manure
   (GM) and crop residues is important to improve soil health and reduce
   the dependence on synthetic chemical fertilizer. However, these organic
   amendments also effect the emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) from soil.
   Influence of different organic amendments on emissions of GHG from soil
   and their global warming potential (GWP) was studied in a field
   experiment in rice-wheat cropping system of Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP).
   There was 28\% increase in CH4 emissions on addition of 25\% N through
   Sesbania GM along with urea compared to urea alone. Substitution of
   100\% inorganic N by organic sources lead to a 60\% increase in CH4
   emissions. The carbon equivalent emission from rice-wheat systems varied
   between 3816 and 4886 kg C equivalent ha(-1) depending upon fertilizer
   and organic amendment. GWP of rice-wheat system increased by 28\% on
   full substitution of organic N by chemical N. However, the C efficiency
   ratios of the GM and crop residue treatments were at par with the
   recommended inorganic fertilizer treatment. Thus use of organic
   amendments along with inorganic fertilizer increases the GWP of the
   rice-wheat system but may improve the soil fertility status without
   adversely affecting the C efficiency ratio. However, the trade-off

Abstract = {{Natural resource management calls for study of natural system prevailing
   in the country. In India floods and droughts visit regularly, causing
   extensive damages of natural wealth including agriculture that are
   crucial for sustenance of economic growth. The Indian Sub-continent
   drained by many major rivers and their tributaries where watershed, the
   hydrological unit forms a natural system that allows management and
   development of land resources following natural harmony.
   Acquisition of various kinds and levels of soil and land characteristics
   using both conventional and remote sensing techniques and subsequent
   development of digital spatial data base are essential to evolve
   strategy for planning watershed development programmes, their monitoring
   and impact evaluation. The multi-temporal capability of remote sensing
   sensors helps to update the existing data base which are of dynamic in
   nature.
   The paper outlines the concept of spatial data base development,
   generation using remote sensing techniques, designing of data structure,
   standardization and integration with watershed layers and various non
   spatial attribute data for various applications covering watershed
   development planning, alternate land use planning, soil and water
   conservation, diversified agriculture practices, generation of soil
   health card, soil and land reclamation, etc. The soil and land
   characteristics are vital to derive various interpretative groupings or
   master table that helps to generate the desired level of information of
   various clients using the GIS platform.
   The digital spatial data base on soils and watersheds generated by All
   India Soil and Land Use Survey will act as a sub-server of the main GIS
   based Web Server being hoisted by the planning commission for
   application of spatial data for planning purposes under G2G domain. It
   will facilitate e-governance for natural resource management using modem
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative study of organic and conventional arable farming systems
   was conducted in The Netherlands to determine the effect of management
   practices on chemical and biological soil properties and soil health.
   Soils from thirteen accredited organic farms and conventionally managed
   neighboring farms were analyzed using a polyphasic approach combining
   traditional soil analysis, culture-dependent and independent
   microbiological analyses, a nematode community analysis and an enquiry
   about different management practices among the farmers. Organic
   management, known primarily for the abstinence of artificial fertilizers
   and pesticides, resulted in significantly lower levels of both nitrate
   and total soluble nitrogen in the soil, higher numbers of bacteria of
   different trophic groups, as well as larger species richness in both
   bacteria and nematode communities and more resilience to a
   drying-rewetting disturbance in the soil. The organic farmers plough
   their fields less deeply and tend to apply more organic carbon to their
   fields, but this did not result in a significantly higher organic carbon
   content in their soils. The levels of ammonium, organic nitrogen,
   phosphate and total phosphorus did not differ, significantly between the
   soils under different management. Fifty percent of the conventional
   Dutch farmers also used organic fertilizers and the numbers of farmers
   using a green crop fertilizer did not differ between the two management
   types. Soil type - clayey or sandy soil - in general had a much stronger
   effect on the soil characteristics than management type. The soil type
   influenced pH, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate and organic carbon levels as
   well as numbers of oligotrophic bacteria and of different groups of
   nematodes, and different diversity indices. With the collected data set
   certain soil characteristics could also be attributed to the use of
   different management practices like plow depth, crop or cover crop type
   or to the management history of the soil. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In the pursuit of commercial solutions for environmental issues,
   individual problems are often identified, considered and resolved in
   isolation from other environmental matters and always at the end of the
   cycle - after the problem has been created.
   Inter-relationships are neglected if they are not seen to obviously
   impact on a specific problem and the issue at hand is plucked from the
   environmental landscape and dealt with in total isolation to all else.
   In a Zero Waste approach to environmental matters, all outputs are
   pursued as potential inputs. Industrial processes are viewed as a
   variation on nature's theme and opportunity pursued above all else.
   When viewed from this perspective, industry appears to have forgotten
   its origins. It has forgotten that it is principally about people. The
   juggernaut of global trade has forgotten that it is a small part of a
   big landscape and that its principal participants, people, cannot exist
   without healthy soil.
   Commercial activity in all parts of the world relies heavily on the
   ability of agriculture to produce the necessary inputs for industrial
   production.
   The care and nurturing of our soils is fundamental, not only to the
   survival of humanity, but also to the economic systems that support that
   humanity and to the industry which profits by it.
   Actual levels of domestic recycling in many countries around the world
   seldom reflect the 90 plus per cent desire to recycle recorded in
   surveys conducted by local authorities in almost every country.
   If the desire to recycle is far removed from the end result, why is it
   that the systems provided are so ineffective? It is obvious that what we
   do need is a recycling system that both engages and rewards the
   participant and stimulates the innate desire to support the environment.
   A recent trial in New South Wales, Australia, demonstrated that by
   giving individual households credits for recycling organic wastes, not
   only will contamination levels fall dramatically, but increased yields,
   improved soil structure, improved land values, reduced fertiliser costs
   and increased water use efficiency give the farmer good economic reasons
   for purchasing and applying quality composted product.
   By under-pinning and securing the agricultural community, we secure the
   future of industry.
   The `City to Soil' project linked the economic on-farm benefits of
   compost use with reduced contamination through the provision of rewards
   paid for by the purchase of product by the farmer.}},

   Incorporation of rice residues in wheat and wheat residues in rice not

   of rice and wheat but also increased the nutrient uptake (18.5 kg
   nitrogen, 3.6 kg phosphorus and 19.6 kg potassium/ha) compared to
   without residue incorporation besides improved the physico-chemical and
   microbiological properties of the soil. Alternatively the incorporation
   of flyash and left over stubbles of previous crops as residues were
   equally found effective in increasing the productivity by 13.5 and
   8.1\%, respectively and soil environment in rice-wheat cropping system
   over without residue incorporation. Application of Trichoderma viride +
   20 kg N/ha or farmyard manure (5 tonnes/ha) as starter dose for quick

Abstract = {{There is a common understanding that the widely used herbicide
   glyphosate is easily degraded and adsorbed in soils and thus, harmless
   for use in agriculture. We can demonstrate, however, that this
   conclusion is wrong and dangerous for farmers because in former risk
   assessments the behaviour of glyphosate in the rhizosphere was not
   properly considered.
   In nutrient solution, rhizobox and pot experiments we can show that
   foliar applied glyphosate to target plants is released into the
   rhizosphere after a fast translocation from shoots to roots. In the
   rhizosphere glyphosate can obviously be stabilized long enough to
   achieve negative effects on non-target plants. Such a negative side
   effect is for example inhibited acquisition of micronutrients such as
   Mn, but also Zn, Fe and B, which are involved in plant own disease
   resistance mechanisms.
   From this glyphosate transfer from target to non-target plants (e.g.
   from weed to trees in orchards) we predict an increase in disease
   problems, particularly on soils with low micronutrient availability as
   already reported in the USA. In view of plant and soil health, we
   urgently call for a re-assessment of glyphosate as herbicide.}},

Abstract = {{Fabricated soil (FS) is a natural mixture of decaying substrates rich in
   alumni-silicate, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium Sources.
   This substrate usually is used for landscape rehabilitation and is an
   excellent source and example of environmental remediation. We studied
   the use and application of FS in Western Pennsylvanian soils, areas that
   were previously degraded by acid mining drainage. We are still trying to
   determine if fabricated soils are a long-term or short-term solution to
   the problem. This soil was tested on its Fertility and then applied to
   mining substrate. After one year, the first weed plants on the soil
   appeared in May 2003. The composition of the weeds on the fabricated
   plots was determined. After the exposure of FS into the natural habitat
   for the duration of three years, we also evaluated bacterial and fungal
   activity in the soil as this is an important indicator of soil health.}},

Abstract = {{The design of a rigorous experimental procedure is the basis for any
   environmental study. In this work, the basic criteria are established
   for determination of soil health using microcalorimetry as the main
   technique complemented by the study of physical (temperature, moisture,
   porosity, hydraulic conductivity, density and plasticity), chemical (pH
   and C to N ratio) and biological features (most probable number of
   microorganisms and organic matter content), and also environmental
   properties in the form of bioclimatic diagrams. The design was
   elaborated using as a reference a humic eutrophic-Cambisol subjected to
   afforestation with P. pinaster Aiton situated in Viveiro (Galicia, NW
   Spain). Main results of this study refer to total heat evolved during
   the processes (2.65 to 3.81 J g(-1)), time to reach the maximum of the
   peak from 16.17 to 19.29 h, and microbial growth rate constant from
   0.0732 to 0.1043 h(-1). These results change over the year as they are
   influenced by the action of environmental parameters over soil microbial
   activity. The results are in close agreement with some others previously
   reported using different experimental techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses the possible role of amygdalin, a cyanoglucoside,
   on the replant disease of Prunus crops. The allelopathic effects of
   amygdalin on Nemaguard (P. persica x P. davidiana) seedlings were
   assessed by growing seedlings in containers with different soil
   treatments reflecting increasing levels of amygdalin. Treatments were as
   follows: healthy soil (control), healthy soil plus amygdalin at 0, 500,
   1000 and 2000 mg L-1; bitter almond seed extract; roots extract of adult
   Nemaguard trees, a combination of the last two treatments and a
   ``replant disease{''} soil taken from an old peach orchard possessing an
   amygdalin content of 258.6 mg L-1 (14.7 mg L-1 of cyanide). The putative
   autoallelopathy was assessed by effects on plant height, trunk diameter,
   total dry matter and root length. The residual content of cyanides in
   the soil was determined at the end of the assay. There was a substantial
   growth inhibition with amygdalin treatments on all growth variables
   measured, with the level of inhibition increasing with the concentration
   of the soil-associated amygdalin. A curvilinear relationship between
   amygdalin concentration (x) and levels of cyanide (y) in the soil
   (described by the equation: y = -8(.)10(-07) x(2) + 0.0031x + 0.0546;
   R-2 = 0.96) was established. Cyanide concentration was about four-fold
   greater in ``replant disease{''} soil than in control soils. Results
   provide evidence for the involvement of an amygdalin-associated
   autoalleopathic factor in the replant disease of Prunus crops.}},

Abstract = {{The extent of soil microbial diversity is seen to be critical to the
   maintenance of soil health and quality. Different agricultural practices
   are able to affect soil microbial diversity and thus the level of
   suppressiveness of plant diseases. In a 4-year field experiment, we
   investigated the microbial diversity of soil under different
   agricultural regimes. We studied permanent grassland, grassland turned
   into arable land, long-term arable land and arable land turned into
   grassland. The diversity of microbial communities was described by using
   cultivation-based and cultivation-independent methods. Both types of
   methods revealed differences in the diversities of soil microbial
   communities between different treatments. The treatments with higher
   above-ground biodiversity generally maintained higher levels of
   microbial diversity. Moreover, a positive correlation between
   suppression of Rhizoctonia solani AG3 and microbial diversity was
   observed. Permanent (species-rich) grassland and grassland turned into
   maize stimulated higher microbial diversities and higher levels of
   suppressiveness of R. solani AG3 compared with the long-term arable
   land. Effects of agricultural practices on Bacillus and Pseudomonas
   communities were also observed and clear correlations between the levels
   of suppressiveness and the diversities of these bacterial groups were
   found. This study highlighted the importance of agricultural management
   regime for soil microbial community structure and diversity as well as
   the level of soil suppressiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Six-hundred bacterial strains from human milk and milk from Sahiwal
   cows, Holstein Friesian cows, and buffaloes were screened for their
   ability to suppress phytopathogenic fungi under in vitro conditions. A
   consortium of 3 strains, viz., Bacillus lentimorbus B-30486 (B-30486),
   B. subtilis B-30487 (B-30487), and B. lentimorbus B-30488 (B-30488),
   isolated from Sahiwal cow milk resulted in better biological control and
   plant-growth promotion than single-strain treatments. For
   commercial-scale production of a bioinoculant, the solid-state
   fermentation of sugarcane agro-industrial residues, i.e., molasses,
   press mud, and spent wash, using the consortium of B-30486, B-30487, and
   B-30488, resulted in a value-added product, useful for enhancing plant
   growth. The application of the consortium to sugarcane fields infested
   with Fusarium moniliforme and Colletotrichum falcatum resulted in a
   reduction of mortality and significantly higher (P=0.05) plant height,
   number of tillers, and cane girth when compared with the control.
   Furthermore, under field conditions, the treatment of sugarcane with the
   consortium resulted in significantly (P=0.05) greater plant growth
   compared with nonbacterized plants. Accordingly, this is the first
   report on the effective use of bacteria isolated from milk for
   biological control and enhancing plant growth under field conditions.
   Furthormore, a solid-state fermentation technology was developed that
   facilitates the economic utilization of agro-industrial residues for
   environmental conservation and improving plant and soil health.}},

Abstract = {{Comparisons of organic and inorganic fertilizer effects on nematode
   communities depend on the specific organic fertilizer used. Field
   experiments were conducted during 2001 and 2002 in a squash (Cucurbita
   pepo) agroecosystem to determine if applying sunn hemp (Crotalaria
   juncea) hay as an organic fertilizer improved nematode communities
   involved in soil nutrient cycling compared to an equivalent N rate (100
   kg N/ha) of ammonium nitrate. Fertilizer source had minimal effect on
   nematode communities in 2001 when treatments were applied after a winter
   cover crop of oats (Avena sativa), but differences (P <= 0.05) between
   the fertilizer sources occurred in 2002 when no winter cover cropping
   preceded squash. Fertilization with Rum hemp hay increased abundance of
   the bacterivore guilds Ba(1) and Ba(2), and increased fungivores at the
   end of the experiment. Compared to ammonium nitrate, fertilization with
   sunn hemp hay resulted in a community with lower maturity index, higher
   enrichment index, and lower channel index, consistent with a disturbed
   and nutrient-enriched soil food web undergoing bacterial decomposition.
   Sunn hemp hay occasionally stimulated omnivorous nematodes, but
   suppressed plant-parasitic nematodes relative to ammonium nitrate
   fertilizer. Increasing the sunn hemp hay rate to 200 ka N/ha increased
   the abundance of bacterivores, fungivores, and predatory nematodes, and
   total nematode abundance compared to hay at 100 kg N/ha. Fertilization
   with ammonium nitrate increased the percentage of herbivores, but
   reduced percentage and abundance of omnivores. In conclusion, sunn hemp
   fertilizer maintained greater numbers of nematodes involved in nutrient
   cycling as compared to ammonium nitrate. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The ultimate goal of any soil remediation process should be not only to
   remove the contaminant(s) from the polluted site but to restore soil
   health as well. In consequence, reliable indicators of soil health are
   needed if we are to properly evaluate the efficiency of a soil
   remediation process. The aim of the current work was to determine the
   effect of metal phytoextraction, through the utilization of the Zn
   hyperaccumulator T. caerulescens, on biological parameters of soil
   health, on the assumption that biological indicators of soil health
   might be valid monitoring tools to assess the efficiency of a metal
   phytoextraction process. To this end, a short-term microcosm
   phytoextraction study was carried out, with two heavy metal polluted
   soils collected from an abandoned mine, to determine the effect of metal
   phytoextraction on soil biological parameters. Higher values of biomass
   C, basal respiration, substrate induced respiration, and
   beta-glucosidase activity were observed in the presence of T.
   caerulescens plants, as compared to unplanted pots. Our data confirm the
   great capacity of T. caerulescens to phytoextract Zn from polluted soils
   and, interestingly, suggest that metal phytoextraction has indeed a
   beneficial effect on soil biological activity. It was concluded that the
   revegetation of these metal polluted soils with T. caerulescens could
   help activate their biochemical and microbial functionality.}},

Abstract = {{A healthy soil is often defined as a stable soil system with high levels
   of biological diversity and activity, internal nutrient cycling, and
   resilience to disturbance. This implies that microbial fluctuations
   after a disturbance would dampen more quickly in a healthy than in a
   chronically damaged and biologically impoverished soil. Soil could be
   disturbed by various processes, for example addition of a nutrient
   source, tillage, or drying-rewetting. As a result of any disturbance,
   the numbers of heterotrophic bacteria and of individual species start to
   oscillate, both in time and space. The oscillations appear as moving
   waves along the path of a moving nutrient source such as a root tip. The
   phase and period for different trophic groups and species of bacteria
   may be shifted indicating that succession occurs. DGGE, Biolog and FAME
   analysis of subsequent populations in oscillation have confirmed that
   there is a cyclic succession in microbial communities. Microbial
   diversity oscillates in opposite direction from oscillations in
   microbial populations. In a healthy soil, the amplitudes of these
   oscillations will be small, but the background levels of microbial
   diversity and activity are high, so that soil-borne diseases will face
   more competitors and antagonists. However, soil-borne pathogens and
   antagonists alike will fluctuate in time and space as a result of
   growing plant roots and other disturbances, and the periods and phases
   of the oscillations may vary. As a consequence, biological control by
   members of a single trophic group or species may never be complete, as
   pathogens will encounter varying populations of the biocontrol agent on
   the root surface. A mixture of different trophic groups may provide more
   complete biological control because peaks of different trophic groups
   occur at subsequent locations along a root. Alternatively, regular
   addition of soil organic matter may increase background levels of
   microbial activity, increase nutrient cycling, lower the concentrations
   of easily available nutrient sources, increase microbial diversity, and
   enhance natural disease suppression.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, people pay more attention to overgrazing due to its extensive
   damaging effects on ecological systems. How to solve the remarkable
   problem is essentially an important topic. In this paper, setting the
   recovery period of plant population, we simulate the dynamics of
   rangeland grazing pattern with a mathematical model. Using the
   corresponding difference system determined by the model, we obtain the
   critical value of recovery period which is a ratio of the birth rate of
   grazer population during the grazing period to the sum of it and the
   death rate of grazer population during the recovery period. If the
   recovery period is above the critical value, the grazer population will
   become extinct; if the recovery period is below the critical value, we
   obtain the explicit expression of the positive periodic solution which
   is globally stable, i.e. two kinds of population are all persistent.
   Further, we find the maximum of grazer population's density when the
   density of grass population is not below a threshold. Our research
   demonstrates that properly timed grazing plays a key role in protecting
   grassland environment, or say, the recovery period of plant population
   is below the critical value; managed grazing is arguably the only
   natural process by which grassland can be improved on a sustainable
   basis. Controlled grazing can regenerate grassland, preserve healthy
   soil and improve livestock production simultaneously. Our results are
   valuable for rangeland grazing management in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Organic carbon (C) was measured in the silt + clay fraction of 78 soils
   from agricultural areas in Tasmania, and the relationship between C in
   the silt + clay fraction and the percentage by weight of particles in
   this fraction was compared with similar data for soils from other
   regions and climates. Most of the cropping soils from Tasmania followed
   a previously published linear relationship, which is considered an
   indication of the capacity of soils to store C. The soils which fell the
   greatest distance below this relationship were sandy soils, consistent
   with previous evidence that these soils in Tasmania have been degraded.
   Soils which showed a major positive departure from the relationship were
   clay loams with > 60\% silt + clay. Most were also pasture soils.
   Tasmania's cool-temperate climate would promote plant growth and C
   inputs and slow C breakdown, while the high clay content would help
   protect C. The results for the clay loam soils are consistent with
   earlier observations that these soils are generally in good health.}},

Abstract = {{Soil functional stability is the capacity of soil functions to resist
   and recover from an environmental perturbation and can be used to
   evaluate soil health. It can be influenced by the presence of
   xenobiotics such as herbicides. The impact of a fresh 2,4-D
   contamination (36 mg kg(-1) dry soil) on soil functional stability was
   evaluated by comparing the capacity of soil enzyme activities to resist
   and recover from a heat perturbation for both a clean and
   2,4-D-contaminated soil. The functional stabilities of the soils
   (uniform sands, pH 6.9, 7\% (w/w) organic matter) were calculated using
   the relative soil stability index (RSSI). The RSSI scores indicate the
   proportion of potential enzyme activity the soil retains after a
   perturbation compared to the potential activity of an unperturbed soil.
   Six extra-cellular enzyme activities (acid and alkaline phosphatases,
   arylsulfatase, urease, protease and beta-glucosidase) were monitored in
   soil microcosms during a 15-day period. During this period, a 60 degrees
   C heat perturbation was applied to the soil for 24 h. The activities of
   arylsulfatase and protease were found to be the most stable following
   heat perturbation obtaining the highest RSSI scores (87\% and 77\%,
   respectively). Urease activity showed the lowest RSSI score (38\%).
   Although all enzyme activities were inhibited by the presence of 2,4-D,
   the RSSI results indicated that contamination lowered the stability of
   only three enzyme activities (arylsulfatase, P-glucosidase and urease).
   The RSSI adequately described resistance, recovery and recovery rate
   parameters and enabled differentiation between functional stabilities of
   clean and contaminated soil and between different soil types. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{In the application of biosolids on agricultural lands, 4-nonylphenol
   (4-NP) in soils is an important environmental concern because of its
   associated estrogenic risk to animals and human beings. Incubation
   experiments that involved the mixing of two contrasting soils (A:
   calcareous sandy soil; B: acidic clayey soil) and biosolids in 4-NP were
   performed to examine the effect of 4-NP on the rate of production of
   CO2, the mineralization of N and the microbial biomass, by considering
   the biodegradation of 4-NP for the evaluation of soil health. The
   experimental results indicated that the half-life (t(1/2)) of 4-NP
   increased with the supplementary concentration of 4-NP (80, 160 and 240
   mg kg(-1)) in the two soils, and the t(1/2) values in the soil A are
   always lower than that in soil B. The 4-NP supplement in the biosolids
   reverses C mineralization in soil B more than it does in soil A, but it
   reverses N mineralization in soil A more than in soil B. The aeration
   status and microbial population of the biosolids treated soils are key
   factors in determining the time course of 4-NP degradation associated
   with the microbial activities. The 4-NP was biodegraded mainly by
   bacteria, and the effect on C and N mineralization of 4-NP input is
   determined by a balance of the reductions in microbial biomass C (MBC)
   and N (MBN). After destruction in microbial cell membrane and protein
   structures by the 4-NP, C and N mineralization, MBC and MBN were
   subsequently followed by a final decline phase for the later period of
   incubation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   application with varied levels of recommended dose of fertilizer on
   yield and quality of `Kalipatti'sapota {[}Manilkarazapota (L.) P. Royan]
   and soil properties. The treatments were combinations of vermicompost
   (c) 2.5 tonnes/ha and 5 levels of recommended dose of fertilizer, i e
   100, 75, 50, 25 and 0\% of recommended dose of fertilizer. The pooled
   data revealed that highest fruit yield was recorded under 100\%
   recommended dose of fertilizer + vermicompost application (18.4 kg
   fruit/plant) that however remained on a par with 75\% recommended dose
   of fertilizer + vermicompost and 100\% recommended dose of fertilizer
   alone. Reduction in recommended dose of fertilizer beyond 75\% resulted
   in significantly lower yields. ne total soluble sugars remained
   significantly higher in all treatments involving vermicompost
   application. Application of vermicompost alone, however, resulted in
   significantly lower yield (46.7\% reduction over recommended dose of
   fertilizer + vermicompost application). Reduction in recommended dose of
   fertilizer levels resulted in lesser number of fruits (309, 294, 240 and
   203 fruits/plant under 100, 75, 50 and 25\% recommended dose of
   fertilizer application respectively). The fruit weight significantly
   reduced when the crop was fertilized fully inorganically (100 \%
   recommended dose of fertilizer) and also when less inorganic fertilizer
   was applied in conjunction with vermicompost (25\% recommended dose of
   fertilizer + vermicompost). Soil organic carbon increased but bulk
   density decreased due to vermicompost application.}},

Abstract = {{Despite being recognized as essential to soil health, soil fauna often
   are afforded inadequate protection. In this paper, we discuss
   interpretations of this problem from a traditional economic perspective.
   We argue that the traditional economic framework can provide adequate
   soil fauna protection if market failures are corrected, and in
   particular, all relevant costs and benefits to society are accounted
   for. In turn, we describe some of the techniques economists use to value
   changes in natural resource services and environmental quality that are
   not otherwise valued in markets. We identify some of the challenges in
   applying these methods, their limitations, and provide examples relevant
   to soil faunal services. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to identify the effect of different land
   uses in peri-urban agriculture on the soil properties. Soil health
   indicators were evaluated in the top 10 cm at five tilled agricultural
   sites involving different cropping systems and use of agrochemicals
   within the peri-urban agricultural areas of Yaounde, Cameroon, and
   compared with a native forest land. The experimental data showed that
   the selected indicators were sensitive to cropping practice. Most
   cropped land had significantly higher total C, available N and P
   concentrations, soil pH, electrical conductivity, salinity, biomass C
   and P, dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, and acid phosphatase activities.
   Land producing corn (Zea mays L.) and sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum
   L.) differed from that producing tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum
   Mill.), but cultivation of these crops has significantly impacted native
   soil quality. However, phenol oxidase, microbal biomass C/organic C
   (C(mic)/C(org)), and microbial biomass C/microbial biomass P
   (C(mic)/P(mic) were negatively affected. These appeared to be more
   consistent indicators of negative management causing changes to soil
   health and may be suitable for an early appraisal of soil health.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To study the impacts of abundance of woodlice, termites, and
   mites on some functional aspects of soil in order to elucidate the
   specific role of soil fauna in improving soil fertility in desert.
   Methods Fauna-rich sites were selected as experimental sites and
   adjacent areas were taken as control. Soil samples were collected from
   both sites. Soil respiration was measured at both sites. The soil
   samples were sent to laboratory, their chemical and biochemical
   properties were analyzed. Results Woodlice showed 25\% decrease in
   organic carbon and organic matter as compared to control site. Whereas
   termites and mites showed 58\% and 16\% decrease in organic carbon and
   organic matter. In contrast, available nitrogen (nitrate and ammonical
   both) and phosphorus exhibited 2-fold and 1.2-fold increase,
   respectively. Soil respiration and dehydrogenase activity at the sites
   rich in woodlice, termites and mites produced 2.5-, 3.5- and 2-fold
   increases, respectively as compared to their control values.
   Fauna-associated increase in these biological parameters clearly
   reflected fauna-induced microbial activity in soil. Maximum decrease in
   organic carbon and increase in nitrate-nitrogen and ammonical-nitrogen,
   available phosphorus, soil respiration and dehydrogenase activity were
   produced by termites and minimum by mites reflecting termite as an
   efficient soil improver in desert environment. Conclusion The soil
   fauna-associated changes in chemical (organic carbon, nitrate-nitrogen,
   ammonical-nitrogen, phosphorus) and biochemical (soil respiration,
   dehydrogenase activity) properties of soil improve soil health and help
   in conservation of desert pedoecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Not only the nutritional status and biological activity but also the
   soil ecological functioning or soil health has been impacted profoundly
   by land degradation in the karst area of southwest China where the karst
   ecosystems are generally considered as extremely vulnerable to land
   degradation under intensified land-use changes. The objectives of this
   study are to elucidate the changes in overall soil quality by a holistic
   approach of soil nutritional, biological activity, and soil health
   indicators in the karst area as impacted by intense cultivation and
   vegetation degradation. Topsoil samples were collected on selected
   eco-tesserae in a sequence of land degradation in a karst area of
   southwest Guizhou in 2004. The soil nutrient pools of organic carbon
   (C-org), extractable extracellular carbon (C-ext), total soil nitrogen
   (N-t), alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen (N-ah), total phosphorus (P-t),
   available phosphorus (P-a) were analyzed by wet soil chemistry. The soil
   biological properties were studied by means of measurements of microbial
   biomass carbon (both by fumigation-extraction, FE-C-mic, and by
   calculation from substrate-incubation respiration, SIR-C-mic) of
   respiration {[}respiration without addition of substrates, basal
   respiration (BR), and potential respiration (PR) with
   substrate-incubation] and of soil enzyme activities (invertase, urease,
   and alkaline phosphatase). Soil health status was assessed by simple
   indices of C-mic/C-org and BR/C-mic in conjunction with bacterial
   community structures determined by polymerase chain reaction and
   denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. While the nutritional pool
   parameters, such as C-org and C-ext, described basically the changes in
   soil life-supporting capacity with cultivation interference and
   vegetation declined, those parameters of biological activity such as
   FE-C-mic, SIR, and SIR-C-mic as well as bacterial community structures
   measured by molecular method evidenced well the changes in soil
   functioning for ecosystem health with the land degradation.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of canopy, soil physico-chemical and microbiological
   variables on Sclerotinia, stem rot (SSR) on soybean were assessed in two
   soils (clay loam and sandy loam) using multiple regression and canonical
   redundancy analysis (RDA) and their partial form to control for the
   rotation (2 or 3-y-corn/soybean monoculture) and fertilization
   (mineral/urban compost) or spatial variables effects. The models
   revealed the minimal sets of variables that best explain the variance of
   the survival of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum's sclerotia, carpogenic
   germination, disease severity and their associations. In clay loam, the
   3-y-corn rotation reduced disease severity mainly through the reduction
   of weed biomass that favoured carpogenic germination. Urban compost has
   a conducive effect explained by a better soil surface drainage.
   Additionally, total N was found suppressive to sclerotial survival. In
   sandy loam, the carpogenic germination was negatively correlated with
   high C mineralization quotient and aggregate stability but correlated
   positively with Ca. Sclerotial survival was negatively correlated with
   pH and Ca, and positively correlated with biological fertility index.
   Aggregate stability, Ca and pH were associated with the urban compost.
   The regression and RDA analyses allowed to identify key variables that
   drived SSR development and explain their relationship with the cultural
   practices, soil health, as well as the spatial variation of disease
   variables. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Frequently, agriculture intensification by means of high-input
   technologies and agroecosystem simplification led to unsustainable
   farming systems. Increasing spatial-temporal diversity in agroecosystems
   has been shown as a promising alternative for restoring degraded land. A
   methodological approach is discussed here, based on preliminary results
   of experiences in a region of strong biophysical gradients. The CENTURY
   model is validated under local conditions and used as monitoring tool.
   The impact of an increased agrodiversity on soils with contrasting
   inherent properties is exemplified by running three land use scenarios
   for two case-study sites for the next 50 years and evaluating trends in
   soil organic matter (SOM) contents. Field survey and simulation results
   suggested that: (1) reference values for SOM levels for monitoring soil
   health should be defined considering main agroecological factors; (2)
   simulation models may help identifying adequate ranges of variation for
   them; (3) and model outputs may complement experimentation and represent
   a didactic tool to be used for decision-making and knowledge-transfer
   processes.}},

   marked inhibition on soil microorganisms was observed after the second
   pesticide addition. However, after initial variations, soil bacteria,
   fungi, and actinomycetes adapted gradually to chlorothalonil, and the
   negative effects became transient and weaker following the third and
   fourth treatments. The inhibitory effect of repeated chlorothalonil
   applications on soil enzymes followed a similar trend to that on soil
   microorganisms. Repeated chlorothalonil applications did not result in
   significant changes in its persistence. Three bacterial strains capable
   of utilizing chlorothalonil as a sole source of carbon and energy for
   growth were isolated 21 days after the fourth treatment with
   chlorothalonil, which indicated that the capability of soil
   microorganisms for degrading chlorothalonil was formed during the
   experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Largely accessible organic wastes can be turned into valuable compost
   product for raising crops organically on one hand, and get them disposed
   off safely at the other end. Straight use of organic wastes has
   tribulations like transportation and handling, wider C:N ratio, high
   application rates, nutrient overloading, weed seeds, pathogens, and
   metal toxicities. Composting bestows a tactic for coping high volumes of
   organic wastes in environmentally sound and desirable manners. Composted
   materials are remarkably regarded for their ability to improve soil
   health and plant growth, and suppress pathogens and plant diseases.
   Currently several composting systems have become available; ranging from
   a crude and slow windrows method, to the most speedy and computer
   monitored in-vessel system. Scientific investigations of this biological
   cum chemical process have reached to molecular level. Value addition of
   compost through beneficial microorganisms, mineral materials and
   fertilisers is also being considered. The nature and composition of
   materials put into composting is imperative for its quality rationale.
   On the whole, principles and processes governing composting are not so
   straightforward that ordinary enterprises could develop efficient
   composting facilities for the treatment of organic wastes. In this
   scenario, accessibility of comprehensive information to the scientific
   community as well as environmental protection agencies is imperative.
   This review article brings together the current information necessary
   for effective composting of organic wastes from different origins with
   diversified characteristics under various situations. It also covers the
   schematic description of well known composting systems, and various
   factors controlling the process.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring is an essential part of an environmental management system
   (EMS) if landholders are to demonstrate improved environmental
   performance. This paper reports results of two surveys to determine
   environmental issues and priorities for monitoring. The first survey was
   conducted on 12 EMS pilot projects, and the second on 18 catchment
   management organisations in Australia. With the exception of pastoral
   zones, EMS facilitators identified moderate to major issues in land
   condition, water balance, riparian zone, native vegetation condition and
   pests. Water quality issues were rated as minor to moderate problems.
   Issues raised by the greatest number of respondents were water balance
   problems and weed and pest issues. Catchment managers reported
   widespread degradation issues in land condition, water balance problems,
   altered water flow, water quantity and availability and water quality.
   Degradation of the riparian zone and native vegetation were also
   reported. Both EMS facilitators and catchment management organisations
   understood the need for environmental monitoring; however, few EMS pilot
   projects have addressed it. This was due, in part, to a lack of readily
   available tools and concentration on the EMS process itself. Tools of
   most interest to facilitators were soil erosion risk, soil test
   interpretation, soil structure assessment, soil health, water leakage
   and perenniality, water quality, riparian zone management, herbicide
   resistance, greenhouse emissions and energy use. Facilitators also
   suggested that tools should be delivered in several formats, but
   workshops delivered by experts were of most interest. Catchment managers
   had realistic and pragmatic views about the role of landholder
   monitoring in assessing catchment outcomes and there is a mismatch
   between landholder monitoring and catchment reporting requirements.
   Landholders are likely to monitor only what is in their direct interests
   and this will be mainly on land condition. We conclude that on-farm
   environmental monitoring conducted by landholders will be of limited use
   for catchment management organisation reporting. However, it will be
   very important in helping farmers to make more informed decisions about
   their environmental management, together with education and support. The
   issue of catchment condition monitoring and reporting requires serious
   attention as current monitoring and reporting is likely to be
   inadequate.}},

Abstract = {{Soil erosion and desertification are the physical expressions of land
   degradation, while the social and economic impacts are degraded
   lifestyles and pernicious poverty. An understanding of how to maintain
   healthy soil is essential to reverse and prevent land degradation.
   Organic agriculture is a whole system approach based upon a set of
   processes resulting in sustainable ecosystems, safe food, good
   nutrition, animal welfare and social justice. It is more than just a
   system of production that includes or excludes certain inputs,
   particularly agro-chemicals, because it builds on and enhances the
   ecological management skills of farmers, fisher folk and pastoralists.
   Practicing organic or agro-ecological agriculture requires ecological
   knowledge, planning and commitment to work with natural systems, rather
   than trying to change them.
   IFOAM (International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements) is an
   organization that promotes such sustainable agricultural systems. The
   application and upholding of the principles of organic agriculture can
   help ensure that agriculture can be continued throughout the world while
   contributing to the prevention and reversal of land degradation,
   combating poverty and building a fairer world order for all people. In
   2004, IFOAM published a scoping study on ``The Role of Organic
   Agriculture in Mitigating Climate Change{''}. The study looked at how
   organic agriculture could contribute to reducing green house gas (GHG)
   emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
   Organic agriculture minimizes carbon dioxide emissions from agricultural
   ecosystems, and can also contribute to carbon sequestration because of
   the systematic application of manure and compost from animal and crop
   residues, crop-legume rotations, green manuring with legumes, and
   agroforestry with multipurpose leguminous trees. Soil is the most
   important sink for methane where high bacterial activity oxidizes it.
   Controlled anaerobic digestion of animal manure can contribute
   significantly to reducing methane emissions. Nitrous oxide emissions are
   minimized in an organic system.
   In 1996, the Institute for Sustainable Development started to work with
   local farming communities and local development agents and experts in
   Tigray, northern Ethiopia, to rehabilitate their environment and raise
   crop yields through using compost. Since 1998, ISD has monitored the
   impact of compost on crop yields in farmers' fields. Overall, compost
   generally doubles the yield from fields that have not had any input. In
   most cases it also gives a higher yield than the use of chemical
   fertilizer. Other benefits from using compost include increased moisture
   retention capacity of the soil and reduced crop pest problems.
   The principles behind organic agriculture are also used in programs and
   projects focused on overcoming food insecurity, rural poverty and
   environmental degradation. In 2003, IFOAM reported that over 40,000
   farms covering 235,000 ha of land were growing certified organic
   products in Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Fabricated soil (FS) is usually used for landscape rehabilitation, and
   is an excellent example of environmental remediation. These soils were
   used to revitalise damaged and eroded soils caused by acid mine
   drainage, a common site in Western Pennsylvania. The ratio of bacterial
   and fungal microbiota contributes to the health, fertility and
   sustainability of the soil. The structure and function of the soils
   foodweb have been suggested for numerous times as a prime indicator of
   ecosystem health (Bongers, 1990; Coleman et al., 1992; Kalevitch et al.,
   2003). The measurement of disrupted soil processes, decreased bacterial
   or fungal activity or decreased fungal or bacterial biomass can indicate
   a problem long before the natural vegetation is lost (Bongers, 1990).
   After the exposure of FS to the natural habitat, we evaluated the
   bacterial and fungal activity in soil as this is an important indicator
   of soil health. Details on bacterial presence and specifics in
   application of FS are described in previous publications (Kalevitch et
   al., 2003, 2004a, 2004b). In this paper, we will concentrate on the role
   of fungal biomass in FS.}},

Title = {{Green manuring in crop production}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4-6}},
Pages = {{691-719}},
Abstract = {{The positive role of green manuring in crop production has been known
   since ancient time. Importance of this soil ameliorating practice is
   increasing in recent years because of high cost of chemical fertilizers,
   increased risk of environmental pollution, and need of sustainable
   cropping systems. Green manuring can improve soil physical, chemical,
   and biological properties and consequently crop yields. Furthermore,
   potential benefits of green manuring are reduced nitrate (NO3-) leaching
   risk and lower fertilizer N requirements for succeeding crops. However,
   its influence may vary from soil to soil, crop to crop, environmental
   variables, type of green manure crop used, and its management.
   Beneficial effects of green manuring in crop production should not be
   evaluated in isolation; however, in integration with chemical
   fertilizers. The objective of this article is to review recent advances
   in green manuring practice, in the context of potential benefits and
   drawbacks in use of this practice for annual crop production and sustain
   soil health and fertility.}},

Abstract = {{This work is a `historical' revision of the evolution of an experimental
   procedure developed by Prof. Lisardo Nunez and his research group
   TERBIPROMAT to study the sustainability and the soil health state.
   From the very beginning, in 1993, the microbial activity was the main
   bioindicator selected to analyse the `soil health state'. For this
   reason, a microcalorimetric technique was used lately to analyse the
   influence of different human activities such as reforestations,
   agricultural exploitation or pollution on the microbial activity in
   different soils. Microcalorimetry is the main scientific technique used
   in this research to follow the stimulation of the microbial activity by
   addition of glucose. The data obtained were complemented by a study of
   physical, chemical and biological parameters of soil and allowed to
   follow the microbial activity in soils of Galicia (Spain) along the
   year.
   The final results, still in revision, will be helpful in establishing a
   data basis for real maps of the `health state' of different soils. Such
   maps could be used to design processes that help us to decide how we
   should exploit soils ensuring their sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Human health risk assessment of sites contaminated by volatile
   hydrocarbons involves site-specific evaluations of soil or groundwater
   contaminants and development of Australian soil health-based
   investigation levels (HILs). Exposure assessment of vapors arising from
   subsurface sources includes the use of overseas-derived commercial
   models to predict indoor air concentrations. These indoor vapor
   intrusion models commonly consider steady-state assumptions, infinite
   sources, limited soil biodegradation, negligible free phase, and
   equilibrium partitioning into air and water phases to represent
   advective and diffusive processes. Regional model construct influences
   and input parameters affect model predictions while steady-state
   assumptions introduce conservatism and jointly highlight the need for
   Australian-specific indoor vapor intrusion assessment. An Australian
   non-steady-state indoor vapor intrusion model has been developed to
   determine cumulative indoor human doses (CIHDs) and to address these
   concerns by incorporating Australian experimental field data to consider
   mixing, dilution, ventilation, sink effects and first-order soil and air
   degradation. It was used to develop provisional HILs for benzene,
   toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX), naphthalene, and volatile
   aliphatic and aromatic total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) <= EC16
   fractions for crawl space dwellings. This article summarizes current
   state of knowledge and discusses proposed research for differing
   exposure scenarios based on Australian dwelling and subsurface
   influences, concurrent with sensitivity analyses of input parameters and
   in-field model validation.}},

Abstract = {{The present studies were undertaken to develop an effective package of
   organic farming for cowpea crop. Five treatment combinations resulting
   from three organic sources i.e. T-1- farmyard manure + biofertilizers,
   T-2- poultry manure + biofertilizers, T-3-vermicompost + biofertilizers,
   T-4- combination of farmyard manure, poultry manure, vermicompost along
   with biofertilizers and T-5- recommended dose of chemical fertilizers
   were tested. The results revealed that farmyard manure + biofertillizers
   gave 9.7\% higher green pod yield than the treatment having recommended
   dose of chemical fertilizers but at par with T-2 (poultry manure +
   biofertilizers) and T-4 (combination of farmyard manure, poultry manure,
   vermicompost along with biofertilizers). The organically produced cowpea
   fruits possessed long shelf life at room storage. Maximum uptake of
   nutrients was obtained from the treatment having the combination of
   farmyard manure, poultry manure and vermi-compost along with
   biofertilizers as well as all the organic manures improved the soil
   health.}},

Abstract = {{Soil is a component of primary importance in crop production, even if it
   is often neglected, or only regarded as a physical support for the
   growth of plants. However, with the increasing societal concerns for the
   sustainability of agriculture, soil must be considered as a living
   system. Its quality results from the multiple interactions among
   physicochemical and biological components, notably the microbial
   communities, primordial for soil function. Crops are threatened by
   soil-borne diseases. These are often difficult to control, because of
   the ``hidden{''} status of the pathogens and also because of the
   absence, noxiousness or lack of efficacy of chemical treatments. In this
   context, there is a renewed interest for cultural practices such as the
   use of organic amendments. These practices have a strong influence on
   soil health, which takes into account plant health, through both changes
   of physicochemical characteristics and influence on soil microbial
   communities. Cultural practices are used to improve soil health, and
   can, in some cases, increase soil disease suppression. The effects of
   these practices on soil properties have been studied, but the
   relationship between these properties and soil suppressiveness has not
   been always very clear. Many different soil descriptors, either abiotic
   or biotic, have been used to describe the soil health and
   suppressiveness, but there is a lack of identified, reliable and
   consistent indicators.
   One aim of this review is to show that, despite the age of the soil
   health concept and all the studies that have been conducted, there are
   still no guidelines for assessment of soil quality from the plant health
   point of view. Obviously, the extreme diversity of situations makes any
   generalisation from a given case-study difficult. However, based on what
   has already been done in related fields, a methodology to search for
   indicators of soil health can be proposed.
   In this review we will present (i) how a healthy soil can be defined and
   what are the concepts hidden behind the words ``soil health,{''} (ii)
   which cultural practices have been used to control soil-borne diseases
   and their limitations, (iii) which soil parameters have been measured
   when studying soil suppressiveness, and which relationships have been
   found between these parameters, and finally (iv) how these descriptors
   could become indicators of soil health, using appropriate analytical and
   statistical methods. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of alkaline dust pollution emitted from Bartin cement plant
   on the soil microbial biomass carbon was investigated using the
   chloroform fumigation-extraction (CFE) method. Microbial biomass C
   (C(mic)) values ranged from 157.82 to 1201.51 mu g g(-1) soils in the
   polluted area and from 726.70 to 1529.14 mu g g(-1) soils in the control
   area. Soils polluted with alkaline cement dust resulted in significant
   reductions in C(mic) levels compared to control soils. Microbial biomass
   C correlated negatively with CaCO(3) content (r = -0.52, P < 0.05) and
   positively with soil organic C (r = 0.67, P < 0.01). C(mic):C(org) ratio
   proved to be a reliable soil microbial parameter for describing the
   change in the man-made ecosystem. Mean C(mic):C(org) ratio was 2.55 and
   3.09 in the polluted soils and control soils, respectively. The decrease
   in this ratio was an indication of soil degradation in the polluted
   soils. A significant decline in the C(mic):C(org) ratio in cement
   dust-polluted soils also indicated that this parameter can serve as a
   good indicator of soil health.}},

Abstract = {{The invertebrate springtail species Paronychiurus kimi (Lee) was
   selected for use in toxicity testing because it is more ecologically
   relevant to Korean soils than Folsomia candida Willem, which is the
   standard animal for toxicity tests. Responses of P. kimi to cadmium,
   mercury and lead were evaluated in artificial soils following the
   standardized ISO protocol. Although, reproduction of P. kimi was not as
   high as that of F candida, 30 adults produced at least 200 juveniles
   over 28 days. For each of the three heavy metals, LC(50) and EC(50) for
   reproduction and NOEC and LOEC for the effect on reproduction and
   instantaneous rate of population increase (r(i)) were also estimated.
   The 7 days LC(50) was 532, 3.9 and 1322 mg/kg dry soil for cadmium,
   mercury and lead, respectively. As exposure time increased from 7 to 28
   days, the LC(50) values decreased for cadmium but not or only slightly
   for mercury and lead. The 28 days EC(50) was 60.0 for cadmium, 0.23 for
   mercury and 428 mg/kg for lead. Significant changes in r(i) of R kimi
   were closely followed by the changes in the sublethal endpoint measured
   (reproduction) and populations were heading toward extinction (r(i) = 0)
   at concentration of 129, 2.0 and 1312 mg/kg dry soil for cadmium,
   mercury and lead, respectively. P kimi was found to be more sensitive to
   all heavy metals tested than F candida, confirming its suitability as a
   bioindicator species for soil toxicological testing in Korea. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Slate quarrying in Mahendragarh district of Haryana state has resulted
   in changes in soil properties. Most of the mining area is devoid of
   vegetation. The soil in and around the mining area (0-1 km) is alkaline
   (pH 11.2-11.7) but non-saline (electrical conductivity < 4). The
   alkaline nature of the soil was attributed to the high concentrations of
   hydroxyl (OH-), carbonate (CO32-) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) present in
   minerals of mined materials. Biotite, limonite, kaolinite, gibbsite,
   muscovite, geothite, dolomite and so on were the chief minerals added to
   soil through mining. The physical properties of soil, i.e. porosity,
   water-holding capacity (WHC), bulk density and particle density
   represented poor soil health in mining area (34.4, 29.8\%, 1.636, 2.496
   g/cc, respectively) and they improved with distance away from it (46.4,
   38.3\%, 1.070, 2.180 g/cc, respectively, at a distance of 1 km).
   Porosity and WHC were found to be a function of increased organic matter
   away from the mining area. CO32-, HCO3-, phosphate (PO43-), lead (Pb)
   and iron (Fe) were more in mining area and decreased with distance. On
   the other hand, sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), sulphate
   (SO42-), organic carbon, total Kjeldahl's nitrogen, cation exchange
   capacity, chromium (Cr) and cadmium (Cd) increased with distance from
   mining area. High concentration of heavy metals in mining area was a
   cause of concern (0.93 mu g/g Cd, 22.35 mu g/g Cr, 26.25 mu g/g Pb,
   1,383.75 mu g/g Fe). The change in physico-chemical properties could be
   because of the addition of chemical constituents that are a part of
   major minerals present in mined material. The soil away from mining area
   represented comparatively better properties.}},

Abstract = {{Permanent raised beds are being proposed for the rice-wheat system in
   the Indo-Gangetic Plain to increase its productivity and to save water.
   It is not clear whether reported water savings in rice arise front the
   geometry of the beds per se or from the particular water management that
   keeps the soil in aerobic conditions and that can also be applied on
   flat land. Moreover, little research has been reported on direct seeding
   of rice on raised beds and on the effect of raised beds on the
   Subsequent wheat crop. In this paper we compare the yield, input water
   (rainfall and irrigation) use and water productivity of dry-seeded rice
   on raised beds and flat land with that of flooded transplanted and
   wet-seeded rice, and analyze the effects of beds on the subsequent wheat
   crop. The experiment was conducted in 2001-2003 at New Delhi, India.
   Rice yields on raised beds that were kept around field capacity were
   32-42\% lower than under flooded transplanted conditions and 21\% lower
   than under flooded wet-seeded conditions. Water inputs were reduced by
   32-42\% compared with flooded rice, but could also be accomplished with
   dry seeding on flat land with the same water management. Reduced water
   inputs and yield reductions balanced each other so that water
   productivity was comparable among most treatments. Wheat yield was
   12-17\% lower on raised beds than on flat land with conventional (20 cm)
   row spacing. Neither wheat nor rice on raised beds compensated for the
   loss in rows by extra tillering or leaf growth at the edges of the rows.
   There was no carry-over effect of type of land preparation in rice on
   the growth and yield of the subsequent wheat crop. Further research on
   raised beds should focus on the selection of suitable rice and wheat
   varieties, soil health issues Such as nematodes and micro-nutrient
   deficiencies, weed control, bed stability and long-term carry-over
   effects front one crop to the other. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of the dynamics of carbon (C) stock in soils, as
   impacted by management strategies, is necessary to identify the pathways
   of C sequestration in soils and for maintaining soil organic C (SOC) at
   a level critical for upkeeping soil health and also for restraining
   global warming. This is more important in tropical and subtropical
   region where soils are inherently low in organic C content and the
   production system is fragile. We evaluated the long-term role of crop
   residue C inputs to soil in SOC sequestration and also the critical
   value of C inputs for maintenance of SOC across five different
   rice-based cropping systems and four soil management practices including
   a fallow (no cultivation since initiation of the experiments) using five
   long-term (7-36 years) fertility experiments in subtropical India.
   Cropping per se always caused a net depletion of SOC. Such depletion was
   inversely proportional to the amount of crop residue C incorporated into
   the soils (r=-0.92, P=0.001). Balanced fertilization with NPK, however,
   caused an enrichment (9.3-51.8\% over the control) of SOC, its extent
   being influenced by the cropping systems. Long-term application of
   organic amendments (5-10 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) through farmyard manure (FYM)
   or compost could increase SOC hardly by 10.7\% constituting only 18\% of
   the applied C, the rest getting lost through oxidation. The total
   quantity of soil C sequestered varied from -11.5 to 14.5 Mg C ha(-1) and
   was linearly related (r(2)=0.40, P=0.005) with cumulative crop residue C
   inputs to the soils. On an average, the rate of its conversion to SOC
   came out to be 6.4\%. This was more in presence of added organics
   (6.9\%) than in its absence (4.2\%). For sustenance of SOC level (zero
   change due to cropping) we found that a minimum quantity of 2.9 Mg C is
   required to be added per hectare per annum as inputs. The cropping
   systems and the management practices that could provide C input higher
   than the above critical level are likely to sustain the SOC level and
   maintain good soil health in the subtropical regions of the Indian
   subcontinent.}},

Abstract = {{Soil compaction in agriculture induced by large-scale equipment is of
   growing concern. Heavy wheel loads used in arable cropping have the
   potential to cause irreversible damage to the subsoil structure and may
   lead to harmful soil compaction. In order to sustain or improve soil
   health or fitness on a sustainable basis, indicators are needed to
   assess the changes in the soil structure and the respective soil
   functions. This requires an adequate verification of methods for
   distinguishing between the impairment of soil structure and the
   disruption of soil functions, and for the respective subject of
   protection.
   In this article the link between existing models of soil physical
   prognosis, practical guidelines, and criteria for the identification of
   affected soil structure is demonstrated, and a viable concept to
   distinguish harmful changes to the soil is presented. The concept
   consists of methods for soil physical analysis such as ``pre-compression
   stress{''} and ``loading ratio{''}, practical recommendations for best
   management practice, and an indicator-based model for the identification
   of harmful subsoil compaction derived from a research project for the
   German Federal Environmental Agency, making it possible to determine for
   a respective location the required level of action far beyond the common
   practice of precautions against harmful soil compaction. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Electrokinetic techniques have been used to stimulate the removal of
   organic pollutants within soil, by directing contaminant migration to
   where remediation may be more easily achieved. The effect of this and
   other physical remediation techniques on the health of soil microbial
   communities has been poorly studied and indeed, largely ignored. This
   study reports the impact on soil microbial communities during the
   application of an electric field within ex situ laboratory soil
   microcosms contaminated with pentachlorophenol (PCP; 100 mg kg(-1) oven
   dry soil). Electrokinetics reduced counts of culturable bacteria and
   fungi, soil microbial respiration and carbon substrate utilisation,
   especially close to the acidic anode where PCP accumulated (36 d),
   perhaps exacerbated by the greater toxicity of PCP at lower soil pH.
   There is little doubt that a better awareness of the interactions
   between soil electrokinetic processes and microbial communities is key
   to improving the efficacy and sustainability of this remediation
   strategy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Food and fodder shortage in and and semi-arid regions force farmers to
   use marginal quality water for meeting the water requirement of crops
   which result in low quality, reduced production and an adverse impact on
   soil properties. A field study on loamy-sand (Hyperthermic Typic
   Ustipsamments) saline soil was conducted during 1999-2001 at Central
   Institute for Research on Buffaloes, Hisar. This involved assessment of
   effects of conjunctive use of saline water, EC = 4.6-7.4dSm(-1), SAR =
   14-22 (mmol(-1))(1/2) with good quality water on five fodder crop
   rotations: oat-sorghum (Avena sativa-Sorghum bicolor), rye grass-sorghum
   (Loleum rigidum-Sorghum bicolor), Egyptian clover-sorghum (Trifoleum
   alexandrinum-Sorghum bicolor), Persian clover-sorghum (Trifoleum
   resupinatum-Sorghum bicolor) and Indian clover-sorghum (Melilotus
   indica-Sorghum bicolor) and certain soil properties associated with it.
   Leguminous winter fodder crops were more sensitive to poor quality water
   use. Reductions in fodder yield with use of saline water alone
   throughout season were 85, 68, 54, 42, 36 and 26 per cent in Indian
   clover, Egyptian clover, Persian clover, oat, rye grass and sorghum
   respectively as compared to good quality water. Leguminous fodder crops
   produced protein rich (12-14 per cent) and low fibre (18-20 per cent)
   fodder as compared to poor quality grassy fodder under good quality
   water irrigation but their quality deteriorated when saline water was
   used. These leguminous crops accumulated proportionately higher Na+
   (1.58 percent) resulting in adverse impact on their growth as compared
   to grassy fodder crops. Higher soil salinity (12.2 dSm(-1)), SAR = 20
   (mmol(-1))(1/2) was recorded with saline water irrigation; and slight
   adverse impact was noticed on infiltration rate and contents of water
   dispersible clay. Alternate cyclic use of canal and saline water could
   be an option for fodder production under such conditions. Copyright (c)

   decrease in the salinity parameters measured (electrical conductivity,
   pH, and sodium adsorption ratio), with a gradual increase in rice and
   wheat grain yields. It was observed that the disc plow, which not only
   ensured favorable yields but also helped improve soil health at all the
   three sites, was the most effective tillage implement. Also, application
   of sulfuric acid resulted in higher yields and promoted rapid
   amelioration of the saline-sodic soils.}},

Abstract = {{The maintenance of soil health and productivity is a central aim of
   sustainable agriculture. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are soil
   biota fundamental for soil fertility and plant nutrition, which may be
   used in the evaluation of the impact of agronomic practices on soil
   quality. In the present study we evaluated the influence of three
   different land uses on AMF populations and correlated glomalin-related
   soil protein (GRSP) content with AMF biomass parameters, such as spore
   density and biovolume. Among the differently managed sites-maize
   monoculture, grassland and poplar grove-maize soil showed the lowest AMF
   spore number and GRSP content. The same morphological taxa were found in
   the three sites, except for one additional morphotype in poplar grove. A
   good correlation between GRSP and spore biovolume was found, suggesting
   that GRSP may represent a useful biochemical parameter for the
   assessment of biological soil fertility in sustainable agriculture. (c)

Abstract = {{There is a great need to understand the environmental impacts of organic
   pollutants on soil health. Phthalates are widely used in consumables and
   can be found extensively. We studied the toxicity of diethyl phthalate
   (DEP), spiked in a compost plant growth substrate, by means of the acute
   toxicity Flash test and on the basis of the germination and plant growth
   of radish seedlings. The response of the microbial community to DEP in
   the growth substrate was studied by PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis). In the acute toxicity test, DEP was found to be less
   toxic as a pure compound than when mixed with the compost mixture. This
   suggests the synergistic effect of unknown toxic compounds or the
   release of compounds due to DEP addition. The same DEP concentration
   level in compost substrate induced toxic response in both plant test and
   microbial community analysis. The diversity of the major microbial
   community was reduced from a broad community to only 10 major species at
   toxic concentrations of DEP. Several of the identified microbial species
   are known to be able to degrade phthalates, which means that the
   suppression of other microbial species might be due to the substrate
   availability and toxicity. The major species identified included
   Sphingomonas sp., Pseudomonas sp., Actinomycetes sp. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {{With the renewed interest. in the use of coal fly-ash for amendment of
   agricultural soils in Australia, we assessed how earthworms, as
   indicators of soil health, responded to this ameliorant. We assessed
   survival, weight, burrowing and elemental concentrations for earthworms
   of a native unnamed Megascolecid species and of exotic Aporrectodea
   trapezoides in intact soil cores treated with an alkaline fly-ash at
   rates equivalent to 0, 5 and 25 t/ha over 6 weeks. Fly-ash did not
   affect survival, growth, number of burrows created or phosphorus
   solubilisation. Transfer of the earthworms to the new environment having
   vastly different pH from where they were collected, and possibly
   overcrowding, caused mortality in the soil cores for all treatments. A.
   trapezoides that had smaller individuals suffered mortality of 12\%
   compared with 23\% for the larger earthworms of Megascolecids.
   Earthworms of Megascolecids each increased their weight by 0.24g (25\%
   of their original weight) while those of A. trapezoides lost 0.18g each
   (21\% of their original weight). The difference in growth between the
   two earthworms was associated with grazing habit and probably with the
   large difference in the pH between source soil and that of the core
   soil. Megascolecids appeared to minimize grazing on ash-tainted soil and
   so ingested less Zn, which was more abundant in the fly-ash than in the
   soil, compared with A. trapezoides that had elevated concentration of
   this metal. Extractable P in the soil was increased with both species of
   earthworms, more so with the exotic species that solubilized 11\% more P
   than the native Megascolecids. The benign influence of fly-ash on
   survival and growth of worms was associated with the pH of soil
   remaining unchanged during the six weeks of incubation. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Organic farming is becoming a major tool for sustaining the soil quality
   degraded by intensive use of synthetic chemicals for increasing crop
   production and therefore, use of bio-agents as biofertilizers or
   biopesticides is an integral part of organic farming especially in
   vegetable cultivation. An effort was, therefore, made to see the effect
   of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and pseudomonads as the microbial
   inoculants in vegetable based cropping systems under organic farming
   practices. Three crops taken in rotation were okra, pea and cowpea in a
   year. The inoculants used were Glomus intraradices, an arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungus, and four isolates of Pseudomonas fluorescens singly
   and in combinations. No chemical/organic fertilizer was added during two
   rotations of chosen vegetables except the crop residues, which was
   chopped and distributed equally onto the each plot after the harvest of
   the fruits. A significant increase in yield was observed in the
   inoculated plots over the control. Culturable microbial diversity was
   increased compared with the start of the experiment. Total microbial
   diversity as assessed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis
   confirmed the results of culturable total and functional diversity
   analysed using Shannon Weaver's diversity indices (H'). Functional
   diversity assessed in terms of cellulase, xylanase, amylase, protease
   producers and P-solubilizers showed that the inoculants worked
   beneficially for maintaining soil health. The mycorrhizal inoculation
   followed by combination of AMF and pseudomonads proved to be better.
   Present findings indicated that microbial gene pool especially the key
   helpers for the maintenance of soil health residing in the vicinity of
   roots, was positively affected by using pseudomonads and AMF. Under
   organic farming management practices, inoculated bicagents and crop
   residues increased the yield of vegetables. (c) 2007 Published by

Abstract = {{Climate change has emerged as the most prominent of the global
   environment issues and there is a need to evaluate its impact on
   agriculture. Crop simulation models help greatly in this regard. Crop
   models such as WTGROWS, INFOCROP, ORYZA and DSSAT have been widely used
   for land use planning, agri-production estimates, impact of climate
   change and environmental impact analysis. Vulnerable regions under
   future scenarios of climate change and adaptation strategies (agronomic
   and input management) have been evolved for many important crops by
   using simulation techniques. One of the simple empirical techniques for
   evaluating the impact of future climate change is through historic
   analysis of the response of crops to inter-seasonal climatic
   variability. The impact of temperature rise is different for crops grown
   under variable production environments. Interactions exist for changes
   in temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, solar radiation and
   rainfall on growth and yield of crops. Adaptation strategies through the
   adoption of agronomic management options (such as altered date of
   sowing, scheduling of water and nutrients) can sustain agricultural
   productivity under climate change. The rapid changes in land use and
   land cover have to be included for impact analysis. Linking of the
   socioeconomic aspects needs to be strengthened.}},

   soil. It was also found effective in minimizing the alkalinity of soil
   compared to other treatments as indicated by pH change. However
   incorporation of paddy straw in conjunction with N60P60 and T. reesei
   inoculation resulted in maximum dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase and
   highest humus content of soil. Mixed inoculation of A. awamori and T.
   reesei did not prove effective in improving the soil biochemical
   properties in comparison to single inoculation of T. reesei. Results
   showed that in situ incorporation of paddy straw in combination with

Title = {{Ecotoxicological assessment of the effects of glyphosate and
   chlorpyrifos in an Argentine soya field}},

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Background, Aim and Scope. Continuous application of pesticides may
   pollute soils and affect non-target organisms. Soil is a complex
   ecosystem; its components can modulate the effects of pesticides.
   Therefore, it is recommended to evaluate the potential environmental
   risk of these compounds in local conditions. We performed an integrated
   field-laboratory study on an Argentine soya field sprayed with
   glyphosate and chlorpyrifos under controlled conditions. Our aim was to
   compare the sensitivity of a series of endpoints for the assessment of
   adverse effects of the extensive use of these agrochemicals.
   Materials and Methods. A RR soya field in a traditional farming area of
   Argentina was sprayed with glyphosate (GLY) or chlorpyrifos (CPF)
   formulations at the commercially recommended rates, according to a
   randomized complete block design with 3 replicates. In laboratory
   assays, Eisenia fetida andrei were exposed to soil samples (0-10 cm
   depth) collected between the rows of soya. Endpoints linked to behavior
   and biological activity (reproduction, avoidance behavior and
   bait-lamina tests) and cellular/subcellular assays (Neutral Red
   Retention Time NRRT; DNA damage - Comet assay) were tested. Field assays
   included litterbag and bait-lamina tests. Physico/chemical analyses were
   performed on soil samples.
   Results. GLY reduced cocoon viability, decreasing the number of
   juveniles. Moreover, earthworms avoided soils treated with GLY. No
   effects on either reproduction or on avoidance were observed at the very
   low CPF concentration measured in the soils sampled 10 days after
   treatment. Both pesticides caused a reduction in the feeding activity
   under laboratory and field conditions. NRRT was responsive to
   formulations of CPF and GLY. Comet assay showed significantly increased
   DNA damage in earthworms exposed to CPF treated soils. No significant
   differences in DNA migration were observed with GLY treated soils.
   Litterbag field assay showed no differences between treated and control
   plots.
   Discussion. The ecotoxicological effects of pesticides can be assessed
   by monitoring the status of communities in real ecosystems or through
   the use of laboratory toxicity tests. Litterbag field test showed no
   influence of the treatments on the organic matter breakdown, suggesting
   a scarce contribution of soil macrofauna. The bait-lamina test, however,
   seemed to be useful for detecting the effects of GLY and CPF treatments
   on the activity of the soil fauna. CPF failed to give significant
   differences with the controls in the reproduction test and the results
   were not conclusive in the avoidance test. Although the field population
   density of earthworms could be affected by multiple factors, the effects
   observed on the reproduction and avoidance tests caused by GLY could
   contribute to its decrease, with the subsequent loss of their beneficial
   functions. Biomarkers measuring effects on sub-organism level could be
   useful to predict adverse effects on soil organisms and populations.
   Among them, NRRT, a lysosomal destabilization biomarker, resulted in
   demonstrating more sensitivity than the reproduction and avoidance
   tests. The Comet assay was responsive only to CPE Since DNA damage can
   have severe consequences on populations, it could be regarded as an
   important indicator to be used in the assessment of soil health.
   Conclusions. Reproduction and avoidance tests were sensitive indicators
   of GLY exposure, with the former being more labor intensive. Bait-lamina
   test was sensitive to both CPF and GLY. NRRT and Comet assays revealed
   alterations at a subcellular level, and could be considered
   complementary to the biological activity tests. Because of their
   simplicity, some of these bioassays seemed to be appropriate
   pre-screening tests, prior to more extensive and invasive testing.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. This study showed deleterious effects
   of GLY and CPF formulations when applied at the nominal concentrations
   recommended for soya crops. Further validation is needed before these
   endpoints could be used as field monitoring tools in Argentine soya
   soils (ecotoxicological risk assessment - ERA tools).}},

Abstract = {{Wheat-soybean is one of the most dominant cropping systems on the
   Vertisols of central India. Cultivation of durum wheat in winter season
   (November to April) has a considerable potential due to congenial
   climate, while soybean in rainy season (June to October) has witnessed a
   phenomenal growth in the last two decades in the region. Beside
   including a legume (soybean) in sequence with a cereal crop (wheat),
   combined use of available organic sources along with chemical
   fertilizers may prove beneficial for long-term productivity and
   sustainability of the system. A long-term experiment was conducted
   during 1995-2000 on the fine-textured Vertisols at Indore, India to
   study the effect of combined use of farmyard manure (FYM), poultry
   manure, vermicompost and biofertilizers (Azotobacter+phosphate
   solubilizing bacteria) with 0.5 and 1.0 NPK (120 kg N+26.2 kg P+33.3 kg
   K ha(-1)) on wheat, and residual effect on following soybean. Grain
   yield of aestivum wheat in the initial 2 years and durum wheat in the
   later 3 years was significantly increased with 0.5 NPK+poultry manure at
   2.5 t ha(-1) or FYM at 10 t ha(-1) compared with 0.5 NPK alone, and was
   on par with 1.0 NPK. However, the highest productivity was obtained when
   these organic sources were applied along with 1.0 NPK. Quality
   parameters of durum wheat viz protein content, hectolitre weight and
   sedimentation value showed improvement, and yellow berry content was
   significantly lower with combined use of NPK+organic sources compared
   with NPK alone and control. Soybean did not show much response to
   residual effect of nutrient management treatments applied to wheat.
   Wheat gave higher profit than soybean, particularly in the later years
   due to lower grain yields and market price of soybean. However, the
   superiority of FYM as well as poultry manure along with 1.0 NPK was
   evident on the overall profitability of the system. Various soil
   fertility parameters including chemical and biological properties showed
   conspicuous improvement over the initial status under the treatments of
   FYM and poultry manure. Sustainability yield index was maximum under 1.0
   NPK, followed by 1.0 NPK+poultry manure or FYM. It was concluded that
   application of available organic sources, particularly FYM and poultry
   manure along with full recommended dose of NPK fertilizers to wheat was
   essential for improving productivity, grain quality, profitability, soil
   health and sustainability of wheat-soybean system.}},

Abstract = {{Mine tailings are moderately to severely impacted sites that lack normal
   plant cover, soil structure and development, and the associated
   microbial community. In a-rid and semiarid environments, tailings and
   their associated contaminants are prone to eolian dispersion and water
   erosion, thus becoming sources of metal contamination. One approach to
   minimize or eliminate these processes is to establish a permanent
   vegetation cover on tailings piles, Here we report a revegetation trial
   conducted at a moderately impacted mine tailings site in southern
   Arizona. A salt and drought-tolerant plant, four- wing saltbush
   {[}Atriplex canescens (Pursh) Nutt.], was chosen for the trial. A series
   of 3 by 3 m plots were established in quadruplicate on the test site to
   evaluate growth of four-wing saltbush transplants alone or with compost
   addition, Results show that > 80\%, of the transplanted saltbush
   survived after 1.5 yr in both treatments. Enumeration of heterotrophs
   and, community structure analysis wore conducted to monitor bacterial
   community changes during plant establishment as an indicator of plant,
   and soil health. The bacterial community was evaluated using denaturing
   gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of 16S rDNA PCR gene
   products from tailings samples taken beneath transplant canopies.
   Significant, differences in heterotrophic counts and community
   composition were observed between the two, treatments and unplanted
   controls throughout the,trial, but treatment effects were not observed.
   The results suggest that compost is not necessary for plant
   establishment at this site and that plants, rather than added compost,
   is the primary, factor enhancing bacterial heterotrophic counts and
   affecting community composition.}},

Abstract = {{The relative profitability of livestock and cropping fluctuates with
   livestock and grain prices. In recent years, high beef prices and low
   grain prices have meant that well managed pastures have been more
   profitable than grain crops, particularly where grain yields are
   restricted by soil constraints. However, over the last 15 months, world
   grain prices have doubled and the economics of pastures versus grain and
   forage crops have changed.
   While grain production is likely to regain predominance as the most
   profitable farming enterprise on the better farming land of the Darling
   Downs, pastures are still likely to produce profits comparable with
   grain on a per hectare basis, where soil type or land degradation limits
   grain potential to modest yields. Nitrogen benefits and improvements to
   soil health are likely to provide a bonus.
   Pastures appear to be a more profitable and sustainable option than
   forage crops for cultivation on sloping lands of the Darling Downs and
   the western Downs. Livestock producers should seriously consider the
   benefits of pastures versus forage cropping and put a value on soil
   structure, erosion and fertility decline.}},

Abstract = {{The densely populated, intensively cropped subtropical highlands of the
   world have agricultural sustainability problems from soil erosion and
   fertility decline. In 1991, the International Maize and Wheat
   Improvement Center (CIMMYT) initiated a long-term field experiment at
   its semi-arid highland experiment station in Mexico (2240 masl; 19.31
   degrees N, 98.50 degrees W; Cumulic Phaeozem) to investigate the
   long-term effects of tillage/seeding practices, crop rotations, and crop
   residue management on maize and wheat grown under rainfed conditions.
   Soil ecology status contributes to agricultural system sustainability,
   and evaluations were made to determine the effect of different
   management practices on soil microbial biomass (SMB) (substrate-induced
   respiration (SIR) and chloroform fumigation incubation (CFI)) and
   micro-flora physiological and catabolic diversity (BIOLOG (TM) ecoplate
   well system). SMB-C (CFI, SIR) was significantly and respectively 1.2
   and 1.3 times higher for residue retention (average 387 mg C kg(dry
   soil)(-1) and 515 mg C kg(dry soil)(-1), respectively) compared to
   residue removal. SMB-C (CFI) was significantly higher for wheat (369 mg
   C kg(dry soil)(-1)) compared to maize (319 mg C kg(dry soil)(-1)). SMB-N
   (CFI) was significantly 1.3 times higher for residue retention (average
   28 mg N kg(dry soil)(-1)) compared to residue removal. The average well
   color development (AWCD) obtained by the BIOLOG (TM) ecoplate essay
   indicated there were large differences in the catabolic capability of
   soil microbial communities after 15 years of contrasting management
   practices. While maize and wheat rotation under conventional tillage
   with residue retention showed a significantly higher overall AWCD value
   compared to the other treatments, AWCD of maize with zero tillage and
   residue removal was significantly lower than in the other treatments.
   AWCD was significantly higher for residue retention compared to residue
   removal and for wheat as compared to maize. For maize, the management
   practices were divided into two groups; zero tillage with residue
   removal was separate from all other treatments. For wheat, conventional
   tillage was separate from all zero tillage treatments. This study
   suggests that in the target area, a cropping system that includes zero
   tillage, crop rotation, and crop residue retention can increase overall
   biomass and micro-flora activity and diversity compared with common
   farming practices. in the long term, zero tillage combined with residue
   retention creates conditions favourable for the development of
   antagonists and predators, and fosters a new ecological stability. Zero
   tillage without residue retention is an unsustainable practice that
   leads to poor soil health in the long run. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Organic waste materials are being used in huge amounts (tons ha(-1)) for
   improving soil health and crop yields. Recycling of organic wastes
   enriched with nitro-en and L-tryptophan (L-TRP) could convert organic
   waste material into a useful Soil amendment, which may be effective even
   when added in substantially small amounts (kg ha(-1)). Organic waste
   material of fruits and vegetables was collected and subjected to
   composting in a locally fabricated mechanical unit. The composted
   material was enriched with N (120 g kg(-1) compost) and L-tryptophan (10
   mg kg(-1) compost) to convert it into a value added organic fertilizer.
   Effectiveness of the compost enriched with N alone and with N Plus L-TRP
   was compared by applying different rates (300, 400 and 500 kg ha(-1)) to
   wheat in two year field Study. The P and K fertilizers were applied as
   basal treatment in control consisted of P and K fertilizers only.
   Results of field experiments revealed that application of N \&
   L-TRP-enriched compost @ 500 ka ha{''} was as effective as full dose of
   N fertilizer in improving growth and yield of wheat, saving 30\% N
   fertilizer. It significantly improved the yield of wheat by 64\% during
   first year and by 73\% during second year compared with control.
   Similarly, N, P \& K contents of the wheat plants were significantly
   improved upon application of N \& L-TRP-enriched compost @ 500 kg ha(-1)
   compared with control. The technology bears its promise not only to
   improve crop yield on Sustainable basis but also reduce dependence on
   chemical fertilizer as well as huge piles of organic wastes causing
   environmental pollution.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of our research were to evaluate the impact of organic,
   sustainable, and conventional management strategies in grower fields on
   soil physical, chemical, and biological factors including soil microbial
   species and functional diversity and their effect on the Basidiomycete
   plant pathogen Sclerotium rolfsii, causal agent of Southern blight.
   Soils from 10 field locations including conventional, organic and
   sustainable farms were sampled and assayed for disease suppressiveness
   in greenhouse assays, and soil quality indicators. Soils from organic
   and sustainable farms were more suppressive to Southern blight than
   soils from conventional farms. Soils from organic farms had improved
   soil chemical factors and higher levels of extractable C and N, higher
   microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and net mineralizable N. In
   addition, soil microbial respiration was higher in soils from organic
   than sustainable or conventional farms, indicating that microbial
   activity was greater in these soils. Populations of fungi and
   thermophiles were significantly higher in soils from organic and
   sustainable than conventional fields. The diversity of bacterial
   functional communities was also greater in soils from organic farms,
   while species diversity was similar. Soils from organic and sustainable
   farms had improved soil health as indicated by a number of soil
   physical, chemical and biological factors and reduced disease. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{Slugs. Arion ater (L), have been proposed as sentinel organisms to
   assess soil health. In slugs under the influence of pollutants,
   digestive cell loss and the concomitant increase of excretory cells of
   the digestive gland have been described. The aim of the present work was
   to determine up to what extent digestive cell loss affects biomarkers
   and whether the affectation is reversible after exposure to a mixture of
   metal and organic pollutants. Slugs were dosed with a mixture of cadmium
   and kerosene in the food for 27 days. Apart from chemical analyses, the
   volume density of black silver deposits (Vv(BSD)) after
   autometallography, and acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) activity were used as
   biomarkers of exposure to metals and organic compounds, respectively. As
   effect biomarkers, changes in the volume density of the cell types that
   constitute the digestive gland epithelium were calculated. Proliferating
   cells were identified by means of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
   immunohistochemistry. Results revealed that the mixture of pollutants
   provoked an increase in Vv(BSD) and AOX activity and a decrease in the
   number of digestive cells. These changes had no effect in the digestive
   gland accumulation capacity or in the effect and exposure biomarkers
   employed. BrdU-labelling showed that exposure to pollutants provoked an
   enhanced digestive cell proliferation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To assess the optimum dilution of post-methanation distillery effluent,
   a rich source of organic potassium nutrient, 2 sets of fixed plot
   experiments were conducted for 2 consecutive years during 2001-2003 with
   rice (Oryza sativa L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori \&
   Paol.) as test crop grown in sequence. Dilutions of distillery effluent
   with irrigation water significantly affected the grain yield as well as
   biomass production. The highest yield recorded in plots treated with
   pre-sown distillery effluent @ 20 m(3)/ha along with 60 kg N/ha in 2
   split doses. The status of electrical conductivity (0.26-0.33 dS/m),
   organic carbon (0.274.32\%), N (138-172 kg/ha) and K (117-202 kg/ha) was
   significantly increased in effluent treated soils over the control. The
   pre-sown application of diluted distillery effluent @ 20 m(3)/ha was
   optimum for building up soil fertility and increasing the yield of rice
   and wheat in sandy loam soil. Nevertheless the crop performance and
   yield with distillery effluent alone were overall less than that
   produced by distillery effluent with chemical fertilizers probably on
   account of failure of the effluent to supply balanced nutrition to the
   plants for achieving their potential growth capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetable producers are increasingly interested in adopting conservation
   tillage practices to maintain or enhance productivity and soil health,
   but reducing tillage may reduce yields in cool climates. Strategies to
   transition from full-width tillage to zone tillage systems for cabbage
   (Brassica oleracea L. Group capitata) were tested with the goals of
   overcoming soil temperature and compaction limitations and producing
   crop yield and quality equivalent to conventionally tilled. Designed to
   achieve differential soil temperature and compaction levels, the
   treatments were factorial combinations of two widths of zone tillage (15
   and 30 cm) and two depths of zone tillage (10 and 30 cm) plus a
   conventional rototilled treatment (full width and 20-cm depth) as a
   control. To assess the effect of treatments in the transitional year to
   reduced tillage, the experiment was conducted in 2003 and 2004 at
   different fields that were previously conventionally tilled. Increasing
   tillage width from 15 cm to 30 cm increased soil temperature by 1
   degrees C in both years but had a limited effect on cabbage growth and
   no effect on yield. Tillage width and soil temperature may have greater
   impact on an earlier planting. By contrast, increasing tillage depth
   from 10 cm to 30 cm reduced soil penetrometer resistance by up to 1 MPa,
   increased plant growth by 28\%, and increased yield by 22\%. Growth and
   yield in 30-cm depth treatments were similar to conventional tillage,
   indicating the undisturbed, between-row areas in zone tillage treatments
   did not restrict growth. Zone tillage did not affect cabbage maturity or
   quality. Tillage depth was more important to the success of this system
   than tillage width; vertical tillage to 30-cm depth left between 60\%
   and 80\% of the soil surface area undisturbed and can be an effective
   transition to conservation tillage for transplanted cabbage.}},

Abstract = {{Background, Aims and Scope. Soil microbial community diversity has been
   suggested as a way of assessing the `health' or `quality' of soils.
   While molecular (genetic) or biochemical (phenotypic) measurements of
   microbial diversity have their place, functional diversity is popular in
   that it relates to the activity of the soil microflora, particularly in
   the carbon cycle. Community Level Physiological Profiles (CLPPs) are
   usually assessed by carbon substrate utilization. The aim here is to
   review the various methods available for CLPP assessment.
   Main Features. The original method for CLPP determination was based upon
   the Biolog plate with its range of 95 carbon substrates and many studies
   have been employing this over the past 15 years. However, a number of
   criticisms have been leveled at the method, principally that it relies
   upon the growth of an extracted microbial population, which may not
   represent the true functioning of the whole soil. A multiple
   carbon-source, substrate induced respiration method (multi-SIR) was
   developed that did measure the response of the whole soil community
   without the need for growth but it did not have the convenience of the
   microtitre plate format. MicroReSp (TM) was designed to overcome the
   deficiencies in both methods and we have applied it to a range of media
   including mineral and organic soils, sediments and litter. In addition
   we have adapted the method to the testing of a wide range of carbon
   substrates such as hydrocarbons, terpenes and pesticides.
   Results. The MicroReSp (TM) technique covers the middle road of
   relevance and convenience, being a `whole soil' method in a flexible
   microtitre plate format. It also has the advantage that it can be
   adapted for the use of radiolabelled (C-14) substrates, which increases
   the specificity and sensitivity of the assay. A few direct comparisons
   between MicroReSp (TM) have been made. We have found that its
   discriminatory ability compares favourably with Biolog while other users
   have reported it to be superior to the multiple SIR approach. A number
   of laboratories around the world are now utilizing MicroReSp (TM) and
   reporting good sensitivity to changes to the microbial community due to
   such varied factors as age of forest rehabilitation, heavy metal
   treatment, hydrocarbon exposure, salinity, peatland vegetation, cropping
   system and tree clone type.
   Discussion. A comparison of the available methods reveals that each has
   its advantages and drawbacks. The choice of method may depend upon the
   particular hypotheses or questions.
   Conclusions. MicroReSp (TM) offers a convenient, rapid and sensitive
   method for the determination of Community Level Physiological Profiles.
   Its application in a number of case studies has demonstrated its utility
   and advantages over other methods though its full potential for
   characterizing soil activity is yet to be realized. Perspectives.
   Increasing awareness of the environmental pressures on soils and the
   need to monitor soil health has resulted in a range of potential
   indicators. Microbial functional diversity is one such indicator that
   seeks to characterize a core soil attribute. The availability of rapid
   methods for its assessment will aid our understanding of such pressures
   on basic soil functioning.}},

Abstract = {{The necessity of ecologically friendly farming systems coupled with the
   desire for foods free from synthetic chemicals has made organic farming
   one of the fastest-growing agricultural enterprises. The transition from
   conventional agriculture to organic farming is a difficult period for
   several reasons, (1) since it occurs at a time of least experience for
   the growers getting into organic farming, (2) because predator-prey
   links are not fully developed, (3) because farmers usually do not
   receive a full premium for their products and (4) because initial yields
   may be low. Transitioning from conventional to organic farming is at the
   very least region-specific and frequently farm-specific in nature. In
   the southeastern USA the use of perennial grasses such as bahiagrass
   (Paspalum notatum Fluegge) has been shown to have several benefits that
   may be useful in the transition process. Bahiagrass improves soil health
   by reducing erosion, increasing soil organic matter, recovering and
   conserving plant nutrients and promoting good soil structure.
   Furthermore, since bahiagrass is a non-host to most soil-borne
   pathogens, it reduces disease and nematode infestations. The resultant
   increase in soil organic matter from bahiagrass increases the abundance
   of beneficial organisms, which enables the new system to reach
   equilibrium quickly. Leguminous cover crops grown during the winter
   dormancy of bahiagrass provide the necessary nitrogen during the
   transitional stage. Cover crops also reduce weed emergence and improve
   soil structure and water retention. (c) 2007 Society of Chemical

Abstract = {{The grain and sugarcane industries are the dominant cropping enterprises
   in Australia. Both are facing similar problems in maintaining
   productivity and profitability, although the management practices
   employed to achieve these objectives in the two industries differ
   markedly. The farming systems of both industries have evolved in recent
   years as our understanding of the physical and chemical benefits of
   practices like residue retention, reduced tillage and controlled traffic
   have improved. However the impact of such practices is often evaluated
   in terms of cost savings, operational efficiencies and efficient capture
   and use of water.
   Soil health has not always been an important consideration in system
   change in either industry, with the exception that crop rotation has
   always been recognised as important in minimising the impact of
   soil-borne pathogens. Rotations have been a key feature of grain
   cropping systems and short duration legume fallows are becoming more
   prevalent in the sugar industry after more than 25 years of
   monocultures. However, intensification of cropping in recent years has
   meant that the pasture leys that were once a dominant component of the
   grain rotation systems are increasingly being supplanted by short
   duration cropping breaks with grain legume or other non-cereal crops.
   Soil organic C has generally been recognised as an important component
   of soil fertility, but more for the role it plays in soil physical and
   chemical fertility. Links between organic matter status and soil
   biological health, and particularly to farming system viability and
   sustainability, have proven difficult to quantify. This has been partly
   due to a lack of tools or criteria for monitoring relevant soil
   properties and also to our limited understanding of the interactions
   between soil health and other system components. However recent studies
   are suggesting that the amount and quality of organic matter returned as
   roots and residues, and the placement of that residue relative to areas
   of future crop root activity, may be significant factors in the
   sustainable farming systems of the future.
   This paper identifies key issues associated with current and developing
   fanning systems in the grain and sugar industries in Australia, and
   assesses the impact of management practices employed in those systems on
   soil health. It also identifies some key challenges facing soil
   biologists and farming systems researchers who are trying to achieve
   improvements in soil health and sustainability. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Tillage is defined here in a broad sense, including disturbance of the
   soil and crop residues, wheel traffic and sowing opportunities. In
   sub-tropical, semi-arid cropping areas in Australia, tillage systems
   have evolved from intensively tilled bare fallow systems, with high soil
   losses, to reduced and no tillage systems. In recent years, the use of
   controlled traffic has also increased. These conservation tillage
   systems are successful in reducing water erosion of soil and
   sediment-bound chemicals. Control of runoff of dissolved nutrients and
   weakly sorbed chemicals is less certain. Adoption of new practices
   appears to have been related to practical and economic considerations,
   and proved to be more profitable after a considerable period of research
   and development. However there are still challenges. One challenge is to
   ensure that systems that reduce soil erosion, which may involve greater
   use of chemicals, do not degrade water quality in streams. Another
   challenge is to ensure that systems that improve water entry do not
   increase drainage below the crop root zone, which would increase the
   risk of salinity. Better understanding of how tillage practices
   influence soil hydrology, runoff and erosion processes should lead to
   better tillage systems and enable better management of risks to water
   quality and soil health. Finally, the need to determine the
   effectiveness of in-field management practices in achieving stream water
   quality targets in large, multi-land use catchments will challenge our
   current knowledge base and the tools available. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Molecular techniques offer an alternative to time-consuming traditional
   methods of faunal identification based on morphology. The first stage in
   developing a molecular technique is to have a robust method to extract
   DNA. Here methods are assessed using nematodes as a model faunal group.
   A traditional DNA extraction, with proteinase K digestion followed by
   phenol chloroform extraction; sodium hydroxide extraction; and physical
   disruption, followed by utilisation of one of four proprietary PCR
   purification kits were tested for nematode DNA extraction. Nematode
   communities were isolated from a range of habitats (arable agriculture,
   sand dune, coniferous forest, permanent pasture and moorland). Template
   DNA concentration was measured and PCR-amplification performed to test
   the suitability of the extracts for downstream molecular applications.
   DNA extraction with phenol chloroform purification consistently yielded
   high-quality template DNA as did the DNA extraction followed by the
   Purelink PCR purification kit. T-RFLP based on a single enzyme digest
   was sufficient to discriminate between nematode communities extracted
   from all five habitats. In addition, T-RFLP demonstrated that there was
   little difference in perceived nematode community composition following
   amplification of DNA extract purified through either the Qiaquick or
   Purelink kits. Physical disruption of tissue followed by purification
   through a kit provides a rapid, reliable and relatively inexpensive
   method of DNA extraction, yielding high-quality template. We suggest
   that kit suitability should be tested for each habitat under
   investigation as there may be a limited bias between kits for the
   community DNA extracted. Application of high-throughput molecular
   techniques to soil microfauna increases their potential to be used as
   indicators in routine monitoring of soil health. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A sugarcane farming system based on residue retention, minimum tillage,
   a leguminous rotation crop and controlled traffic using global
   positioning system guidance is currently being adopted by the Australian
   sugar industry because it improves sugar yields, reduces costs and
   provides additional income from crops such as soybean and peanut. This
   paper discusses the soil health improvements that are being obtained
   with this new farming system, particularly its beneficial effects on
   soil carbon levels and soil biological properties. It also summarises
   research showing that breaking the sugarcane monoculture with a soybean
   or peanut crop reduces populations of lesion nematode (Pratylenchus
   zeae) and root- knot nematode (Meloidogyne javanica), the two most
   important nematode pests of sugarcane. The role of minimum tillage and
   inputs of organic matter in enhancing the natural biological control
   mechanisms that suppress these nematodes is also discussed. The paper
   then considers the farming system currently used for vegetable crops
   such as tomato, capsicum and rockmelon, where inadequate crop rotation,
   excessive tillage, low organic inputs and the fallowing and solarisation
   effect of covering beds with plastic leads to a situation where soil
   fumigation is seen as the only option for reducing losses from soilborne
   pests and pathogens. Since the sugar industry coexists with the
   vegetable industry in some areas of Australia, the paper argues the case
   for developing minimum tillage practices for vegetable production and
   integrating them into the sugarcane farming system. It concludes that a
   farming system of this nature would improve profitability in both
   industries, produce better environmental outcomes at a landscape level
   and provide more sustainable solutions to nematode and soilborne disease
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{Twospecies of root-lesion nematode (predominantly Pratylenchus thornei
   but also P. neglectus) are widespread pathogens of wheat and other crops
   in Australia's northern grain belt, a subtropical region with deep,
   fertile clay soils and a summer-dominant rainfall pattern. Losses in
   grain yield from P. thornei can be as high as 70\% for intolerant wheat
   cultivars. This review focuses on research which has led to the
   development of effective integrated management programs for these
   nematodes. It highlights the importance of correct identification in
   managing Pratylenchus species, reviews the plant breeding work done in
   developing tolerant and resistant cultivars, outlines the methods used
   to screen for tolerance and resistance, and discusses how planned crop
   sequencing with tolerant and partially resistant wheat cultivars,
   together with crops such as sorghum, sunflower, millets and canaryseed,
   can be used to reduce nematode populations and limit crop damage. The
   declining levels of soil organic matter in cropped soils are also
   discussed with reference to their effect on soil health and biological
   suppression of root-lesion nematodes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a brief overview of the Australian grape industry
   and discusses the distribution and economic importance of its main
   nematode pests and outlines the management practices (hot water
   treatment of planting material, nematode-resistant rootstocks and
   nematicides) that are currently used to minimise losses from nematodes.
   However, the main focus of the paper is the research that will be
   required to improve current practices for managing nematodes. Topics
   covered include: (i) methods of producing nematode-free planting
   material; (ii) breeding programs to develop rootstock material suitable
   for local conditions; (iii) the use of molecular-assisted selection and
   genetic modification to develop transgenic grapevines and rootstocks
   with resistance to several nematode species; (iv) options for enhancing
   naturally occurring biological controls; (v) the introduction of
   agronomic practices that improve the capacity of grapevines to withstand
   attack from nematodes; and (vi) the development of farming systems that
   improve soil physical, chemical and biological properties and enhance
   the suppressiveness of soil to nematodes.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in the use of organic amendments in the
   Australian cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) industry because of perceived
   benefits to soil health and the environment. A 2-year field experiment
   was conducted at the Australian Cotton Research Institute (ACRI), near
   Narrabri, NSW, using three locally available organic amendments applied
   at typical farmers' rates to irrigated cotton. The amendments used were
   cattle manure (10 t/ha), composted cotton gin trash (7.5 t/ha), and a
   commercial liquefied vermicompost (50 L/ha), and their effects on soil
   quality characteristics were compared with those of control soil where
   no amendment was added. The soil (0-0.10 m) was sampled on six occasions
   and analysed for selected chemical and microbiological properties. The
   physiological characteristics and nutrient uptake of mature cotton
   plants were also examined.
   The organic amendments did not have a significant effect on
   microbiological properties as measured by microbial biomass and
   respiration. Of the chemical properties measured, manure-amended plots
   showed higher nitrate-nitrogen, available phosphorus, and exchangeable
   potassium (K) concentrations over 2 years. Exchangeable K was 28\%
   higher where cattle manure was applied than in control plots during the
   active growth stage of cotton in the first year of experiment. Higher
   nutrient uptake by mature cotton plants and lower nutrient concentration
   in soil were observed in the second year. Cotton physiological
   properties and lint yield were not significantly affected by the
   application of organic amendments. Seasonal parameters had a strong
   effect. The results suggest that there are few short-term benefits to be
   gained in terms of soil quality from application of organic amendments
   to Vertosols at the rates used in these trials.}},

   over the world. Saccharomyces cerevisiae biomass plays an important role
   in the investigations in the field of heavy metal biosorption. It can
   accumulate metal ions in biomass (Volesky and Phillips, 1995). The
   purpose of the present study is to examine the tolerance of S.
   cerevisiae strains to toxicity of Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+ or Ni2+. Secondly, to
   study how alkaline metals (Ca2+, Mg2+ or K+) correct the negative
   effects of heavy metals on yeast growth.}},

Abstract = {{During the examinations we isolated bacteria from soil of some areas
   which are covered by litter and have previously been under crop. Our aim
   was to point out the possible differences in the lipid composition in
   case of bacterium strains of certain bacterium species which are living
   in the four different and diversely polluted ecological habitats. The
   environment can change and affect the bacterial lipid composition. The
   diversity of microorganism in soil is a critical factor, regarding the
   maintenance of good soil health. Changes in fatty acid composition of
   bacteria can indicate the environmental load on soils. According to our
   results, we can establish that different soil pollutions induce
   qualitative and quantitative changes in the lipid composition of
   microorganisms. FAME (fatty acid methyl-ester)-analysis can be
   effectively used for demodulation of environmental stress factors.
   According to our results, we can establish that different soil

Abstract = {{Soil is an essential resource with capabilities to recover. Extensive
   mining activities have been going on in Biscay (Basque Country, Spain)
   for centuries, and old mines and their surroundings may still contain
   high metal deposits. It is important to measure the available fraction
   of the metal pool in order to understand better the behaviour of metals
   in the soil-water-organisms system and to improve risk assessment. Two
   methods have been used in this experiment for measuring the exchangeable
   metal fraction, the modifications of the sequential extraction procedure
   described by Tessier and the DIN 19730 German standard. Moreover, the
   water soluble metal fraction has also been measured. The toxicity of the
   abandoned Karrantza mine soil to the organisms has been determined with
   Vibrio fischeri, Eisenia fetida and lettuce and radish seeds. The
   objective of the present work is to demonstrate that the methodology
   employed in the present work is adequate and cost effective for an
   integrated assessment of the soil health status. Moreover, the use of a
   combination of biomarkers and OECD test with E. fetida seems to
   constitute a reliable methodology for future soil evaluation. Results
   show that Karrantza soil contains very high available Zn, Pb and Cd. The
   lettuce seeds are unable to germinate when exposed to Karrantza soil,
   and E. fetida die within 3 days of exposure to Karrantza soil.
   V.fischeri bioassay shows a reduction in luminescence when exposed to
   Karrantza soil. The NRU assay also shows a clear difference when exposed
   to Karrantza soil and the non polluted soil.
   In conclusion, the methodology employed in this experiment demonstrated
   in an adequate and cost effective way, that the mine soil was
   significantly more toxic to the organisms when compared to non polluted
   soil, indicating the low soil health quality of the mine soil.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty-five soils were sampled from three sites at different distances
   from chromium slag heap of a Iron-alloy factory, namely, nine from site
   A located under the chromium slag and eighteen from Site B in the
   vicinity of the factory and eight from site C far from the factory. The
   contents of total Cr in these soils from site A, B and C were 1666.0 +/-
   1310.9 mg.kg(-1) 1,1136.2 +/- 1844.6 mg.kg(-1), 300.4 +/- 165.1
   mg.kg(-1), respectively. The contents of water soluble Cr were 59.3 +/-
   77.57 mg.kg(-1), 0.6 +/- 0.3 mg.kg(-1), 0.5 +/- 0.3 mg.kg(-1),
   respectively. In order to evaluate soil health, the activities of four
   soil enzymes (catalase, polyphenol oxidase, dehydrogenase, alkaline
   phosphatases) were analyzed. The results have shown that dehydrogenase
   activity was greatly depressed by conditions in the heavy
   chromium-contaminated sites. Negative correlation was observed between
   dehydrogenase activity and the distance from the chromium slag heap,
   however, the activities of catalase, polyphenol oxidase, alkaline
   phosphatases in soils from the three sampling sites mentioned above did
   not differ significantly. The result imply that of dehydrogenase
   activity could be used as an indicator for the chromium pollution level
   in the area of Iron-Alloy factory and for the stability level of the
   soil ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Soil samples taken from a sewage irrigation area, a partial sewage
   irrigation area and a ground water irrigation area (control area) were
   studied with the methods of Biolog and FAME. It was found that the
   microbial utilization of carbon sources in sewage irrigation areas was
   much higher than that of control area (P < 0.05). With the increasing of
   the amount of sewage irrigation, microbial functional diversity slightly
   increased by the Biolog analysis; however, the amount of epiphyte
   decreased by the FAME analysis. The results also showed that the Cr, Zn
   contents were positively correlated with the values of AWCD and the
   microbial diversity, while Hg content showed negative correlation with
   the microbial parameters (AWCD of 72 h and Shannon index). Our studies
   suggested that sewage irrigation resulted in an obvious increase of
   heavy metals content in soil (P < 0.05), although the maximum heavy
   metals concentrations were much lower than the current standard of
   China. Other soil basic characteristics such as cation exchange capacity
   (CEC), total nitrogen (N-t) and organic matter in sewage irrigation
   areas obviously increased (P < 0.05). Therefore, it is demonstrated that
   long-term sewage irrigation had influenced soil microorganisms and soil
   quality in the studied soils. As a result, it is important to monitor
   the changes in agricultural soils. Furthermore, our results also
   confirmed that the methods of Biolog and FAME are effective tools for
   the assessment of soil microbial structure/function and soil health. (C)

Abstract = {{Microorganisms respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions.
   Therefore microbes are generally considered as sensitive indicators of
   soil health. The aim of this study was to assess the biological
   fertility status and sustainability of three differently managed
   agricultural soils by using microbial indicators. Management practices
   involved a soil with minimum treatment (biodynamic); a soil
   characterized by periodic application of manure and chemical fertilizer
   (manure); and a soil characterized by depurated and stabilized organic
   sludge amendment (sludge). Samples were taken four times during a year,
   at two depths: 0-15 and 15-30 cm. An extensive characterization of soil
   organic matter was carried out. Biochemical parameters included
   metabolic quotient, mineralization quotient and kinetic parameters of
   microbial decomposition of soil organic matter. Community level
   physiological profile analysis (CLPP) was used to investigate soil
   microbial energetic strategies adopted in differently managed soils.
   Total amounts of fungi and bacteria were determined by direct
   microscopy. Indicators related to labile and humic organic matter
   fractions suggest significantly lower soil fertility and lower
   sustainability in the sludge amended treatment. Differences between the
   biodynamic treatment and Manure treatment were less consistent.
   Eco-physiological quotients and kinetic parameters of C-mineralization
   indicated a steady state in the biodynamic treatment and stressed
   conditions in the sludge treatment. Microbial communities seem to adopt
   a typically K-strategy (persistent) in the biodynamic treatment and a
   typically r-strategy (opportunists) in the sludge treatment. Manure
   management shows an intermediate result: the superficial layer is
   characterized by r-strategrists and the deeper layer by K-strategists.}},

   soil health using nematode communities as bioindicators. The community
   of the biological-managed site community had the highest taxonomic and
   trophic diversity and maturity. The food web was fairly good structured
   and this site was in better conditions in comparison with the others.
   The sewage-managed site had the highest enrichment condition, but the
   lowest nematode density. Finally, the community of the manure-managed
   site was the worst and the least diversified and structured, being
   dominated by plant feeders, especially by the genus Para-tylenchus,
   whose high density can be related to ecological degradation.}},

Abstract = {{The management of agricultural land includes a variety of agronomic
   practices that can affect physical, chemical and biological properties
   of soil. Soil bioindicators can be very useful to detect changes in soil
   quality, and among them soil fauna can be profitably applied to monitor
   the soil health status. Different groups of soil invertebrate are used
   as bioindicators or biotests; in some cases the biological indicators
   are represented by a single taxon, while in other cases the entire
   microarthropod community is assessed. In this study, the evaluation of
   different agronomic regimen has been realized using the QBS indexes
   (arthropods and collembola) and Folsomia candida test. The QBS results
   showed the expected seasonal variation and were more affected by soil
   characteristics than agronomic regimen, with the lowest values recorded
   by the byodinamic farm; also the Folsomia candida tests crave similar
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was undertaken to assess the impact of surface
   application of different levels of crop residue on predominant
   biological soil health indicators and release of CO2 fluxes from the
   surface soil as a result of microbial respiration under minimum tillage
   conditions. The experiment was conducted in a rainfed Semi-Arid Tropical
   (SAT) Alfisol at Hayathnagar Research Farm of Central Research Institute
   for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad. Studies indicated that an
   application of 6 t ha(-1) of sorghum stover recorded significantly
   highest microbial biomass carbon of 177.11 and 167.83 mu g g(-1) of soil
   and highest DHA (Dehydrogenase Assay) of 2.49 and 1.74 mu g TPF g(-1)
   hr(-1) at surface and subsurface layers respectively. Similarly, the
   activity of arylsulphatase was also significantly influenced by residue
   application and was highest at 6 t ha(-1) plot (150.755 mu g PNP g(-1)
   hr(-1)) irrespective of soil depth. The activities of other soil enzymes
   such as urease, acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase were also
   significantly influenced at both the soil depths by graded levels of
   residue applications. On an average. quantitatively, biological soil
   quality indicators attained higher values in surface soil compared to
   subsurface soils. The CO2 flux significantly increased with the
   increasing levels of surface applied sorghum crop residue upto 4t ha(-1)
   under minimum tillage conditions. Thus, the biological soil quality
   indicators were significantly influenced with residue application under
   minimum tillage in these Alfisols.}},

Abstract = {{The soil microorganisms at different depths play an important role in
   soil formation, ecosystem biogeochemistry, recycling of nutrients, and
   degradation of waste products. The aims of this study were to observe
   the microbial diversity in the profile of an agricultural soil in
   northern China, and to research the correlation between soil microbes
   and geochemistry. First, the soil geochemistry of the profile was
   investigated through 25 chemical elements. Secondly, the various
   physiological groups of microorganisms were studied by traditional
   culture methods. Thirdly, the functional diversity on sole carbon source
   utilization (SCSU) was evaluated by the BIOLOG system. Finally, the
   correlation between the soil microbial diversity and geochemistry was
   analyzed statistically. The results showed that the amounts and
   proportions of various physiological groups of microorganisms changed
   with depth. The bacterial functional diversity on SCSU decreased with
   increasing depth, but evenness of the substrate utilization increased.
   Although the microbial metabolic diversity was different at every depth,
   it could be classified into three main groups by principal component
   analysis and cluster analysis. The various physiological groups of
   microorganisms showed remarkable correlation with relevant soil chemical
   elements. The sensitive microbial indicators of soil health were
   expected to be screened out from actinomyces or ammonifying bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Maintenance of proper soil fertility, through application of a balanced
   mix of various nutrients, is important for maintaining sustainable crop
   production levels. Soil testing is a crucial step in this direction.
   This paper describes soil testing as a multi-dimensional concept
   comprising seven aspects. Awareness of these factors among farmers is
   computed, examined, and statistically analyzed using survey data
   collected from three categories of farmers-small, medium and large-in
   four districts of the Uttar Pradesh state in India. The impact of a
   World Bank-aided project-Diversified Agriculture Support Project-is also
   assessed in terms of dissemination of soil testing knowledge. Results
   indicate that project interventions had a significant and variable soil
   impact on farmers awareness of and likelihood of adopting soil testing
   in four districts. The findings have implications for policy-makers and
   researchers who are interested in improving the production and
   productivity of crops in developing economies.}},

   was found significant on pod yield for three years out of five years.
   Organic carbon built up and increase in available potassium in the soil
   was observed when 100\% recommended dose of nutrients were applied
   through organic source. Increase in soil available phosphorus (142
   kg/ha) noticed from the initial level (46.9 kg/ha) with recommended dose
   of nutrients applied through inorganics. Soil bulk density was
   influenced neither by tillage practice nor nutrient source.}},

Abstract = {{Indigenous communities of soil-resident nematodes have a high potential
   for soil health assessment as nematodes are diverse, abundant,
   trophically heterogeneous and easily extractable from soil. The
   conserved morphology of nematodes is the main operational reason for
   their under-exploitation as soil health indicators, and a user-friendly
   biosensor system should preferably be based on nonmorphological traits.
   More than 80\% of the most environmental stress-sensitive nematode
   families belong to the orders Mononchida and Dorylaimida. The
   phylogenetic resolution offered by full-length small subunit ribosomal
   DNA (SSU rDNA) sequences within these two orders is highly different.
   Notwithstanding several discrepancies between morphology and SSU
   rDNA-based systematics, Mononchida families (indicated here as M1-M5)
   are relatively well-supported and, consequently, family-specific DNA
   sequences signatures could be defined. Apart from Nygolaimidae and
   Longidoridae, the resolution among Dorylaimida families was poor.
   Therefore, a part of the more variable large subunit rDNA (approximate
   to 1000 bp from the 5'-end) was sequenced for 72 Dorylaimida species.
   Sequence analysis revealed a subclade division among Dorylaimida (here
   defined as D1-D9, PP1-PP3) that shows only distant similarity with
   `classical' Dorylaimid systematics. Most subclades were trophically
   homogeneous, and - in most cases - specific morphological
   characteristics could be pinpointed that support the proposed division.
   To illustrate the practicability of the proposed molecular framework, we
   designed primers for the detection of individual subclades within the
   order Mononchida in a complex DNA background (viz. in terrestrial or
   freshwater nematode communities) and tested them in quantitative assays
   (real-time polymerase chain reaction). Our results constitute
   proof-of-principle for the concept of DNA sequence signatures-based
   monitoring of stress sensitive nematode families in environmental
   samples.}},

Title = {{Assessing the relationship between patch type and soil mites: A
   molecular approach}},
Journal = {{PEDOBIOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{51}},

Pages = {{445-461}},
Abstract = {{An urgent need exists for indicators of soil health and patch
   functionality in extensive rangelands that can be measured efficiently
   and at tow cost. Soil mites are candidate indicators, but their
   identification and handling is so specialised and time-consuming that
   their inclusion in routine monitoring is unlikely. The aim of this study
   was to measure the relationship between patch type and mite assemblages
   using a conventional approach. An additional aim was to determine if a
   molecular approach traditionally used for soil microbes could be adapted
   for soil mites to overcome some of the bottlenecks associated with soil
   fauna diversity assessment. Soil mite species abundance and diversity
   were measured using conventional ecological methods in soil, from
   patches with perennial grass and litter cover (PGL), and compared to
   soil from bare patches with annual grasses and/or litter cover (BAL).
   Soil mite assemblages were also assessed using a molecular method called
   terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. The
   conventional, data showed a relationship between patch type and mite
   assemblage. The Prostigmata and Oribatida were well represented in the
   PGL sites, particularly the Aphelacaridae (Oribatida). For T-RFLP
   analysis, the mite community was represented by a series of DNA fragment
   lengths that reflected mite sequence diversity. The T-RFLP data showed a
   distinct difference in the mite assemblage between the patch types.
   Where possible, T-RFLP peaks were matched to mite families using a
   reference 18S rDNA database, and the Aphelacaridae prevalent in the
   conventional samples at PGL sites were identified, as were prostigmatids
   and oribatids. We identified limits to the T-RFLP approach and this
   included an inability to distinguish some species whose DNA sequences
   were similar. Despite these limitations, the data still showed a clear
   difference between sites, and the molecular taxonomic inferences also
   compared welt with the conventional ecological data. The results from
   this study indicated that the T-RFLP approach was effective in measuring
   mite assemblages in this system. The power of this technique ties in the
   fact that species diversity and abundance data can be obtained quickly
   because of the time taken to process hundreds of samples, from soil DNA
   extraction to data output on the gene analyser, can be as little as 4
   days. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is a lacking on information about the role of forage legumes to
   improve soil fertility on native pastures within tropical Mexico. Under
   this type of vegetation, continuous incorporation of residues from
   introduced forage legumes may contribute, from the N stored on its
   organic matter, to soil health restoring. Nitrogen soil mineralization
   using both anaerobic (ANA) and aerobic (AER) laboratory incubation
   methods was assessed in Ultisols soil samples at 0-5, 5-15 and 15-30 cm
   depths, from four tropical native pasture sites located at Veracruz,
   Mexico. Each pasture was associated to the introduced forage legume
   Arachis pintoi, with 3, 5, 8 and 11 yr after the forage legume was
   introduced. Also, pure stands of native pasture sites no mixed to A.
   pintoi were used as reference sites. In all cases mineralization rate
   decreased with the depth; AER method confirmed ANA results, since only 5
   A. pintoi years old site yielded more mineralized N (207 +/- 3.4 mu g N
   g(-1) soil) than native pasture soils (166 +/- 3.1 mu g N g(-1) soil).
   Topsoil (0-5 cm) mineralized more N (104 +/- 7.0 mu g N g(-1)) than 5-15
   cm soil depth (70 +/- 5.4 mu g N g(-1)). Although no significant
   positive effect of the legume on N mineralization with either method was
   observed, discussion is focused regarding to define if differences
   between types of pastures were due to low inherent soil N rather than
   changes in soil organic matter quality.}},

Abstract = {{Organic growers are required to maintain or improve soil chemical,
   biological, and physical properties and thus need to integrate
   biological processes into fertility management. However, few guidelines
   exist for satisfying tree nutrient demands ecologically. Sound nitrogen
   (N) management is a key component for overall orchard productivity
   whereas poor N management may result in multiple environmental impacts,
   including runoff to surface or leaching to groundwater sources. Many
   growers substitute synthetic inputs with rapid-release, approved N
   fertilizers that have little effect on long-term soil health and
   fertility. The authors seek an alternative approach for synchronizing
   nutrient availability with tree demand that relies on managing soil
   biological communities to attain their maximum potential functionality
   and thus meet tree nutrient demand. This paper outlines a new conceptual
   framework with which to evaluate a variety of soil functions that are
   quantified using biological, microbial, and biochemical properties in
   relation to overall orchard performance. By combining information
   gathered from soil faunal indices (nematode community structure and
   diversity analyses) with data obtained by biochemical and microbial
   analyses of the soil samples, a new, in-depth view of soil communities
   and their response to management practices will be obtained. As a
   result, a better understanding of the effects of differing management
   practices on soil fertility and community structure will be gained. This
   approach is currently being investigated by our group in organic and
   integrative sweet cherry orchards. Our goal is to determine which soil
   parameters may be used to help orchardists optimize soil health while
   maintaining orchard productivity. Furthermore, we wish to validate a
   number of assumptions that are commonly made regarding each soil
   parameter tested across multiple management, soil, and climate types.}},

Abstract = {{Earthworms are all essential part of the soil fauna in many global
   soils, represent a significant proportion of the soil biomass and are
   regarded as a useful indicator of soil health and quality (Edwards,
   2004). They are also often the subject of inoculation programmes during
   the restoration of degraded lands (Butt, 1999) and the inoculation of
   earthworms to metal-contaminated soils has been suggested (Dickinson,
   2000) largely due to the role earthworms are known to play in soil
   formation at such sites (Frouz el al., 2007).}},

Abstract = {{The leaf litter is the major source of soil organic matter in natural
   and many plantation crop ecosystems. Quantity and quality of organic
   matter in a soil ecosystem is of utmost importance in regulating the
   soil health. Hence assessment of quality of organic matter input, viz.,
   litter is important and is attempted in this study. The leaf litter of
   rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), pueraria (Pueraria phaseoloides), mucuna
   (Mucuna bracteata), teak (Tectona grandis) and forest (mixed species)
   were analyzed using solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to
   study the relative abundance of different carbon compounds present. The
   spectra revealed that litter of all species studied contain relatively
   larger amounts of polysaccharides compared to other C containing
   compounds. Also it could be observed that the alkyl-C to O-alkyl-C ratio
   of rubber litter was much higher compared to that of others. Aromatics
   and carbonyl compounds were also present in all litter species. The
   resource quality based on alkyl-C to O-alkyl-C ratio of the litter
   samples studied can be arranged in the order pueraria > teak > mucuna >
   forest > rubber. The respiration rate, substrate induced respiration
   rate and biomass-C (Cmic) of the litter samples were estimated. It could
   be observed that litter associated microbial activity decreased as
   alkyl-C to O-alkyl-C ratio increased. Resource quality derived from the
   NMR spectra and the litter biological properties were complementary.
   Soil samples (0-15 cm) from the five soil ecosystems (rubber, pueraria,
   mucuna, teak and forest) were analyzed for respiration rate, substrate
   induced respiration rate, Cmic, total-C and total-N. The forest soil had
   higher respiration rate, total-C and total-N compared to cultivated soil
   systems. Pueraria, mucuna and teak soils were comparable for their
   biological properties while rubber soil recorded comparatively lower
   microbial activity.}},

Abstract = {{Soil health is presented as an integrative property that reflects the
   capacity of soil to respond to agricultural intervention, so that it
   continues to support both the agricultural production and the provision
   of other ecosystem services. The major challenge within sustainable soil
   management is to conserve ecosystem service delivery while optimizing
   agricultural yields. It is proposed that soil health is dependent on the
   maintenance of four major functions: carbon transformations; nutrient
   cycles; soil structure maintenance; and the regulation of pests and
   diseases. Each of these functions is manifested as an aggregate of a
   variety of biological processes provided by a diversity of interacting
   soil organisms under the influence of the abiotic soil environment.
   Analysis of current models of the soil community under the impact of
   agricultural interventions ( particularly those entailing substitution
   of biological processes with fossil fuel-derived energy or inputs)
   confirms the highly integrative pattern of interactions within each of
   these functions and leads to the conclusion that measurement of
   individual groups of organisms, processes or soil properties does not
   suffice to indicate the state of the soil health. A further conclusion
   is that quantifying the flow of energy and carbon between functions is
   an essential but non-trivial task for the assessment and management of
   soil health.}},

Abstract = {{The green revolution of the 1960s and 1970s which resulted in dramatic
   yield increases in the developing Asian countries is now showing signs
   of fatigue in productivity gains. Intensive agriculture practiced
   without adherence to the scientific principles and ecological aspects
   has led to loss of soil health, and depletion of freshwater resources
   and agrobiodiversity. With progressive diversion of arable land for
   nonagricultural purposes, the challenge of feeding the growing
   population without, at the same time, annexing more forestland and
   depleting the rest of life is indeed daunting. Further, even with food
   availability through production/procurement, millions of marginal
   farming, fishing and landless rural families have very low or no access
   to food due to lack of income-generating livelihoods. Approximately 200
   million rural women, children and men in India alone fall in this
   category. Under these circumstances, the evergreen revolution
   (pro-nature, pro-poor, pro-women and pro-employment/ livelihood oriented
   ecoagriculture) under varied terms are proposed for achieving
   productivity in perpetuity. In the proposed `biovillage paradigm',
   eco-friendly agriculture is promoted along with on- and non-farm
   eco-enterprises based on sustainablemanagement of natural resources.
   Concurrently, the modern ICT-based village knowledge centres provide
   time-and locale-specific, demand-driven information needed for evergreen
   revolution and ecotechnologies. With a system of `farm and marine
   production by masses', the twin goals of ecoagriculture and
   eco-livelihoods are addressed. The principles, strategies and models of
   these are briefly discussed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Soil enzymes are indicators of microbial activities in soil and are
   often considered as an indicator of soil health and fertility. They are
   very sensitive to the agricultural practices, pH of the soil, nutrients,
   inhibitors and weather conditions. To understand the effect of an
   insecticide, acetamiprid (IUPAC Name: (E)-N1-{[}(6-chloro-3-pyridyl)
   methyl]-N2-cyano-N1-methyl acetamidine) on different soil enzyme
   activities, the experiments were conducted for three consecutive years
   (2003-2005) at control and cotton experimental fields of Indian
   Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and natural area (ridges with
   forest) in Delhi. The combined results for all three years were
   presented here to understand the impact of acetamiprid on soil enzyme
   activities. Acetamipruid was applied three times in one crop season
   after 41, 48 and 73 days of sowing, to control the pest. Soil of treated
   fields was analyzed for insecticide residues immediately after first
   insecticide treatment and thereafter at definite period. The residues of
   acetamiprid in experimental soil was varied from 0.30 +/- 0.13 to 22.67
   +/- 0.2 mu g g(-1) d.wt. soil, during the crop period of 2003. The
   insecticide residues for 2004 ranged between 0.59 +/- 0.38 and 13.42 +/-
   0.71 mu g g(-1) d.wt. soil and for 2005 it ranged between 0.48 +/- 0.22
   and 19.81 +/- 0.33 mu g g(-1) d.wt. soil. An average half life of
   acetamiprid in our treated field was 11.2 +/- 1.7 days for all three
   years. Similarly, the soil from natural area and control were also
   tested for insecticide residues. No detectable insecticide residues had
   been found. Soil from three localities i.e. natural, control and
   experimental fields were tested for different enzyme activities. Nitrate
   reductase, arginine deaminase, urease and dehydrogenase activities were
   high in natural soil in comparison to control soil and insecticide
   treated soil in all three experimental years. At the same time, nitrate
   reductase activity was all time low in acetamiprid treated soil.
   Acetamiprid had inhibitory effects on nitrate reductase, arginine
   deaminase and urease activities. After first treatment (43 days after
   crop sowing), nitrate reductase (4 1\%), arginine deaminase (22\%) and
   urease (35\%) activities were declined. Dehydrogenase activity increased
   to 22\% after first insecticide application. Enzyme activities were
   recovered at the end of each crop season. Therefore, it can be
   attributed that agricultural practices, weather conditions and use of
   acetamiprid might be responsible for the different level of enzyme
   activities in soil. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Shortages of labor, water and the adverse effects of puddling on soil
   health are forcing farmers to switch rice production systems from
   puddled transplant to direct seeding. In recent years, resource
   conservation technologies (RCTs) like zero-tillage (ZT) and bed-planting
   are being promoted in the rice-wheat cropping systems of South Asia to
   address these concerns. However, weed control is a serious challenge in
   non-puddled, direct-seeded ZT/bed-planted rice. In the absence of weed
   control, rice yields are reduced by 35-100\% in direct-seeded/RCTs
   systems. Herbicide-resistant rice (HR-rice) may facilitate adoption of
   RCTs by improving weed management options. The three major direct
   benefits of introducing HR-rice are to: (1) improve control of weeds
   specifically associated with rice, e.g. weedy Oryza species; (2)
   substitute currently used herbicides with new ones that are more
   efficient and that have better environmental profiles; and (3) provide
   new tools for managing weeds that have already developed resistance to
   current herbicides. In this paper, we discuss the current issues
   associated with the rice-wheat systems of India and role of HR-rice in
   addressing weed management constraints of direct-seeded rice.
   Direct-seeded ZT/bed-planted rice will save water, labor cost and
   drudgery involved in transplanting. Other potential benefits include
   improvement in soil health, timely sowing of wheat, and reduction in
   greenhouse gases. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Agroecosystem health derives from a combination of biophysical and
   socioeconomic conditions that jointly influence such properties as
   productivity, sustainability, stability, and equitability. In this case
   study, we describe and analyze a method to quantify agroecosystem health
   through a combination of geographically referenced data at various
   spatial scales. Six key variables were hypothesized to provide a minimum
   set of conditions required to quantify agroecosystem health: soil
   health, biodiversity, topography, farm economics, land economics, and
   social organization. Each of these key variables was quantified by one
   or more attributes of a study area near Wooster, Ohio. Data sources
   included remote sensing, digital elevation models, soil maps, county
   auditor records, and a structured questionnaire of landowners in the
   study area. These data were combined by an analytical hierarchy process
   to yield an agroecosystem health index. The two steps in the process
   were first to combine the data at the pixel scale (30 m(2)) into key
   variables with normalized values, and then to combine the key variables
   into the final index. The analytical hierarchy process model was
   developed by panels of experts for each key variable and by participants
   in the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center's
   Agroecosystems Management Program for the final agroecosystem health
   index value. Observed spatial patterns of the agroecosystem health index
   were then analyzed with respect to the underlying data. Consistent with
   our hypothesis and the definition of agroecosystems, spatial patterns in
   the agroecosystem health index were an emergent property of combined
   socioeconomic and biophysical conditions not apparent in any of the
   underlying data or key variables. The method proposed in this study
   permits estimation of agroecosystem health as a function of specific
   underlying conditions, which combine in complex ways. Because values of
   the agroecosystem health index and the data underlying them can be
   analyzed for a particular landscape, the method proposed could be useful
   to policy makers, educators, service agencies, organizations, and the
   people who live in the area for finding opportunities to improve the
   health of their agroecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive agriculture is spectacularly successful since last couple of
   decades due to the inputs viz; fertilizers and pesticides along with
   high yielding varieties. The mandate for agriculture development was to
   feed and adequate nutrition supply to the expanding population by side
   the agriculture would be entering to into new area of commercial and
   export orientation. The attention of public health and proper
   utilization natural resources are also the main issues related with
   agriculture development. Concern for pesticide contamination in the
   environment in the current context of pesticide use has assumed great
   importance {[}1]. The fate of the pesticides in the soil environment in
   respect of pest control efficacy, non-target organism exposure and
   offsite mobility has been given due consideration {[}2]. Kinetics and
   pathways of degradation depend on abiotic and biotic factors {[}6],
   which are specific to a particular pesticide and therefore find
   preference. Adverse effect of pesticidal chemicals on soil
   microorganisms {[}3], may affect soil fertility {[}4] becomes a foreign
   chemicals major issue. Soil microorganisms show an early warning about
   soil disturbances by foreign chemicals than any other parameters.
   But the fate and behavior of these chemicals in soil ecosystem is very
   important since they are degraded by various factors and have the
   potential to be in the soil, water etc. So it is indispensable to
   monitor the persistence, degradation of pesticides in soil and is also
   necessary to study the effect of pesticide on the soil quality or soil
   health by in depth studies on soil microbial activity.
   The removal of metabolites or degraded products should be removed from
   soil and it has now a day's primary concern to the environmentalist.
   Toxicity or the contamination of pesticides can be reduced by the
   bioremediation process which involves the uses of microbes or plants.
   Either they degrade or use the pesticides by various co metabolic
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of productivity on agricultural soils disturbed by
   industrial activity is important for agronomic and environmental
   reasons. Because of the role of organic matter in soil health and
   quality, organic amendments have been widely used in the reclamation of
   disturbed soils such as those on abandoned oil and natural gas
   wellsites. This study examined the effects of one-time applications of
   alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay or beef cattle (Bos taurus) feedlot
   manure compost on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield and nutrient uptake
   on two abandoned natural gas wellsites that had recently been reclaimed
   in southern Alberta, Canada. The base amendment rate (1x) {[}dry wt.]
   was 5.3 Mg ha(-1) for compost and 3.1 Mg ha(-1) for alfalfa. The five
   treatment amendment rates of 0, 1x, 2x, 4x, and 8x were
   soil-incorporated at the wellsites. Yields and plant nutrient uptake
   were generally higher at Hussar than at Turin, reflecting the higher
   inherent fertility of the soil at Hussar. Grain yields were similar for
   alfalfa and compost amendments, indicating that either amendment can be
   used depending on availability and/or transportation costs. Our results
   show that spring wheat yields on these reclaimed soils can be optimized
   at alfalfa and compost rates of no more than 6 and 10 Mg ha(-1),
   respectively. Continued monitoring of crop productivity and soil
   properties may provide insight into the long-term benefits of alfalfa
   and compost amendments in wellsite reclamation schemes.}},

Abstract = {{In order to tackle poverty and hunger in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) there
   is a strong case for a focus of effort on improving rainfed agricultural
   systems. The challenge is to deliver a transformation of agricultural
   productivity in such systems without adverse impacts on environmental
   goods and services. We examine the growing advocacy of `conservation
   agriculture' (CA) as the desired approach and assess the evidence to
   support the assertion that it can deliver sustainable agricultural
   development in SSA. We examine in particular the evidence which derives
   from experience with `zero tillage sustainable agriculture' in Brazil.
   We ask the question, is there a case for a paradigm shift in land
   husbandry? The case for a paradigm shift hangs on the premise that
   conventional practice promotes land degradation, while adoption of CA
   practice delivers a range of benefits through promoting soil ecosystem
   health. The guiding principle is to promote biological tillage through
   minimizing mechanical soil disturbance and maintaining permanent organic
   soil cover. We examine evidence of benefits in the context of the wider
   debate on low-external Input technology. We conclude that CA does not
   overcome constraints on low-external-input systems and will deliver the
   productivity gains that are required to achieve food security and
   poverty targets only if farmers have access to fertilizers and
   herbicides. We conclude also that widespread adoption of the new
   paradigm amongst millions of small farmers in order to achieve the
   `doubly green revolution' in SSA is subject to the familiar constraints
   of knowledge transfer and success will depend upon creating innovation
   networks. Further, we conclude that amongst small-scale farmers partial
   adoption will be the norm and it is not clear that this will deliver
   soil health benefits claimed for full adoption of the new paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{The sustainability of a farm system greatly relies on fertilizers and
   other inputs. Soil factors such as texture and local rainfall, along
   with management-related factors such as soil organic matter, aggregate
   stability and agronomic practices, have much greater influence on the
   sustainability of any given farm than do the type or amount of soil
   amendments. Growers use a wide variety of practices to maintain or
   improve soil health in organic vegetable production systems. These
   practices generally are part of long-term, site-specific management
   programs that aim at developing fertile and biologically active soils
   that readily capture and store water and nutrients, have good tilth, and
   suppress plant diseases. Field experiments were conducted in 2005 and
   2006 in Mashhad, Iran, to study the effects of organic amendments,
   synthetic fertilizers and compost extracts on crop health, productivity
   and storability of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Treatments
   included different fertilizers of cattle, sheep and poultry manures,
   green-waste and household composts and chemical fertilizers of urea and
   superphosphate; and five aqueous extracts from cattle manure, poultry
   manures, green-waste, and household composts plus water as control. Our
   results show that application of poultry manure showed lower disease
   incidence, as shown by 80\% healthy tomato, compared with the other
   fertilizers. However, the organic fertilizers used did not give higher
   yields compared with chemical fertilizers. Sheep manure and chemical
   fertilizers led to the highest total tomato yield. Marketable yield was
   highest in poultry manures, of 16 t/ha, and lowest in chemical
   fertilizer, of 7 t/ha, 6 weeks after storage. The effect of aqueous
   extracts was not significant on either crop health or tomato yield and
   the results were inconsistent. The compost made of poultry manure
   therefore appears to be a promising ecological alternative to classical
   fertilizers.}},

Abstract = {{The performance, the degradability in soil and the environmental impact
   of biodegradable starch-based soil mulching and low tunnel films were
   assessed by means of field and laboratory tests. The lifetime of the
   biodegradable mulches was 9 months and of the biodegradable low-tunnel
   films 6 months. The radiometric properties of the biodegradable films
   influenced positively the microclimate: air temperature under the
   biodegradable low tunnel films was 2 degrees C higher than under the low
   density polyethylene films, resulting in an up to 20\% higher yield of
   strawberries. At the end of the cultivation period, the biodegradable
   mulches were broken up and buried in the field soil together with the
   plant residues. One year after burial, less than 4\% of the initial
   weight of the biodegradable film was found in the soil. According to
   ecotoxicity tests, the kinetic luminescent bacteria test with Vibrio
   fischeri and the Enchytraeus albidus ISO/CD 16387 reproduction
   potential, there was no evidence of ecotoxicity in the soil during the
   biodegradation process. Furthermore, there was no change in the
   diversity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in the soil determined on the
   basis of the appearance of amoA gene diversity in denaturing gradient
   gel electrophoresis.}},

Abstract = {{Over the ages, the deposits of dead vegetation buried by rock and
   mudflows, compacted and compressed out all of the moisture; it slowly
   carbonized and became coal.
   Humic acids are natural organic acids - brown coloured biological
   macromolecules, formed in coal by biochemical changes (decomposition,
   pyrolysis) of lignocellulosic matter.
   From lignite coal bed, the humates were extracted in alkaline medium and
   isolated from the residual fraction. Humic acids were obtained by
   treating humates' solutions with HCl.
   Thermal analysis (TG, DTG, DTA and DSC) was used in order to establish
   the decomposition and thermal effects of lignite, humates, humic acids
   and residual matter extracted from Rovinari mines in Romania. A
   non-isothermal linear temperature regime was imposed to reveal all
   decomposition steps.}},

Abstract = {{The extent of soil microbial diversity in agricultural soils is critical
   to the maintenance of soil health and quality. The aim of this study was
   to investigate the influence of land use intensification on soil
   microbial diversity and thus the level of soil suppressiveness of
   cucumber Fusarium wilt. We examined three typical microbial populations,
   Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Fuasarium oxysporum, and bacterial
   functional diversity in soils from three different land use types in
   China's Yangtze River Delta, and related those to suppressiveness of
   cucumber Fusarium wilt. The land use types were a traditional rice wheat
   (or rape) rotation land, an open field vegetable land, and a polytunnel
   greenhouse vegetable land that had been transformed from the above two
   land use types since 1995. Results generated from the field soils showed
   similar counts for Bacillus spp. (log 5.87-6.01 CFU g(-1) dw soil) among
   the three soils of different land use types, significantly lower counts
   for Pseudomonas spp. (log 5.44 CFU g(-1) dw soil) in the polytunnel
   greenhouse vegetable land whilst significantly lower counts for Fusarium
   oxysporum (log 3.21 CFU g(-1) dw soil) in the traditional rice wheat (or
   rape) rotation land. A significant lower dehydrogenase activity (33.56
   mg TPF kg(-1) dw day(-1)) was observed in the polytunnel greenhouse
   vegetable land. Community level physiological profiles (CLPP) of the
   bacterial communities in soils showed that the average well color
   development (AWCD) and three functional diversity indices of Shannon
   index (H'), Simpson index (D) and McIntosh index (U) at 96 h incubation
   in BIOLOG Eco Micro plates were significantly lower in the polytunnel
   greenhouse vegetable land than in both the traditional rice wheat (or
   rape) rotation land and the open field vegetable land. A further
   greenhouse experiment with the air-dried and sieved soils displayed
   significantly lower plant growth parameters of 10-old cucumber seedlings
   as well as significantly lower biomass and total fresh fruit yield at
   the end of harvesting at day 70 in the polytunnel greenhouse vegetable
   soil sources. The percentages of Fusarium wilt plant death were greatly
   increased in the polytunnel greenhouse vegetable plants, irrespective of
   being inoculated with or without Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum.
   Our results could provide a better understanding of the effects of land
   use intensification on soil microbial population and functional
   diversity as well as the level of soil suppressiveness of cucumber
   Fusarium wilt.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory and greenhouse experiments were conducted to study the
   effects of applications of rice residue and Pongamia pinnata and
   Azadirachta indica leaf litters on biochemical properties (extraction
   yield of humus, composition of humus, microbial biomass carbon,
   activities of urease and acid phosphatase) of a lowland rice soil under
   flooded conditions. Bulk soil sample collected from the Mandya paddy
   fields was used for the green house trials and the laboratory incubation
   studies. The organic materials were added at three rates - zero, 25.0 g
   carbon kg(-1) (2.5\% C) and 50.0 g carbon kg(-1) dry soil (5.0\% C).
   Results showed that tree leaf litter and rice residue at 5.0\% C rate
   decreased instantaneous decay constant (k), there by retarded the rate
   of C mineralization. Carbon contents of HA increased with the rate of C
   added. Study of delta-log K values and C contents of humic acids
   revealed that greatest molecular weight of HA was in the pongamia litter
   treatment, followed by neem litter and rice residue. Grain and straw
   yields of rice crop in the pot culture study were statistically
   correlated to the soil quality parameters. Neem and pongamia tree litter
   incorporation at 2.5\% C could be considered for improving soil health
   and crop yields of rice under flooded conditions; however, application
   at higher rates significantly (P <= 0.05) lowered total dry matter
   production in rice, despite favorable soil health parameters such as
   humic yields, microbial biomass - C content and acid phosphatase and
   urease activity. Among different soil health parameters, microbial
   quotient was found to be more sensitive indicator of decline in soil
   quality. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Zinc bioavailability in wheat grain in relation to phosphorus
   fertiliser, crop sequence and mycorrhizal fungi}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: While human diets are often deficient in zinc (Zn), the
   impacts of crop management on Zn in cereal grains are rarely examined.
   In this study the effect of phosphorus (P) fertiliser and crop sequence
   (wheat following canola, linola, fallow or pasture) on wheat grain Zn
   concentration and bioavailability for humans was investigated.
   RESULTS: The Zn concentration of wheat grain decreased by 33-39\% in
   response to P fertiliser. It was also 30-40\% lower for crops following
   canola and fallow than for those following linola and pasture. P
   fertiliser decreased the colonisation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   (AMF) in wheat roots, and canola and fallow led to lower colonisation
   than linola and pasture. Since AMF are known to assist in soil uptake of
   immobile nutrients such as Zn, it is hypothesised that P fertiliser and
   crop sequence affected grain Zn concentration through AMF. P fertiliser
   also increased the concentrations of grain P by 17\% and grain phytic
   acid (PA) by 19\%, but had little effect on the concentrations of
   calcium (Ca), iron (Fe) and polyphenols. Other impacts of crop sequence
   were slightly higher concentrations in grain of P after pasture and Fe
   after canola. The bioavailability of grain Zn, as shown by the PA:Zn and
   Ca x PA:Zn molar ratios, mostly reflected Zn concentration and was low
   in all treatments. After milling, the PA:Zn molar ratio suggested low Zn
   bioavailability for flour from wheat grown with P fertiliser after
   canola or fallow.
   CONCLUSION: Crop management can affect the bioavailability of Zn in
   wheat grain, with practices leading to high yields potentially leading
   to low Zn bioavailability. (C) 2008 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic C (SOC) pools under long-term management practices provide
   information on C sequestration pathways, soil quality maintenance, and
   crop productivity. Farmyard manure (FYM), paddy straw (PS), and green
   manure (GM) along with inorganic fertilizers were used in a 19-yr-old
   rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system in
   subtropical India to evaluate their impact on SOC stock, its different
   pools-total organic C (C-tot); oxidizable organic C (C-oc) and its four
   fractions of very labile (C-frac1), labile (C-frac2), less labile
   (C-frac3), and nonlabile C (C-frac4); microbial biomass C (C-mic); and
   mineralizable C (C-min). Cropping with only N-P-K fertilization just
   maintained SOC content, while N-P-K plus organics increased SOC by
   24.3\% over the control, their relative efficacy being FYM > PS > GM. A
   minimum of 3.56 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) was required to be added as organic
   amendments to compensate for SOC loss from cropping. The passive
   (C-frac3 + C-frac4) pool and C-min constituted about 39 and 11.5\%,
   respectively; of C-tot. Organics contributed toward the passive pool in
   the order FYM > PS > GM. Most of the pools were significantly (P =
   0.005) correlated with each other. Yield and sustainable yield index
   were strongly related with C-frac1, C-oc, C-mic, and C-min. Results
   suggest C-frac1 as a useful indicator for assessing soil health, and
   balanced fertilization with FYM as suitable management for sustaining
   crop productivity of the rice-wheat system.}},

   Enzyme activity is considered a sensitive indicator to evaluate soil
   health and the potential toxic impact of a soil contaminant.
   Nevertheless, there is heterogeneity in the responses from enzyme
   activity assays because of the influence of pH and other physicochemical
   parameters on both enzyme activity and metal speciation. This leads to
   complications when comparing soils and limits the validity of the
   results. To overcome these problems, this paper evaluates resistance and
   recovery, quantified by using a relative soil stability index (RSSI), of
   the beta-glucosidase and protease activities towards an additional heat
   disturbance (17 h at 60 degrees C) in soils where soil organic matter,
   pH and Cu content were modified in a factorial setup. Chemical analyses
   (dissolved Cu, pCu(2+), dissolved organic carbon, pH) were performed
   both before the heat-perturbation and after the enzyme activity
   monitoring period. Results show that soil pH did not interfere with the
   RSSI scores of both enzymes. beta-glucosiclase RSSI scores were scarcely
   affected by copper, making it inappropriate for evaluating
   copper-induced stress to soils. Protease activity shows stimulations of
   up to 2.5 times the activity of the unperturbed control in
   uncontaminated samples only. Thus, the protease RSSI score seems a good
   indicator for soil health relative to copper contamination given that
   all samples were affected by the presence of copper and high
   correlations were observed between RSSI scores and the different copper
   forms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to describe survival of Escherichia coli
   O157:H7 populations in manure-amended soils in terms of population
   stability, i.e. the temporal variation around the decline curve, in
   relation to soil characteristics indicative of soil health. Cow manure
   inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 was mixed with 18 pairs of organically
   and conventionally managed soils (10\% of manure, kg kg(-1)). For four
   of the soil pairs, also three different manure densities (5\%, 10\% and
   20\%) were compared. All soil-manure mixtures were incubated for 2
   months, and population densities of E. coli O157:H7 were quantified
   weekly. De-trending of survival data was done by modified logistic
   regression. The residual values were used to assess variation in the
   changes of E. coli O157:H7 populations by performing the approximate
   entropy (ApEn) procedure. The term irregularity is used to describe this
   variation in ApEn literature. On average, the decline of E. coli O157:H7
   was more irregular in conventional and loamy soils than in organic and
   sandy soils (P < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis of irregularity of
   E. coli O157:H7 survival on 13 soil characteristics showed a positive
   relation with the ratio of copiotrophic/oligotrophic bacteria,
   suggesting greater instability at higher available substrate
   concentrations. Incremental rates of manure application significantly
   changed the irregularity for conventional soils only. Estimation of
   temporal variation of enteropathogen populations by the ApEn procedure
   can increase the accuracy of predicted survival time and may form an
   important indication for soil health.}},

Abstract = {{If benefits of conservation tillage can be quantified even in the
   transition year from conventional tillage, growers will more likely
   integrate practices that maintain or enhance soil quality and
   productivity. The management of surface residue is an important
   component of conservation tillage, especially in cool, rainy climates
   where vegetable growth and yield reductions have been observed when
   heavy residue is present. Cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), grown until
   flowering, was killed with glyphosate and was then cut and removed
   (stubble treatment) or rolled or chopped to form a surface mulch
   (mulched treatment) before transplanting cabbage. Rolled mulch increased
   soil wet aggregate stability by 4\% and reduced soil penetrometer
   resistance by up to 0.5 MPa compared with rye stubble treatments in
   2003. In 2004, frequent rains saturated soils and may have accelerated
   the decomposition of chopped mulch, minimizing treatment effects. Rolled
   mulch reduced soil temperatures by tip to 2 degrees C in 2003, but June
   transplanting of cabbage probably minimized the impact of soil
   temperature. Mulched treatments did not delay cabbage maturity or affect
   head quality characteristics such as color or uniformity. Although
   rolled mulch reduced cabbage growth by as much as 30\% and yield by 21\%
   in 2003, chopped mulch did not affect growth or yield in 2004. Yield
   reduction may be overcome by killing the rye relatively early in the
   spring or retaining only the surface stubble; these strategies may
   maintain or measurably improve soil quality even in the transition year
   to conservation tillage.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality and health are terms describing similar concepts, but the
   latter appeals to farmers and crop consultants as part of a holistic
   approach to soil management. We regard soil health as the integration
   and optimization of the physical, biological and chemical aspects of
   soils for improved productivity in an economic and sustainable manner.
   This paper describes the process used for the selection of soil
   quality/health indicators that comprise the new Cornell Soil Health
   Test. Over 1,500 samples collected from controlled research experiments
   and commercial farms were initially analyzed for 39 potential soil
   quality indicators. Four physical and four biological indicators were
   selected based on sensitivity to management, relevance to functional
   soil processes, ease and cost of sampling, and cost of analysis. Seven
   chemical indicators were also selected as they are part of the standard
   soil nutrient test. Soil health test reports were developed to allow for
   an overall assessment, as well as the identification of specific soil
   constraints. The new soil health test is being offered on a for-fee
   basis starting in 2007. In addition, visible near infrared reflectance
   spectroscopy was evaluated as a possible tool for low-cost soil health
   assessment. From preliminary analyses, the methodology shows promise for
   some but not all of the soil quality indicators. In conclusion, an
   inexpensive soil health test was developed for integrative assessment of
   the physical, biological, and chemical aspects of soils, thereby
   facilitating better soil management.}},

Abstract = {{Idowu et al., in this edition of Plant and Soil describe a welcome new
   tool that allows farmers to optimize the management of their fields. It
   is based on a holistic approach that integrates assays of soil physical,
   chemical and biological parameters into an easily understandable,
   low-cost and quantitative estimate of soil quality or ``health{''}. It
   can facilitate tracking and understanding of the short and long term
   effects of different management approaches on soil (and crop) health.
   Most of the assays used are based on traditional, labour-intensive
   techniques. The tool could be improved through employment of assay
   technologies that are under development. For example, Idowu et al., in
   this edition investigated the use of near infra-red spectroscopy as a
   replacement for some of the traditional soil assays. Similarly, future
   developments in remote spectroscopic assays, using satellite, airborne
   or land-based platforms may facilitate further improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality assessment has been recognized as an important step toward
   understanding the long-term effects of conservation practices within
   agricultural watersheds. Our objective was to assess soil quality within
   the South Fork watershed of the Iowa River using various indicators and
   assessment approaches. Soil samples were collected during 2003 and 2004
   from 29 areas of 32 ha (80 acres) each along two transects traversing
   the watershed. Soil pH, Mehlich III extractable P, K, Ca and Mg,
   electrical conductivity (EC), total organic carbon (TOC), and total N
   (TN) were measured. The Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) was
   used to compute a soil quality index (SQI), while soil loss, the soil
   tillage intensity rating (STIR), N-leaching potential, and soil
   conditioning index (SCI) were determined for each sampling area using
   the 2003 version of the Revised Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE2). Overall,
   there were no soil fertility limitations within the watershed based on
   an average pH of 6.96 and extractable P and K levels of 36 and 162 mg
   kg(-1), respectively. Soil loss,STIR, N-leaching,and SCI averaged 1.13
   Mg ha(-1), 68,3, and 0.4, respectively. The SMAY analysis indicated
   soils within the watershed were functioning at 87\% of their full
   potential. The lowest indicator score was associated with TOC (0.60)
   because the average value was only 28.4 g kg(-1). The SCI and SQI
   indices were positively correlated although since it used measured data,
   the SMAF appears to provide more information about the effects of
   management practices within the watershed. Soils in upper landscape
   positions had lower TOC and C:N ratios indicating an increased risks for
   both erosion and for nitrate leaching. Management of soils on hilltops
   may be the most effective way to minimize N and P losses within the
   watershed. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Transcriptome profiling of developmental and xenobiotic responses in a

Abstract = {{Background: Natural contamination and anthropogenic pollution of soils
   are likely to be major determinants of functioning and survival of
   keystone invertebrate taxa. Soil animals will have both evolutionary
   adaptation and genetically programmed responses to these toxic
   chemicals, but mechanistic understanding of such is sparse. The
   clitellate annelid Lumbricus rubellus is a model organism for soil
   health testing, but genetic data have been lacking.
   Results: We generated a 17,000 sequence expressed sequence tag dataset,
   defining similar to 8,100 different putative genes, and built an
   8,000-element transcriptome microarray for L. rubellus. Strikingly, less
   than half the putative genes (43\%) were assigned annotations from the
   gene ontology (GO) system; this reflects the phylogenetic uniqueness of
   earthworms compared to the well-annotated model animals. The microarray
   was used to identify adult- and juvenile-specific transcript profiles in
   untreated animals and to determine dose-response transcription profiles
   following exposure to three xenobiotics from different chemical classes:
   inorganic (the metal cadmium), organic (the polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbon fluoranthene), and agrochemical (the herbicide atrazine).
   Analysis of these profiles revealed compound-specific fingerprints which
   identify the molecular responses of this annelid to each contaminant.
   The data and analyses are available in an integrated database,
   LumbriBASE.
   Conclusion: L. rubellus has a complex response to contaminant exposure,
   but this can be efficiently analysed using molecular methods, revealing
   unique response profiles for different classes of effector. These
   profiles may assist in the development of novel monitoring or
   bioremediation protocols, as well as in understanding the ecosystem
   effects of exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous phytoextraction has lately drawn a lot of attention due to
   its potential for the remediation of metal polluted soils. Although when
   assessing the success of a phytoextraction process, up till now,
   emphasis has mostly been placed on metal removal, it is important to
   highlight that the ultimate objective of a phytoextraction process must
   be to restore soil health. Consequently, a short-term microcosm study
   was carried out to evaluate the capacity of an actively growing ecotype
   of the Zn and Cd hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens (Lanestosa
   ecotype) to phytoextract metals from soil and, above all, to assess the
   potential of soil functional diversity (through the determination of
   soil enzyme activities and community level physiological profiles) to
   both determine the toxic effect of metals on soil condition and to
   monitor the efficiency of a metal phytoextraction process. T.
   caerulescens plants grown in metal polluted soils showed a shoot metal
   concentration of 337 mg of Cd, 5670 mg of Zn and 76.6 mg of Pb per kg of
   dry weight tissue. Apart from confirming its great potential for Zn and
   Cd phytoextraction, the presence of T. caerulescens, as compared to the
   metal phytoextraction itself, had the major effect on soil biological
   parameters. Actually, in metal polluted soils, the presence of T.
   caerulescens led to a 154, 115, 140, 37 and 164\% increase in the
   activity of beta-glucosidase, arylsulphatase, acid phosphatase, alkaline
   phosphatase and urease, respectively. Metal pollution did not cause a
   clear inhibition of soil enzyme activities. Contrasting results were
   obtained with EcoPlates (TM) versus soil enzyme activities. Actually,
   the presence of metals led to significantly lower values of Shannon's
   index calculated from enzyme activities and non-significant higher
   values of this same index when calculated from EcoPlates (TM) data. It
   was concluded that biological indicators of soil health are valid tools
   to evaluate the success of a metal phytoextraction process. (C) 2008

   rhizoplane-RP) affected the composition of microbial communities. Sample
   from conventional management showed a higher Pseudomonas diversity
   (H'=3.7) than that from raised bed (H'=2.78). However, total bacterial
   diversity (SSCP data) was more complex in rb than pf management.
   Dominant members of both pf and rb were gamma-proteobacteria as
   Pseudomonas was dominant over other forms, while Bacillus species were
   only present as low numbers in rb.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires are the main disturbance in the Mediterranean basin,
   exerting both immediate and lasting ecological and environmental
   impacts. This is in part caused by transformation of the quality and
   quantity of organic matter (OM), which is reflected in the structure of
   the whole system and negatively affects soil health and quality, also
   favouring the occurrence of erosion processes. However, the effects of
   fire on soil colloidal properties are reversible. Thus, the main
   objective of this work was the identification of proxies for the
   recovery of soils affected by forest fires. This was approached using a
   cross disciplinary and comparative study of fire-affected and
   non-affected soils at different timescales chosen from a variety of
   scenarios from Andalusia (Southern Spain). Changes in soil fractions and
   forms of OM were studied using different analytical techniques {[}gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), pyrolysis (Py)-GC/MS and solid
   state (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)]. Among the main results is
   the detection of markets from the analysis of thermo-evaporation
   products, mainly furan derivatives, released from whole soil samples
   using sub-pyrolysis temperatures. Shifts in fatty acid patterns and
   other families of pyrolysis products from soil were observed using
   conventional Py-GC/MS. Extracted soil lipids were also a valid proxy and
   differences were found in the distribution pattern of certain aliphatic
   series and terpenes. Other chemical modifications were also observed
   after fire, and 13 C NMR analysis suggests an enrichment in aromatic
   structures in fire-affected soils. These differential characteristics
   could be used as markets for monitoring the recovery of soils after
   wildfire events. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization has drastically changed soil properties, and an assessment

   activities of urease, acid phosphatase, invertase and catalase, soil
   organic matter, pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and clay (< 0.01 mm)
   content of urban soils under two land-uses in the central built-up area
   of the Shenzhen city were investigated, and multivariate analysis was
   used to study the relationship between soil enzymes and soil
   physical-chemical properties. The results showed that invertase activity
   in roadside soil was significantly higher than that in urban park soil,
   whereas catalase activity was significantly higher in urban park soil.
   Soil organic matter had significant positive correlation with activities
   of invertase, urease and acid phosphatase but not with catalase. Soil pH
   had a significant negative direct effect on urease and acid phosphatase
   activity, but the effect was counteracted by positive indirect effect of
   soil organic matter. Soil EC had a positive direct effect on activities
   of catalase and there was a significant correlation between soil EC and

Abstract = {{Trophic groups and functional guilds of soil nematodes were measured
   under four mine tailing subsystems in the Baoshan lead/zinc mine, Hunan
   Province, southern China to test the indicator value of nematodes for
   heavy metal pollution. No obvious correlation was found between heavy
   metal concentration and the total number of nematodes. However, the
   densities of c-p3, c-p4 and c-p5 nematodes were negatively correlated
   with Pb and Zn concentrations, suggesting that the abundance of nematode
   groups of high c-p values is useful indicators of heavy metal
   contamination. The ``weighted faunal analysis{''} provided a better
   assessment of soil health condition than Maturity Index (MI) in
   situations where there were extremely low numbers of soil nematodes.
   Results showed that the effect of heavy metal contamination on soil
   nematodes might be strongly influenced by plants. Although the abundance
   of plant-feeding nematodes did not reflect the heavy metal conditions in
   the soil, it might be used as an index for assessing the soil
   remediation potential of pioneering plants. Patrinia villosa seems
   superior to Viola baoshanensis as a pioneer plant species for soil
   remediation based on analysis of rhizosphere nematode community. (C)

Abstract = {{To improve the sustainability and environmental accountability of the
   banana industry there is a need to develop a set of soil health
   indicators that integrate physical, chemical and biological soil
   properties. These indicators would allow banana growers, extension and
   research workers to improve soil health management practices. To
   determine changes in soil properties due to the cultivation of bananas,
   a paired site survey was conducted comparing soil properties under
   conventional banana systems to less intensively managed vegetation
   systems, such as pastures and forest. Measurements were made on
   physical, chemical and biological soil properties at seven locations in
   tropical and sub-tropical banana producing areas. Soil nematode
   community composition was used as a bioindicator of the biological
   properties of the soil. Soils under conventional banana production
   tended to have a greater soil bulk density, with less soil organic
   carbon (C) (both total C and labile C), greater exchangeable cations,
   higher extractable P, greater numbers of plant-parasitic nematodes and
   less nematode diversity, relative to less intensively managed plant
   systems. The organic banana production systems at two locations had
   greater labile C, relative to conventional banana systems, but there was
   no significant change in nematode community composition. There were
   significant interactions between physical, chemical and nematode
   community measurements in the soil, particularly with soil C
   measurements, confirming the need for a holistic set of indicators to
   aid soil management. There was no single indicator of soil health for
   the Australian banana industry, but a set of soil health indicators,
   which would allow the measurement of soil improvements should include:
   bulk density, soil C, pH, EC, total N, extractable P, ECEC and soil
   nematode community structure. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by

Abstract = {{Microorganisms play a critical role in nutrient transformation, soil
   health and for sustaining the productivity of soils. Effects of
   long-term cropping, fertilization, manuring and their integration on
   microbial community were studied in soil samples from five long-term
   fertilizer experiments under various rainfed production systems in the
   semi-arid tropics (SAT) of India. Microbial population counts were
   analyzed by dilution plating and were in turn compared with different
   parameters such as soil treatments, soil type, soil microbial biomass C,
   soil organic C, rainfall and soil pH. The counts were high in treatments
   where combinations of organic and inorganic fertilizers were applied
   compared to control. Vertisols showed larger organic carbon levels than
   Alfisols. Fungal population was higher in acidic soils and in treatments
   under continuous inorganic fertilization treatments whereas a high
   number of bacteria were found in integrated use of organic and inorganic
   fertilizers, At most of the locations soil organic C and microbial
   biomass C showed significant positive (p <= 0.05) correlation with
   microbial populations. Thus, results suggest that even under and and
   semi-arid tropical conditions, regular addition of nutrients in an
   integrated manner could improve soil organic carbon and microbial
   population counts. For each production system, better carbon
   sequestration management practices were identified. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To explore long-term impact of organic and inorganic fertilizers on soil
   health and grain quality, we monitored the enzyme activities and
   chemical properties of soil; and chemical composition of grain from
   eight treatments at an experimental field site established in 1996.
   There were eight treatments applied to both wheat and maize seasons: a
   control; four inorganic fertilizers, that is, nitrogen and phosphorus
   (NP), nitrogen and potassium (NK), phosphorous and potassium (PK) and
   nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK); farm yard manure alone (FYM)
   and addition of FYM at two different doses (100 and 50\% of
   recommendation) to NPK that is, NPK + FYM and (1)/(2) NPK + FYM. After
   11 years of the experiment the NPK + FYM and (1)/(2) NPK + FYM
   treatments had the highest yields, about 5 Mg maize ha (1) and 2 Mg
   wheat ha (1) with about 2 and 0.5 Mg ha(-1), respectively more than the
   NPK treatments. The dehydrogeanse activity of soils increased
   significantly in FYM and (1)/(2) NPK + FYM. Except urease all other
   enzymatic activities were increased in those treatments, which received
   manure. Urease activity was higher in mineral-N applied plots. Grain
   protein content of both maize and wheat was highest in mineral
   fertilized plots. Test weight also increased significantly on
   application of mineral fertilizer. Plots treated with half dose of
   recommended mineral fertilizer along with FYM were higher in urease,
   phosphomono and diesterase activities than that of NPK + FYM treated
   plots. Long-term application of inorganic nutrients along with FYM
   improved grain mineral composition and yield. Inhibition of few
   enzymatic activities were also observed upon application of inorganic
   nutrients either alone or in combination. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract = {{Understanding the processes of soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation or
   depletion under different management strategies is vital for maintaining
   soil health and curbing global warming. Using a 36-year-old fertility
   experiment under subtropical climate, we investigated the impact of
   long-term intensive rice-rice cropping system with different managements
   on the SOC stock. The mechanistic pathway of stabilization of the SOC
   into different pools, with a tentative C budgeting was also established.
   Biochemical composition of the organic residues involved, SOC pools of
   different oxidizability and methane (CH4) emission were estimated for
   the experiment conducted using organic and inorganic sources of
   nutrients. Cultivation over the years caused a net decrease in SOC
   stocks but with balanced fertilization it increased. With increasing
   depth, the stock decreased on average, to the extent of 50\%, 26\% and
   24\% of the total at 0-0.2, 0.2-0.4 and 0.4-0.6 m, respectively. About
   4.0\% of the crop residues C incorporated into the soil were stabilized
   into SOC. This was further enhanced (1.6 times) by the application of
   compost. Carbon loss through CH4 emission was very low (2.6\% of the
   total). `Summer fallow' had a positive significant influence on C loss
   from the system. As much as 29\% of the compost C added to the soil was
   stabilized into SOC mostly in the less-labile or nonlabile recalcitrant
   pools preferentially in the surface layer of the soil. Large polyphenol
   and lignin contents of crop residues including compost, and the long
   period of soil submergence under rice cultivation might have conferred
   recalcitrant character to the SOC leading to its stabilization in
   nonlabile pools. This would result into an enrichment of the SOC stock
   and restriction to the gaseous C loading into the atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary salinisation is the most harmful and extended phenomenon of
   the unfavourable effects of irrigation on the soil and environment. An
   attempt was made to study the impact of poor quality ground water on
   soils in terms of secondary salinisation and availability of soil
   nutrients in Faridkot district of Punjab of northern India. Based on
   physiographic analysis of IRS 1C LISS-III data and semi-detailed soil
   survey, the soil map was finalized on a 1:50,000 scale and digitized
   using Arc Info GIS. Georeferenced surface soil samples (0-0.15 m) from
   231 sites were collected and analyzed for available phosphorus (P) and
   potassium (K). Interpolation by kriging produced digital spatial maps of
   available P and K. Ground water quality map was generated in GIS domain
   on the basis of EC (electrical conductivity) and RSC (residual sodium
   carbonate) of ground water samples collected from 374 georeferenced tube
   wells. Integration of soil and ground water quality maps enabled
   generating a map showing degree (high, moderate and low) and type
   (salinity, sodicity and both) of vulnerability to secondary
   salinization. Fine-textured soils have been found to be highly sensitive
   to secondary salinisation, whereas medium-textured soils as moderately
   sensitive to secondary salinisation. The resultant map was integrated
   with available P and K maps to show the combined influence of soil
   texture and ground water quality on available soil nutrients. The
   results show that available P and K in the soils of different
   physiographic units were found in the order of Ap1 < Ap2 < Ap3. The
   soils of all physiographic units had sizeable area having high content
   of P (> 22.5 kg / ha) and medium available K (135-335 kg ha(-1)) in most
   of the test sites when irrigated with saline, sodic or poor quality
   water.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of repeated applications of chlorpyrifos on its persistence and
   soil microbial functional diversity were studied under laboratory
   conditions. The results showed that the degradation rate of chlorpyrifos
   increased whereas its inhibitory effect on soil microbial communities
   gradually decreased with application frequency of chlorpyrifos. A
   bacterial strain DSP capable of utilizing chlorpyrifos as a sole source
   of carbon and energy was isolated 21 days after the third chlorpyrifos
   application, which indicated that the capability of soil microorganism
   for degrading chlorpyrifos was formed during the experiment. It could be
   concluded that repeated applications of chlorpyrifos had no lasting
   impact on soil health.}},

Abstract = {{Enormous quantity of water is used for coal beneficiation and
   accordingly huge amount of effluents are being generated. In this study
   an attempt was made to evaluate the potential of this effluent water for
   irrigation. Water samples were collected from three different points (a)
   feeding point, (b) thickening point, and (c) outlet point of coal
   washery, and from Damodar River for monitoring the water quality. The
   samples were analyzed for various parameters and compared with
   prescribed standard, which revealed that the total suspended solids of
   thickening point and Damodar River were higher. A pot experiment with
   maize was conducted to study the suitability of this coal washery water
   for irrigation. Pots were irrigated with water from the three points of
   washery and Damodar River in two concentrations (100\% and 50\% dilution
   with distilled water); pure distilled water was used for control. There
   was 100\% germination in all the treatments. The plant growth,
   chlorophyll content and soil quality parameters were significantly
   better in washery and Damodar River water treated pots. The Damodar
   River water and washery water from feeding and outlet point could be
   successfully used for irrigation. In general mixing with good quality
   water has shown better results.}},

Abstract = {{A long-term field experiment was conducted at the Qu-Zhou experimental
   station, China Agricultural University to study how the nematode
   community structure was influenced by compost and chemical fertilizer;
   using no amendment as the control. Soil samples were; collected from
   0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depths. The different treatments led to a
   significant. difference in the total number of nematodes, bacterivores,
   plant parasites, omnivores-predators and nematode richness. The total
   number of nematodes, bacterivores, omnivores-predators and nematode.
   richness were found to decrease in chemical fertilizer-treated plots.
   Although plant parasites were more abundant under compost treatment than
   under chemical fertilization, the relative abundance of plant parasites
   in the compost-treated plots was smaller. The application of chemical
   fertilizer decreased the number of genera of bacterivores and
   omnivores-predators. The numbers of total nematodes, bacterivores, plant
   parasites and omnivores-predators were significantly positively
   correlated with the contents of total organic carbon, total N,
   alkali-hydrolysable N, available P and available K. The compost-treated
   plots tended to have a greater diversity of nematodes than chemical
   fertilizer treated plots, so there was a healthy soil ecosystem under

Abstract = {{Low native soil nitrogen (N) and very low phosphorus (P) coupled with
   apathy of farmers towards use of fertilizer are the major constraints
   limiting rice productivity in the North Eastern Hill (NEH) Region of
   India. Field experiment was undertaken in narrow valley wetland during
   Kharif and pre-Kharif (rainy) seasons of 2003, 2004, and 2005,
   respectively, at Umiam (950 m MSL), Meghalaya to evaluate the nutrient
   recycling and production potential of rice (Oryza sativa L.)-vegetables
   cropping sequences under low input in situ residue management under
   rainfed conditions. After rice, five vegetable crops, viz. tomato
   (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.),
   frenchbean (Phaseolus vulgaris), cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var.
   capitata), and carrot (Daucas carota L.) were grown during pre-kharif
   season on temporary raised and sunken beds. Minimum tillage was given to
   both rice and vegetables. No external input including fertilizer,
   organic manure, pesticides, etc. were applied to either crops. Only the
   economic parts of the crops were harvested and the rest of the biomass
   of the entire crop and weed residues were chopped and incorporated into
   the soil. Among the five cropping sequences, rice-tomato gave the
   highest rice equivalent yield (214.40 q/ha), followed by rice-carrot
   (206.4 q/ha). Highest net return (rupees {[}Rs.] 66,635 ha(-1)) was
   recorded in rice-carrot, closely followed by rice-tomato (Rs. 66,139
   ha(-1)). Rice-cabbage and rice-frenchbean were found to be on a par with
   each other in terms of yield and income. The highest amount of NPK
   recycling was recorded for the rice-potato sequence. Weed biomass
   production in the different sequences ranged from 37.5 q/ha for
   rice-tomato to as high as 50.6 q/ha in the case of rice-fallow. Soil
   fertility in terms of available NPK status was found to be stable in all
   the crop sequences except rice-cabbage, where fertility status declined
   slightly. The soil biological properties such as population of
   Rhizobium, bacteria, phosphorus-solubilizing microorganisms, and
   earthworm activity were all found to be remarkably higher in the
   experimental field compared to other adjacent plots that are managed
   inorganically. It was concluded that vegetables such as tomato, carrot,
   potato, etc. could be profitably grown after rice without the addition
   of fertilizer and manure, if residues are managed effectively under
   temporary raised beds without deteriorating soil fertility.}},

Abstract = {{A fixed plot field study was carried out during 2001-02 to 2005-06 at
   experimental Farm, Almora, to study the effect of tillage and irrigation
   on productivity, profitability, and soil health in rice (Oryza sativa
   L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend Fiori \& Paol) system.
   Significantly higher net returns, net returns/mm applied water was found
   in zero tillage than the conventional tillage. The rice grain yield did
   not differ significantly due to tillage, however, mean wheat yield was
   higher in conventional tillage than the zero tillage. On pooled basis
   significantly higher yield in terms of rice equivalent was recorded in
   conventional tillage than zero tillage. The grain yield enhanced by 8.3,
   14.0 and 16.5\% in rice, 21.2, 33.8 and 46.8\% in wheat due to
   irrigation at pre-sowing + active tillering/crown root-initiation,
   presowing + active tillering/crown root-initiation + flowering,
   pre-sowing + active tillering/crown root-initiation + flowering +
   grain-filling stages respectively over pre-sowing. Similarly, system
   productivity, gross as well as net returns and benefit: cost ratio
   increased significantly due to increased number of irrigation. Zero
   tillage recorded higher organic carbon and lower bulk density than
   conventional tillage. This trend was similar with increasing number of
   irrigations also.}},

Abstract = {{Approaches to measuring air and water quality are well established, but
   soil quality assessment protocols to be used in landscape monitoring
   efforts are largely non-existent. The concept of soil quality represents
   the integration of the physical, biological, and chemical aspects of
   soils. Limited attention has been given to the holistic assessment of
   soil quality in landscape and urban planning, as it is typically
   addressed only through chemical analyses. We describe the process used
   for the selection of soil quality indicators that are being offered as
   part of the new Cornell Soil Health Test. Over 1500 samples were
   collected from agricultural landscapes, including controlled
   experiments, and analyzed for 39 potential soil quality indicators. Four
   physical and four biological soil indicators were selected based on
   sensitivity to management, relevance to functional soil processes, ease
   and cost of sampling, and cost of analysis. Seven chemical indicators
   were selected as they constitute the standard soil fertility test. For
   potentially contaminated sites, additional chemical indicators were
   considered through a total elemental analysis. Test reports were
   developed to allow for overall soil quality assessment and the
   identification of specific soil constraints that may be remedied through
   management practices. The use of the new soil quality test is
   exemplified for three landscape scenarios in New York State: a vegetable
   farm, a town park, and a vacant urban lot. The protocol provides a
   comprehensive assessment of the soil's ability to perform critical
   environmental functions at a relatively modest cost, and it helps target
   management and remediation approaches. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Pesticides are extensively used in agriculture as a part of pest control
   strategies. Owing to their xenobiotics characteristics, pesticides may
   adversely affect the proliferation of beneficial soil microorganisms and
   their associated biotransformation in the soil. Inactivation of
   nitrogen-fixing and phosphorus-solubilizing microorganisms is observed
   in pesticide-contaminated soils. Recent studies show that some
   pesticides disturb molecular interactions between plants and N-fixing
   rhizobacteria and consequently inhibit the vital process of biological
   nitrogen fixation. Similarly, many studies show that pesticides reduce
   activities of soil enzymes that are key indicators of soil health. The
   applied pesticides may also influence many biochemical reactions such as
   mineralization of organic matter, nitrification, denitrification,
   ammonification, redox reactions, methanogenesis, etc. However, a few
   reports reveal some positive effects of applied pesticides on soil
   health. In this chapter, we attempt to analyze the impacts of pesticides
   on soil microbial communities, soil biochemical reactions, and soil
   enzymes.}},

Abstract = {{The establishment of enclosures has become an important measure to
   combat land degradation in many of the world's semi-arid rangelands. in
   view of the increased pressure exerted by this land reclamation strategy
   on the neighbouring agricultural lands, knowledge of the time required
   for restoring vegetation cover and soil health, and of the potential
   positive impact of an adapted management strategy, is highly required.
   This paper assesses the vegetation and soil rehabilitation in a 23-year
   chronosequence of two different enclosure management types. In the
   severely degraded, semi-arid Njemps Flats plain of the Lake Baringo
   Basin in Kenya communal enclosures characterised by high quality inputs
   and strict control, and private enclosures managed by individual
   farmers, were installed since the 1980s. Six communal enclosures (3-17
   years since establishment) and six private enclosures (13-23 years since
   establishment) were selected. Vegetation cover was estimated along three
   50 m transects set within each enclosure and in the adjacent open
   grazing area using the point-to-line transect method. Five 0.5 m(2)
   quadrats systematically placed alongside each transect were sampled for
   herbaceous standing biomass and topsoil physical, chemical and
   biological analyses. Grass cover and herbaceous biomass production
   proved to be the most responsive biotic parameters under both management
   types, whereas the recovery of the forbs was unsuccessful. Under
   communal management, the biomass production fully recovered up to its
   optimal level as recorded in the neighbouring nature reserves. Within
   private enclosures however, the adopted management strategies seriously
   restricted biomass production to a significantly lower level. Soil
   quality generally recovered more slowly with time. Significant
   improvements compared to the open rangeland were recorded in topsoil
   bulk density, organic C and total N stocks, and microbial biomass C and
   N stocks of the communal enclosures. Unlike the communal enclosures,
   only topsoil bulk density and the microbial biomass C stock showed a
   significant difference in the private enclosures. With respect to C and
   total N stocks, and the microbial biomass N a non-significant improving
   trend was recorded. The level of chemical and biological soil quality
   obtained under both management types is still low and draws the
   attention to the importance of careful monitoring of grazing and grass
   cutting activities under both enclosure management strategies. The
   chronosequences further highlight the potential of some well-managed
   private enclosures, whereas intrinsic soil properties such as high
   alkalinity, as well as changes in management, limit the rehabilitation
   of some other private as well as communal enclosures. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An ecological approach was used to investigate the relationship between
   diversity of soil fungal communities and soil-borne pathogen inoculum in
   a potato growing area of northern Italy affected by yield decline. The
   study was performed in 14 sites with the same tillage management
   practices: 10 named `potato sites', that for many years had been
   intensely cultivated with potatoes, and 4 named `rotation sites',
   subject to a 4-year rotation without potatoes or any recurrent crop for
   many years. Fungal communities were recorded using conventional (soil
   fungi by plate count and endophytic fungi as infection frequency on
   pot-grown potato plant roots in soil samples) and molecular approaches
   {[}Basidiomycetes and Ascomycetes with specific and denaturing gradient
   gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis]. Diversity of fungal communities in
   potato sites was significantly lower than that in rotation sites. In
   addition, fungal communities in rotation sites showed lower
   Berger-Parker dominance than those in the potato sites, suggesting that
   rotation sites had a higher diversity as well as a better fungal
   community balance than potato sites. The ANalysis Of SIMilarity test of
   soil fungi and root endophytic fungi revealed that the two cropping
   systems differed significantly for species composition. Root endophytic
   fungal communities showed a greater ability to colonise potato roots in
   soil samples from potato sites than those from rotation sites. Moreover,
   the majority of endophytic root fungal community species in potato sites
   belonged to the potato root rot complex and storage disease
   (Colletotrichum coccodes, Fusarium solani and Fusarium oxysporum), while
   those in rotation sites were mainly ubiquitous or saprobic fungi. Soil
   rDNA analyses showed that Ascomycetes were much more frequent than
   Basidiomycetes in all the soils examined. DGGE analysis, with the
   Ascomycete-specific primer (ITS1F/ITS4A), did not reveal distinctions
   between the communities found at the potato and rotation sites, although
   the same analysis showed differences between the communities of
   Basidiomycetes (specific primer ITS1F/ITS4B). These findings showed that
   recurrent potato cropping affected diversity and composition of soil
   fungal communities and induced a shift in specialisation of the
   endophytic fungi towards potato.}},

Abstract = {{Observations on the etiology of rhizome rot of ginger are presented for
   Fiji and Australia. In Fiji, the disease generally develops during hot,
   wet conditions in March and April, and often causes losses of more than
   50\% in seed crops. In Australia, the disease was observed for the first
   time during the wet summer of 2007-08, almost totally destroying the
   immature ginger crop in one field and causing 8-30\% losses in other
   fields. Measurements taken when soils were saturated due to almost
   constant rainfall indicated that many plants died within 3 weeks of
   showing the first signs of yellowing, with the disease spreading down
   slopes at rates of up to 4.5 m/day. Pathogenicity tests indicated that
   the disease was caused by Pythium myriotylum and that the pathogen was
   capable of destroying ginger rhizomes in 1-2 weeks in saturated soils at
   temperatures of 26-30 degrees C. The role of the environment in
   exacerbating the disease is considered and implications for management
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{`Soil health' programs and projects in Australia's agricultural
   districts are designed to influence farmers' management behaviours,
   usually to produce better outcomes for production, conservation, and
   sustainability. These programs usually examine soil management practices
   from a soil science perspective, but how soils are understood by
   farmers, and how that understanding informs their farm management
   decisions, is poorly documented. The research presented in this paper
   sought to better understand how dryland farmers in the Billabong
   catchment of southern New South Wales use soil indicators to inform
   their management decisions. Thematic content analysis of transcripts of
   semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with farmers suggest several
   themes that have implications for soil scientists and other
   professionals wishing to promote soil health in the dryland farming
   regions of south-eastern Australia. In particular, all soil indicators,
   including those related to soil `health', need to relate to some clear,
   practical use to farmers if they are to be used in farm decision making.
   This research highlights a reliance of the participants of this research
   on agronomists. Reliance on agronomists for soil management decisions
   may result in increasing loss of connectivity between farmers and their
   land. If this reflects a wider trend, soil health projects may need to
   consider where best to direct their capacity-building activities, and/or
   how to re-empower individual farmers.}},

Abstract = {{`Soil health' programs and projects in Australia's agricultural
   districts are designed to influence farmers' management behaviours,
   usually to produce better outcomes for production, conservation, and
   sustainability. These programs usually examine soil management practices
   from a soil science perspective, but how soils are understood by
   farmers, and how that understanding informs their farm management
   decisions, is poorly documented. The research presented in this paper
   sought to better understand how dryland farmers in the Billabong
   catchment of southern New South Wales use soil indicators to inform
   their management decisions. Thematic content analysis of transcripts of
   semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with farmers suggest several
   themes that have implications for soil scientists and other
   professionals wishing to promote soil health in the dryland farming
   regions of south-eastern Australia. In particular, all soil indicators,
   including those related to soil `health', need to relate to some clear,
   practical use to farmers if they are to be used in farm decision making.
   This research highlights a reliance of the participants of this research
   on agronomists. Reliance on agronomists for soil management decisions
   may result in increasing loss of connectivity between farmers and their
   land. If this reflects a wider trend, soil health projects may need to
   consider where best to direct their capacity-building activities, and/or
   how to re-empower individual farmers.}},

Abstract = {{The root-lesion nematode Pratylenchus penetrans is a pathogen of red
   raspberry (Rubus idaeus). A field experiment was initiated in 2003 to
   determine the effects of organic mulches of two different composts,
   broiler manure, and shredded paper co-applied with broiler manure, on
   (i) the abundance of P. penetrans, (ii) free-living nematodes as
   indicators of soil food web structure, and (iii) root biomass and early
   productivity of `Malahat' red raspberry. The organic mulches were
   applied each year at rates estimated to provide the 1.5 m wide root zone
   strip with approximately 133 kg.ha(-1) of potentially available
   nitrogen. The nonmulched control was fertilized each year with urea at
   133 kg N.ha(-1). Soil samples were taken from the root zone for root
   biomass and nematode analyses at five dates during the 2005 and 2006
   growing seasons. Population densities of P. penetrans in soil were lower
   and root biomass was greater under one of the composts and the shredded
   paper - broiler manure mulch relative to the nonmulched treatment. Fine
   root biomass was negatively correlated with P. penetrans per gram root.
   The abundance of omnivorous and predacious nematodes was negatively
   correlated with P. penetrans population densities and positively
   correlated with root biomass. The data are consistent with our
   hypothesis that organic mulches increase soil food web structure and the
   abundance of nematode antagonists (e.g., predacious nematodes),
   resulting in reduced crop damage by P. penetrans. However, we cannot
   rule out the possibility that the improved raspberry root growth and
   primocane productivity was the result of beneficial changes in soil
   chemical properties, such as increases in exchangeable calcium and pH.}},

Abstract = {{Amazonas State is the largest state in Brazil and mainly covered by
   tropical forest. Because of the importance of the tropical forest in
   maintaining soil health and a clean environment, conservation of the
   Amazon forest is a national priority. However, sustainable agriculture
   development is necessary in the state for the welfare of the local
   population. Maintaining soil fertility at an adequate level is an
   important component of sustainable farming. Very little information is
   available about soil fertility of Amazonas State. The objective of the
   present study was to evaluate chemical soil properties of Amazonas State
   of Brazil. Results include chemical properties of 3,340 samples,
   covering 62 municipalities of the state collected at 0-20cm deep during
   30 years (1975-2005). Chemical properties {[}phosphorus (P), potassium
   (K) extracted with Mehlich 1, calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), aluminum
   (Al) extracted with potassium chloride (KCl) 1.0 molL-1, potential
   acidity (H + Al) extracted with calcium acetate, and base saturation]
   presented great variation, except cation exchange capacity (CEC) and pH
   (water). Most of the soil samples were characterized as having high
   acidity; medium level of organic-matter content; low levels of P, K, Ca,
   and Mg; and high levels of Al and H + Al. Overall, base saturation was
   less than 20\%, a value considered very low for most of annual crops.
   Soils from upland areas were more acidic and have poor fertility
   compared with lowland soils. To maintain sustainability of cropping
   systems, use of an adequate level of liming and chemical fertilizers are
   necessary on these soils.}},

Abstract = {{Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the
   dominant cropping system in the Vertisols of central India due to
   congenial climate, development of agro-industries, and export
   opportunities. Both are high-value crops, and raising them using
   organics may further improve produce quality and help in sustaining
   long-term productivity of the system. Information is lacking on how to
   sustain the system with the sole use of organics or biofertilisers in
   Vertisols. A long-term study was made during 1995-2002 at Indore, India,
   to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 organic manures {[}farmyard manure
   (FYM), poultry manure (PM) and vermicompost (VC) at varying rates] and
   biofertilisers (Azotobacter+phosphate solubilising bacteria) on
   productivity, grain quality, soil fertility, and profitability of a
   wheat-soybean cropping system. Grain yield of wheat was significantly
   increased with PM at 2.5-10 t/ha or FYM at 10-20 t/ha compared with the
   control. However, the highest productivity was obtained with PM at 10
   t/ha, which even performed better than NPK, indicating that NPK
   fertilisers alone did not provide adequate and balanced nutrition for
   potential yield of the crop. Quality parameters of durum wheat, viz.
   protein content, hectolitre weight and sedimentation value, increased,
   while yellow berry content decreased significantly with PM at 2.5-10.0
   t/ha compared with the control. Soybean yields were significantly
   influenced by the residual effect of organic manuring treatment applied
   to wheat. The treatment receiving PM at 10 t/ha produced the highest
   grain yield of wheat. However, this treatment could not produce a
   similar response in soybean yield due to production of excessive
   vegetative growth, adversely affecting grain yield. Superiority of PM
   over FYM, vermicompost and biofertilisers was evident in the overall
   profitability of the system. Various soil fertility parameters including
   chemical and biological properties showed conspicuous improvement over
   the initial status under the FYM and PM treatments. Microbial biomass C
   and activities of phosphatase and dehydrogenase were increased
   significantly with applications of manures. Sustainability yield index
   was maximum under PM at 5-10 t/ha, followed by NPK. Results suggested
   that application of PM at 5-10 t/ha to wheat was essential for improving
   productivity, grain quality, profitability, soil health, and
   sustainability of a wheat-soybean system.}},

Title = {{Row spacing and planting density effects on the growth and yield of
   sugarcane. 1. Responses in fumigated and non-fumigated soil}},
Journal = {{CROP \& PASTURE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{60}},

Pages = {{532-543}},
Abstract = {{It has been reported that high-density planting of sugarcane can improve
   cane and sugar yield through promoting rapid canopy closure and
   increasing radiation interception earlier in crop growth. It is widely
   known that the control of adverse soil biota through fumigation (removes
   soil biological constraints and improves soil health) can improve cane
   and sugar yield. Whether the responses to high-density planting and
   improved soil health are additive or interactive has important
   implications for the sugarcane production system.
   Field experiments established at Bundaberg and Mackay, Queensland,
   Australia, involved all combinations of 2-row spacings (0.5 and 1.5 m),
   two planting densities (27 000 and 81 000 two-eyed setts/ha), and two
   soil fumigation treatments (fumigated and non-fumigated). The Bundaberg
   experiment had two cultivars (Q124, Q155), was fully irrigated, and
   harvested 15 months after planting. The Mackay experiment had one
   cultivar (Q117), was grown under rainfed conditions, and harvested 10
   months after planting.
   High-density planting (81 000 setts/ha in 0.5-m rows) did not produce
   any more cane or sugar yield at harvest than low-density planting (27
   000 setts/ha in 1.5-m rows) regardless of location, crop duration (15 v.
   10 months), water supply (irrigated v. rainfed), or soil health
   (fumigated v. non-fumigated). Conversely, soil fumigation generally
   increased cane and sugar yields regardless of site, row spacing, and
   planting density. In the Bundaberg experiment there was a large
   fumigation x cultivar x density interaction (P<0.01). Cultivar Q155
   responded positively to higher planting density in non-fumigated soil
   but not in fumigated soil, while Q124 showed a negative response to
   higher planting density in non-fumigated soil but no response in
   fumigated soil. In the Mackay experiment, Q117 showed a non-significant
   trend of increasing yield in response to increasing planting density in
   non-fumigated soil, similar to the Q155 response in non-fumigated soil
   at Bundaberg.
   The similarity in yield across the range of row spacings and planting
   densities within experiments was largely due to compensation between
   stalk number and stalk weight, particularly when fumigation was used to
   address soil health. Further, the different cultivars (Q124 and Q155 at
   Bundaberg and Q117 at Mackay) exhibited differing physiological
   responses to the fumigation, row spacing, and planting density
   treatments. These included the rate of tiller initiation and subsequent
   loss, changes in stalk weight, and propensity to lodging. These
   responses suggest that there may be potential for selecting cultivars
   suited to different planting configurations.}},

Title = {{Agriculture in central Tibet: an assessment of climate, farming systems,
   and strategies to boost production}},
Journal = {{CROP \& PASTURE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{627-639}},
Abstract = {{In the south of the Tibet Autonomous Region of China there is a network
   of valleys where intensive agriculture is practiced. Although considered
   highly productive by Tibetans, farm incomes in the region are low,
   leading to a range of government initiatives to boost grain and fodder
   production. However, there is limited information available on current
   farming practices, yields, and likely yield constraints. The present
   paper uses available data and farmer interviews to describe the
   agro-climate and current systems of crop and livestock production, and
   considers possible strategies to boost production. Although winters in
   Tibet are cold and dry, summer and autumn provide ideal conditions for
   crop growth. Cropping systems are characterised by heavy tillage,
   frequent irrigation, high seeding rates and fertiliser applications,
   some use of herbicides, and little stubble retention or mechanisation.
   Spring barley and winter wheat are the predominant crops, followed by
   rapeseed, winter barley, and minor fodder and vegetable crops. Average
   yields for the main grain crops are around 4.0 t/ha for spring barley
   and 4.5 t/ha for winter wheat, significantly lower than should be
   possible in the environment. Farmers typically keep five or six cattle
   tethered near the household. Cattle are fed diets based on crop residues
   but are generally malnourished and rarely produce beyond the needs of
   the family. It is suggested that research and extension in the areas of
   crop nutrition, weed control, irrigation, seeding technology, and crop
   varieties should enable significant increases in grain yield. Increases
   in cattle production will require increases in the supply of good
   quality fodder. Cereal/fodder intercrops or double crops sown using
   no-till seed drills might enable the production of useful amounts of
   fodder in many areas without jeopardising food grain supply, and allow
   more crop residues to be retained in fields for improved soil health.}},

Abstract = {{Bioavailability in heterogeneous media such as soils is a
   multi-factorial concept which ranges from soil chemistry to toxicity.
   The complexity Of this factor has been tackled by various studies
   pinpointing its relevancy for laboratory to field extrapolation of
   toxicity data. As contaminant bioavailability on these sites is
   virtually unknown, a global assessment of this issue has been conducted
   on soils impacted by antitank firing from a Canadian Range and Training
   Area (RTA) and contaminated by energetic materials (EM) and metals. Yet,
   the descriptive results acquired from this survey require further
   in-depth analysis so as to enhance understanding of soil health status.
   Statistical models as well as an index integrating biomarker responses
   were derived from this database and are proposed as diagnostic,
   explanatory and possibly predictive tools for soil bioavailability and
   quality assessment. Relationships associating bioaccessible contaminant
   levels to soil properties allowed to clarify contaminant behaviour in
   energetic material (EM)-contaminated soils. Likewise, models expressing
   biomarker responses as a function of bioaccessible contaminant
   concentrations contributed to identify the contaminants causing toxicity
   in earthworms and to the comprehension of those toxic effects. The index
   of biomarker response was adapted from similar concepts applied in the
   aquatic environment and is an original contribution to terrestrial
   sites. The biomarker index data were in agreement with soil
   contamination profiles and represent therefore an interesting tool for
   soil quality appraisal. Such tools also offer a promising potential for
   the management of contaminated soils. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published

Abstract = {{Though irrigation with sewage water has potential benefits of meeting
   the water requirements, the sewage irrigation may mess up to harm the
   soil health. To assess the potential impacts of long-term sewage
   irrigation on soil health and to identify sensitive soil indicators,
   soil samples were collected from crop fields that have been irrigated
   with sewage water for more than 20 years. An adjacent rain-fed Leucaena
   leucocephala plantation system was used as a reference to compare the
   impact of sewage irrigation on soil qualities. Soils were analyzed for
   different physical, chemical, biological and biochemical parameters.
   Results have shown that use of sewage for irrigation improved the clay
   content to 18-22.7\%, organic carbon to 0.51-0.86\% and fertility status
   of soils. Build up in total N was up to 2,713 kg ha(-1), available N
   (397 kg ha(-1)), available P (128 kg ha(-1)), available K (524 kg
   ha(-1)) and available S (65.5 kg ha(-1)) in the surface (0.15 m) soil.
   Long-term sewage irrigation has also resulted a significant build-up of
   DTPA extractable Zn (314\%), Cu (102\%), Fe (715\%), Mn (197.2), Cd
   (203\%), Ni (1358\%) and Pb (15.2\%) when compared with the adjacent
   rain-fed reference soil. Soils irrigated with sewage exhibited a
   significant decrease in microbial biomass carbon (-78.2\%), soil
   respiration (-82.3\%), phosphatase activity (-59.12\%) and dehydrogenase
   activity (-59.4\%). An attempt was also made to identify the sensitive
   soil indicators under sewage irrigation, where microbial biomass carbon
   was singled out as the most sensitive indicator.}},

Abstract = {{Soil ecosystem functioning is vital to the sustained functioning of the
   biosphere. Many processes occur in soils. These include the recycling of
   nutrients from previous crop residues to maintain primary production,
   and the consequent introduction of the sun's energy into the biosphere.
   Other processes that enhance environmental quality such as the
   suppression of plant pathogens, carbon sequestration and bioremediation
   also occur. Soils support one of the most diverse ecosystems in the
   biosphere, with a population consisting of many thousands of species of
   bacteria, protozoa, fungi and micro-, meso-and macro-fauna, which are
   responsible for a large number of functional processes. The soil
   population varies greatly in types, numbers and functional expression
   both temporally and spatially, and is responsive to a variety of inputs
   and physical conditions. These are dynamic systems that are constantly
   evolving and changing, in which many components are intrinsically
   interconnected, and conversely others are completely autonomous. Plant
   inputs are the major drivers of soil ecosystem functioning, and
   responses to these inputs vary according to both the quantity of these
   inputs and the constituent chemicals. These inputs come from roots, root
   exudates and debris, and residues from the aerial parts during active
   plant growth and from senescing material after the plant dies. They
   provide energy from the breakdown of the carbon fixed during primary
   production in the plant, and frequently, although consequentially,
   nitrogen, in many forms. Inputs differ in both amounts and types of
   compounds according to plant species. Hence, different plants can have
   differing effects on soil process dynamics. Soil organisms are also
   involved in other nutrient acquisitions such as phosphorous mobilization
   and metal chelation to enable plant uptake, as well as mycorrhizal
   associations. Their activities also impact on soil health and quality,
   with subsequent impacts on water quality and supply. Without these
   soil-ecosystem-driven phenomena primary production would cease. Here the
   possible impacts of genetically modified (GM) crops on agricultural and
   natural systems are considered. However, it should be borne in mind that
   all the topics considered will apply equally to the introduction of new,
   or indeed different, cultivars or crops, since it is the consequences of
   changed inputs from these that are relevant. Similarly, many changes in
   agronomic practice, such as cultivation technique and timing, planting
   and sowing rates, pesticide usage, etc., must also be considered. The
   environmental impacts of these should receive equal attention as these
   large perturbations that are routinely applied to soil ecosystems during
   normal agricultural management practices have significant impacts on
   soil communities and functions (Buckley and Schmidt, 2001). These and
   other factors such as plant type being cultivated, season, climate and
   geography may well be much greater drivers of community structure in the
   rhizosphere than any changes in inputs resulting from GM of the crop

Abstract = {{The rice-wheat cropping system of Indian agriculture is the cornerstone
   of the nation's food security. This system contributes about 75\% of the
   nation's total food grain production. It has tremendously helped the
   socio-economic development of the rural population in India. The Green
   Revolution in India during the late 1960s has no doubt brought about
   self-sufficiency in food grain production. However, imbalanced use of
   inorganic fertilizers and plant protection chemicals for maximizing crop
   yield has resulted in the deterioration of physical, chemical and
   biological health of the rice-wheat growing soils. Currently, there is a
   growing concern about the sustainability of the rice-wheat cropping
   system as the growth rates of rice and wheat yields have either become
   stagnant or declined in rice-wheat growing states like Punjab, Haryana,
   eastern Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu \&
   Kashmir, as well as southern and other states. The crisis of the
   rice-wheat cropping system in India is mainly due to the decline in the
   annual average growth rate, the Green Revolution and environmental
   degradation, the Green Revolution and inequality, and growing
   indebtedness. The various remedies responsible for breaking down
   sustainability issues to maintain the rice-wheat cropping system, some
   of which are very important, are use of organic manures, green manures,
   rural wastes and crop residues, bio-fertilizers, vermicompost and use of
   organics and inorganics. The one and only solution for the
   above-mentioned crisis for the rice-wheat cropping system is the use of
   both organics and inorganics, i.e. Integrated Nutrient Management (INM)
   System. Moreover, our former Secretary of the Department of Agricultural
   Research and Education (DARE) and Director General of Indian Council of
   Agricultural Research (ICAR), Dr. R.S. Paroda, declared INM system as a
   mission for the twenty-first century. He stressed upon demonstrating
   sustained agricultural production through high input of inorganic and
   organic fertilizers.}},

Abstract = {{India accounts for 2.2\% of the global land and 16\% of the world's
   population. The country's population has crossed the one-billion mark in
   2001. While the population is likely to further increase at an alarming
   rate and, side by side, as the land for cultivation of crops will
   decrease tremendously in the following decades, it will result in an
   increased demand for food, fodder, shelter, energy, employment, etc. The
   long-term fertilizer experiments have shown that continuous application
   of suboptimal doses of chemical fertilizers alone to soil has resulted
   in the deterioration of soil health, thereby culminating in
   environmental pollution and stagnation in crop productivity. Hence,
   integrated use of organic manures with optimal levels of NPK fertilizer
   is the need of the hour, as it will not only improve the nutrient status
   and soil health, but also prove to be a boon in stabilizing the crop
   yields over a period of time. Therefore, integrated nutrient management
   (INM) system is the only way to maintain and improve the nutrient status
   of Indian soils. In other words, INM system is an ecologically, socially
   and economically viable approach, which on the whole is non-hazardous.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have revealed that continuous use of suboptimal doses of
   nutrients in the intensive cropping system has led to severe depletion
   of nutrient reserves in soil, causing multiple nutrient deficiencies.
   The use of high-analysis fertilizers devoid of micronutrients has also
   aggravated micronutrient deficiencies causing significant decline in
   crop productivity. No single dose of plant nutrient applied through
   chemical fertilizers, organic manures, crop residues or bio-fertilizers
   can meet the entire nutrient need of a crop in modern intensive
   agriculture. Rather, these need to be used in an integrated manner
   following a management technology which is practicable, economically
   viable, socially acceptable and ecologically sound. In this chapter, the
   rising need for INM system due to escalating prices of chemical
   fertilizers, imbalances in the ratio of NPK consumption, imbalances
   between consumption and domestic production, deterioration of soil
   health, consumption of non-renewable energy by inorganic fertilizers,
   deterioration in soil health, pollution hazards of chemical fertilizers,
   loss of chemical productivity, deterioration in soil physical properties
   and biological activity, additive effects of organic fertilizers as a
   source of secondary nutrients and micronutrients, and decline in crop
   productivity through inorganics have been discussed.}},

   everything everywhere; rather, a well-considered practical and efficient
   blend of diverse nutrient sources is required which can produce desired
   yields and maintain soil health on long-term basis. INM system helps to
   restore and sustain crop productivity, and also assists in checking the
   emerging micronutrient deficiencies. Further, it brings economy and
   efficiency in the use of fertilizers. In this chapter, the main
   components ofINM system are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{After the Green Revolution agriculture was mainly based upon a package
   of various agricultural inputs, namely the use of high-yielding
   varieties of different crops, water, pesticides and chemical
   fertilizers. Excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers in many rice- and
   wheat-producing states in comparison to phosphatic and potassic
   fertilizers has not only deteriorated the soil health but has also
   impaired the health of human beings and animals (Gupta and Singh, 2006).
   Similarly indiscriminate and excessive use of pesticides produced health
   hazards in animals and human beings and soil macro/micro flora and fauna
   (Gupta and Singh, 2008). Thus, to reinforce the development of
   sustainable agriculture, use of bio-fertilizers has assured great
   promise to mete out the nutrient demand. The term `bio-fertilizers'
   denotes nutrient supplement inputs for plant growth which are biological
   in origin. The role of bio-fertilizers in agricultural production
   assumes special significance, particularly in the present context of
   expensive chemical fertilizers. Moreover, it can provide the farmers
   with a new strategy which is helpful for achieving the goal of
   increasing productivity. Keeping in mind the environment safety food
   security and availability of resources, it becomes obligatory to harness
   the full potential of the available bio-fertilizers.}},

   2010 and 2025, respectively, for the required food grain production of
   the increased human population. However, use of all tapable nutrients
   would not be sufficient to produce the required food grains for the

Abstract = {{The concept of balanced fertilization is very simple and was in fact
   developed more than 150 years ago. Application of balanced fertilization
   is the key in enhancing nutrient use efficiency of the applied plant
   nutrients for maintaining soil productivity. It ensures the application
   of fertilizers in optimum quantities and in right proportion through
   appropriate methods, which in turn results in sustenance of soil
   fertility and crop productivity. Balanced fertilization leads to
   building up soil health, while imbalanced fertilization leads to soil
   mining and its sickness. Only soil building, leads to a sustainable land
   use system where most food grain production continues to collie from the
   existing agricultural land. It is well documented that unbalanced
   availability of nutrients not only produces low and poor-quality yield,
   but can also lead to mining of soil nutrient reserves which results in
   short supply. Thus, to obtain higher fertilizer use efficiency, a
   certain balance among the various nutrients is very essential.}},

Pages = {{139-168}},
Abstract = {{To meet the ever-increasing demand for food of the huge population of
   the Indian subcontinent and to exploit the high yield potential of
   cereals, it requires higher fertilizer doses, which are a non-renewable
   source of energy. However, long-term fertilizer experiments have
   revealed that continuous application of suboptimal doses of chemical
   fertilizers to soil has resulted in the deterioration of soil health,
   environmental pollution and stagnation or decrease in crop productivity.
   Thus, integrated use of organic manures with optimal levels of NPK
   fertilizers is the need of the day that will not only improve the
   nutrient status and soil health but has also shown greater potential in
   stabilizing crop yields over a period of time. The integrated use of
   organics and chemical fertilizers at optimum levels as determined by
   soil tests in long-term fertilizer experiments indicate the build-up of
   micronutrient and secondary nutrient reserves such as Zn, Cu, Mn, Ca, Mg
   and S. Therefore, INM in sustainable rice-wheat cropping system is of
   paramount importance. It will also ensure increased crop productivity in
   an efficient and environmentally benign manner, without diminishing the
   capacity of the soil to produce for present and future generations. In
   other words, INM system is an ecologically, socially and economically
   viable approach, which on the whole is non-hazardous. In this chapter,
   the importance and beneficial role of various organic sources (organic
   manures like FYM, compost, green manures, crop residues, vermicompost,
   bio-fertilizers, leguminous crops and locally available nutrient
   sources) in conjunction with chemical fertilizers are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{There are very few practical demonstrations of the phytoextraction of
   metals and metalloids from soils and sediments beyond small-scale and
   short-term trials. The two approaches used have been based on using 1)
   hyperaccumulator species, such as Thlaspi caerulescens (Pb, Zn, Cd, Ni),
   Alyssum spp. (Ni, Co), and Pteris vittata (As) or 2) fast-growing
   plants, such as Salix and Populus spp. that accumulate above-average
   concentrations of only a smaller number of the more mobile trace
   elements (Cd, Zn, B). Until we have advanced much more along the pathway
   of genetic isolation and transfer of hyperaccumulator traits into
   productive plants, there is a high risk in marketing either approach as
   a technology or stand-alone solution to clean up contaminated land.
   There are particular uncertainties over the longer-term effectiveness of
   phytoextraction and associated environmental issues. Marginally
   contaminated agricultural soils provide the most likely land use where
   phytoextraction can be used as a polishing technology. An alternative
   and more useful practical approach in many situations currently would be
   to give more attention to crops selected for phytoexclusion: selecting
   crops that do not translocate high concentrations of metals to edible
   parts. Soils of brownfield, urban, and industrial areas provide a
   large-scale opportunity to use phytoremediation, but the focus here
   should be on the more realistic possibilities of risk-managed
   phytostabilization and monitored natural attenuation. We argue that the
   wider practical applications of phytoremediation are too often
   overlooked. There is huge scope for cross-cutting other environmental
   agenda, with synergies that involve the recovery and provision of
   services from degraded landscapes and contaminated soils. An additional
   focus on biomass energy, improved biodiversity, watershed management,
   soil protection, carbon sequestration, and improved soil health is
   required for the justification and advancement of phytotechnologies.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality can reflect soil fertility quality, environmental quality
   of soil and soil health quality. Because coal mining site was subjected
   to heavy human disturbance, it had severe impacts on soil quality to a
   great degree. By field investigation and office analysis, we established
   indicators system of physical and chemical factors of soil. Based on
   this, soil quality assessment was performed by using fuzzy comprehensive
   assessment method. Research results showed that soil quality assessment
   values were very slow and soil quality was very high in the negative
   direction of monsoon due to faint wind diffusion and precipitation
   eluviation and there were obvious rules between soil quality and soil
   samples positions.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial cell concentration is a particularly important bioindicator of
   soil health and a yardstick for determining biological quotients which
   are likely to gain in ecological significance if they are calculated in
   relation to the viable, rather than total, microbial density. A
   dual-staining technique with fluorescent dyes was used for the
   spectrofluorimetric quantitative determination of the concentration of
   viable microbial cells present in three different soil types. This is a
   novel and substantially modified application of the dual-staining
   procedure implemented in the LIVE/DEAD (TM) BacLight (R) viability kit
   which has never been successfully applied to the quantification of
   naturally occurring soil microbial communities. Indigenous microbial
   cell concentrations were quantified using an internal standard, i.e.
   spiking environmental samples with suspensions containing different
   concentrations of live E coli cells, and external calibration, by
   comparing fluorescence emission by indigenous bacteria and known
   concentrations of E coli in nutrient saline. Two types of environmental
   samples were tested: bacterial preparations obtained by density gradient
   centrifugation and soil suspensions. In both cases, prior dilution of
   the sample was necessary to minimise fluorescence quenching by soil
   particulate matter. Spectrofluorimetric measurements of indigenous cell
   concentration in bacterial preparations were in close agreement with
   those found using epifluorescence microscopy. Limits of detection of 5 x
   10(6) for the soil bacterial preparations and 8 x 10(7) for the soil
   suspensions were estimated. Deviations observed when soil suspensions
   are dealt with are likely due to the selection of a unique bacterial
   strain for standardisation and calibration. Thorough testing of a
   variety of reference bacteria and fungi is suggested to determine a more
   accurate average fluorescence enhancement per microbial cell or mass
   unit. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil nutrient and physical status in small holder farms in southeastern
   Nigeria are subjected to debilitating effects of continuous cropping
   without adequate efforts towards replenishment and conservation to
   ensure sustainability of soil resources. Although inorganic fertilizers
   are quick acting for soil nutrient enhancement, to guarantee soil health
   they must be used within the context of integrated soil fertility
   management relative to soil type and other climatic conditions. On the
   other hand, apart from maintaining required nutrient levels, the use of
   appropriate crop combinations and arrangements in farmers' fields can
   improve soil health. Leguminous plants including tree, shrub and annual
   species have been determined to be useful components in such systems.
   These species can contribute immensely to soil carbon and other mineral
   contents in addition to improving soil physical properties. Apart from
   their high edible protein content, some leguminous seeds also have high
   phytate content, which should enhance the bioavailability of Zn, making
   them good nutrient sources in human and animal nutrition. However,
   indigenous leguminous tree, shrub, and grain legume species are
   currently underutilized in the common cropping systems on smallholder
   farms. While tree species are lost through logging, with very limited
   research toward their improvement, research on grain legumes has been
   limited in this zone resulting in the loss of indigenous grain species.
   Low available soil P is another constraint to legume cultivation in this
   region that has to be addressed through well coordinated agronomic
   research. Increased and sustainable food production on small holder
   farms in southeastern Nigeria is possible with improved practices within
   the prevailing cropping systems. This is achievable with intensive
   breeding, agronomic and utilization studies on legume species in the
   cropping systems.}},

Abstract = {{Soil health is an assessment of ability of a soil to meet its range of
   ecosystem functions appropriate to its environment. Soil health is
   generally used to measure the competence of soil to sustain plant and
   animal productivity, determine structural and functional diversity of
   microbes, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and support human
   health and habitation. Direct assessment of such parameters is a
   herculean task. As biological attributes are indicators of soil health,
   they are used for the diagnosis of soil heath. A comprehensive
   methodology integrating those indicators for soil health diagnosis is
   discussed. Further, the impact of soil health on crop production,
   quality improvement, production sustenance, and human, animal and
   environmental health is reviewed and discussed. In addition, the
   influence of soil management practices, like tillage, application of
   pesticides, fertilization, organic amendments, etc., on soil health is
   discussed. Inclusion of farmers and their experiences in the whole
   exercise of soil research are advocated for development of handy and
   farmer-friendly soil diagnosis protocols.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of ``fallow{''} has been a prominent management tactic in
   semiarid regions of the world, enabling producers to compensate for low
   precipitation. However, fallow phases lead to soil degradation. For
   example, winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow with tillage has
   been used for decades in the semiarid steppe of the United States;
   organic matter levels in soils have declined almost 60\%. Thus,
   producers in this region are concerned about the future sustainability
   of this rotation. No-till practices, however, improve water relations
   such that more crops can be added to the winter wheat-fallow rotation.
   This change in cropping patterns has led producers to seek cropping
   systems that are economically viable, restore soil health, improve
   resource-use-efficiency, and reduce the need for external inputs such as
   pesticides and fertilizers. Long-term rotation studies in the steppe
   show that continuous cropping with no-till can accrue these four goals.
   However, with water supply often being limiting, rotation design is
   critical for success with continuous cropping. Designing rotations in a
   cycle-of-four with a diversity of crops, increases net returns four-fold
   while reducing the cost of weed management 50\% compared with
   conventional systems. Continuous cropping for 12 years increased soil
   organic carbon by 37\% and nitrogen by 20\% in the top 5 cm of soil, and
   also improved soil porosity and aggregate stability. Consequently, soil
   productivity has increased two-fold. Also, the cycle-of-four design
   provides a crop niche for legumes in this semiarid climate, which
   further enhances soil function. Some crops improve water-use-efficiency
   of the following crops by 20-35\%, thus ameliorating the impact of low
   precipitation. Continuous cropping with no-till has initiated a spiral
   of soil regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Although, phosphorus is abundant in soils in both organic and inorganic
   forms, it is frequently a major or even the prime limiting factor for
   plant growth. The bioavailability of soil inorganic P in the rhizosphere
   varies considerably with plant species, nutritional status of soil and
   ambient soil conditions. To overcome the P deficiency,
   phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms {[}PSM] could play an important
   role in supplying phosphate to plants in a more environment friendly and
   sustainable manner. The solubilization of phosphatic compounds by PSM is
   though, common under in vitro conditions; the performance of PSM in situ
   has been contradictory. The variations in the performance has thus,
   greatly hampered the large-scale application of PSM {[}s]. The challenge
   is therefore, how to make use of such biological resources to maintain
   soil health while increasing the crop productivity by providing P to
   plants through the application of PSM. Moreover, unlike, animal and
   plant ecologists which can quantify and identify different species
   through {[}relatively] easily identifiable traits, it is extremely
   difficult to do this with microbial communities, because microbes vary
   greatly in their numbers and their associated activities.
   The assessment of the composition and/or function of soil microbial
   communities including PSM thus, present a number of challenges, due to
   which less than 1\% of bacterial species and an unknown percentage of
   fungi have been recovered so far. The present chapter focuses on the
   screening, development and mode of inoculants application and mechanisms
   of P solubilization by microbes.}},

Abstract = {{The Montreal Protocol has been very effective in reducing the
   consumption of the major ozone depleting chemical, methyl bromide (MB),
   and represents an excellent model for future phaseout of other
   environmentally damaging products, such as those involved with climate
   change. Over a ten year period, 85\% of MB (c. 45,000 tonnes) used for
   preplant soil fumigation has been phased out and a wide range of
   chemical and non chemical technologies adopted for disease and weed
   control in agriculture. Restrictions on the use of MB have stimulated
   new research and knowledge on: (1) soil health and relationships between
   soil microbial diversity and crop growth, and (2) new crop protection
   agents and production systems that moderate the need for harsh
   pesticides in agriculture. This has also led to increased use of
   substrate systems, grafting and plant resistance for disease control
   which, in most cases, avoid the need for soil disinfestation. Also other
   fumigants, such as 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3D)/chloropicrin (Pic), metham
   sodium, iodomethane (MI)/Pic, drip applied fumigants and barrier films
   have been adopted by growers as alternatives strategies for soil
   disinfestation. Implementation of a wide range of alternatives has led
   to a 50\% fall in anthropogenic bromine in the troposphere and 30\%
   reduction in effective chlorine load to date in the stratosphere. This
   has been hugely significant to the start of ozone layer recovery which
   should be observed within the next few years.
   Internationally, pressure is mounting to restrict use of all fumigants
   worldwide (EC Reg 2037/US Cluster Analysis) and this will further
   stimulate new technologies for plant disease control. There are also
   moves to restrict MB, approx. 10,300 tonnes a year, used for quarantine
   and pre-shipment (QPS). The pressure on fumigant use globally is
   stimulating development of more sustainable crop protection, biosecurity
   and integrated pest management (IPM) strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In India, various agricultural extension programs have been
   conceptualized and implemented since independence to increase the crop
   production at various fronts so to meet the growing demand of increasing
   population on one hand and also to reduce the imports. of such products
   on the other hand. In the past couple of decades a large number of crop
   production technologies evolved have been adopted by different
   categories of farmers of Haryana State in Northern India that has not
   only increased the farm production but the profits made by the farming
   community have improvised their standard of living and changed their way
   of life. The ``inherent and latent effects{''} of intensive agriculture
   leading to higher crop production at the cost of lowering of water
   table, poor soil health and environmental degradation had called for the
   attention of the scientists, policy makers and the producers to look for
   newer strategies for having sustainable agriculture. Present study was
   conducted in Haryana State of Northern India that has three zones based
   on the rain fall irrigation facilities. Framers of the state have
   different cropping patterns and cropping intensity. Wheat production in
   the state increased to 10.05 million tonnes in 2008-09 from 10.02
   million tonnes in 2007-08, the state also recorded an all-time high
   productivity of 42.68 quintals of wheat per hectare. A recent survey
   indicated that 40 per cent of the farmers in Haryana State have switched
   over to ``zero-tillage{''} in wheat crop cultivation. Use of Zero
   Tillage has had reduced the cost of cultivation up to U.S. \$ 50 per
   hectare and water used for one irrigation is also saved. The farmers in
   some districts of the State were earlier growing two crops of paddy
   followed by wheat cultivation have switched over to one crop of paddy
   followed by wheat and pulse crops so to save water which was intensively
   used for irrigating two paddy crops five years ago. The promotion of
   pulse crop cultivation has also improved soil health in the area.
   Majority of farmers having land holding up to four hectares practice
   mixed farming of crop and dairy husbandry that was found more
   sustainable and organic in nature as both these sub-systems of the
   farming were found complimentary and supplementary to each other and had
   symbiotic relationship. A few farmers have changed their cropping
   pattern and have adopted cultivation of paddy-wheat-sorghum,
   paddy-potato-maize. A large number of small farmers having land holding
   up to one hectare have recently adopted vermi compost in growing
   different crops. It is since June 2009 that to conserve water in paddy
   cultivation with the help of IRRI, Philippines and CIMMYT, Mexico trials
   have been initiated in different locations of the state to cultivate
   paddy without raising and transplanting paddy nursery and using direct
   seeding and broadcasting methods are being tried. In the present paper
   the approaches used and adopted for attaining sustainable agriculture
   that has led to agriculture in transition have been discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Raised beds are widely used in agriculture in developed countries and
   have proven to be an excellent option for wheat. Permanent raised beds
   may also offer benefits for rice-wheat (RW) systems in South Asia, in
   terms of both production and the possibility that furrow-irrigation may
   be more efficient than flood irrigation. The performance of a RW system
   on permanent raised beds (37 cm wide, 15 cm high, furrow width 30 cm)
   was compared with conventional cultivation on the flat on sandy loam and
   loam soils in replicated experiments in central Punjab, India. The
   experiments commenced with wheat sown in November 2002, and were
   continued for 8 crops.
   Yields of conventionally tilled wheat (CTW) ranged from 3.6 to 4.9 t
   ha(-1) and tended to be higher on the loam than on the sandy loam.
   Yields of wheat on fresh and permanent beds (WB and DDWB, respectively)
   were similar to yields on CTW and direct-drilled wheat on the flat (DDW)
   except when establishment was sub-optimal on the beds on both soils in
   2004-2005. It was also lower on the beds on the sandy loam in 2002-2003
   when tillering did not compensate for the lower sowing rate on the beds.
   In each case, the poorer performance on beds appeared to be associated
   with the more rapid drying of the beds than the flats, and thus the need
   for greater precision in irrigation and sowing management with beds on
   sandy loam and loam soils. Yield on beds relative to flats did not
   change as the beds aged.
   Yields of transplanted rice on permanent beds (TRB) were depressed
   relative to yields of puddled transplanted rice (PTR) with the same
   alternate wetting and drying water management, regardless of age of the
   bed (from 1st to 8th crop) and soil type. Yields of TRB relative to PTR
   declined as the beds aged, over the first 2-3 years, from about 80 to
   90\% to less than 50\% of PTR. Biomass production in TRB was always
   significantly less than in M, starting from 35 d after transplanting.
   Performance of direct-seeded rice on beds (DSRB) was even poorer.
   Serious root knot nematode infestation was also a serious problem in
   transplanted rice on the sandy loam in the absence of continuous
   flooding, on both TRB and PTR. The DSRB suffered from severe iron
   deficiency each year on both soils despite several iron sprays beginning
   as early as 15 days after transplanting, and yields declined from about
   60\% of PTR with the same irrigation scheduling in the first rice crop
   to less than 25\% of PTR in the third rice crop.
   Total annual system productivity was highest using puddled transplanted
   rice (PTR) in rotation with fresh beds (WB) for wheat, CTW or DDW on the
   flat. Average productivity of these systems over the first 4 years was
   9.5 t ha(-1) y(-1) on a sandy loam soil and 10.3 t ha(-1) y(-1) on a
   loam soil. Productivity of RW on permanent raised beds with transplanted
   rice declined as the beds aged, and averaged 77-79\% of the productivity
   of the best systems mainly due to declining yield of TRB relative to
   PTR. Averaged over the first 3 years, productivity of permanent beds
   with direct-seeded rice (DSRB) was even lower (only 62-68\% of the best
   systems) due to much lower yields of DSRB.
   Permanent bed RW systems seem to have limited potential under the
   prevailing soil and climatic conditions of Punjab. India, with current
   varieties and management. Further research on permanent raised beds for
   RW systems should focus on the selection of suitable rice and wheat
   cultivars, soil health issues such as nematodes and iron deficiency,
   weed control, irrigation scheduling, N management and soil compaction.

Abstract = {{We investigated the power of near infrared (NIR) analysis for the
   quantitative assessment of soil quality in a wildfire chronosequence.
   The effect of wildfire disturbance and soil engineering activity of
   earthworms on soil organic matter quality was first assessed with
   principal component analysis of NIR spectra. Three soil quality indices
   were further calculated using an adaptation of the method proposed by
   Velasquez et al. {[}Velasquez, E., Lavelle, P., Andrade, M. GISQ a
   multifunctional indicator of soil quality. Soil Biol Biochem 2007; 39:
   3066-3080.], each one addressing an ecosystem service provided by soils:
   organic matter storage, nutrient supply and biological activity. Partial
   least squares regression models were developed to test the predicting
   ability of NIR analysis for these soil quality indices. All models
   reached coefficients of determination above 0.90 and ratios of
   performance to deviation above 2.8. This finding provides new
   opportunities for the monitoring of soil quality, using NIR scanning of
   soil samples. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Earthworm densities have been regarded as reliable indicators of Soil
   health, but their role in suppression of plant disease has not received
   much attention. Several greenhouse studies were done to determine it
   soils infested with soilborne pathogens and augmented with earthworms
   (Lumbricus terrestris) could reduce disease of susceptible cultivars of
   asparagus (Asparagus officinalis), eggplant (Solanum melongena), and
   tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Soils planted with asparagus were
   infested with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. asparagi and F. proliferatum,
   eggplant with Verticillium dahliae, and tomato with E oxysporum f. sp.
   lycopersici Race 1. In each host-disease system, earthworm activity was
   associated with all increase in plant growth and a decrease in disease.
   In general, plant weights were increased 60 to 80\% and estimates of
   disease (area under the disease progress curve, percent vascular
   discoloration, and percent root lesions) were reduced 50 to 70\%, when
   soils were augmented with earthworms. Soil dilutions on selective media
   revealed that densities of fluorescent pseudomonads and filamentous
   actinomycetes were consistently higher for rhizosphere Soils augmented
   with earthworms. In the studies With Verticillium wilt of eggplant,
   compared to the controls, the densities of total bacteria and
   Mn-transforming microbes were reduced in the presence of earthworms
   while population densities of bacilli and Trichoderma spp. were not
   affected. Disease suppression may have been mediated through
   microbiological activity. These studies suggest that strategies to
   increase earthworm densities in soil should suppress soilborne diseases.}},

Abstract = {{A knowledge-based system (KBS) for assessing soil condition in
   agroecosystems is presented. The KBS Was built through expert opinion
   elicitation and available scientific data using fuzzy logic. The system
   is structured into three main elements: (1) input variables that
   represent the physical domain of soil condition assessment and are
   related to environmental and crop management conditions; (2) primary
   modules that describe the fuzzy nature of the soil indicators and; (3)
   secondary modules that represent the elicited knowledge on soil
   condition assessment from an expert panel. The application of the KBS on
   data on crop fields from Inland Pampa (Argentina) indicated that soil
   nitrogen depletion poses a hazard for soil health as no crop was able to
   accomplish more than 50\% of the sustainability criteria elicited for
   soil nitrogen extraction from the system. Conversely, soil carbon and
   physical conditions exhibited values closer to the desirable scenarios
   elicited by the fuzzy if-then rules, with Values of 0.84, 0.71 and 0.74
   for maize, soybean and wheat, respectively, where higher indicator
   values reflect better soil condition assessment. No significant
   differences were observed in the overall soil degradation module between
   crops, with values of 0.64 for maize and wheat and 0.67 for soybean. The
   KBS developed in this work provided an alternative modeling tool for
   assessing agroecosystem condition when knowledge regarding long-term
   assessment is imprecise and uncertain. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted during 2004-7 in summer season to
   ascertain the effect of 2 organic inputs, viz enriched compost and
   vermicompost applied @ 2 tonnes/ha, on selected soil parameters for soil
   health, growth and nodulation of `Pusa Ratna' mungbean {[}Vigna radiata
   (L.) Wilczek]. The beneficial effects were compared not only to soils
   but also the growth of the crop without organic inputs. Organic matter,
   like vermicompost and enriched compost enhanced soil physical properties
   and plant nutrients (N, P and K) at the time of crop establishment and
   early growth. Incorporation of vermicompost and enriched compost before
   sowing had a greater beneficial impact, especially on physical
   properties of soil. The added organic materials, like vermicompost and
   enriched compost increased germination growth of shoots, roots and
   enhanced nodulation, the slightly greater benefits were derived with
   vermicompost as compared to enriched compost. The selected
   microorganisms used were Rhizobium, a symbiotic nitrogen fixer and
   phosphate-solubilizing bacteria which helps in solubilization of fixed

Abstract = {{Soil health is key for sustainable productivity and adaptation to
   climate change. Agricultural practice can significantly impact on soil
   health. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of two land
   management regimes on organisms (earthworms) that may be used as
   indicators for soil health via NMR metabolomics. Earthworms are
   important in the soil decomposition process and viewed as a sentinel
   species in soil. The presence/absence of earthworm species and their
   relative abundances provide a gross indication of the health of the soil
   and it is expected that land use would affect earthworm metabolism as
   the populations rose or declined in response to changing soil health
   parameters. In order to test this hypothesis metabolomics approaches
   were employed to determine if biological indicators of soil change can
   be detected. Two species of earthworms, an unidentified native species
   and the European species Aporrectodea caliginosa, were collected from
   properties in Victoria, Australia where the land was treated with either
   biological (organic) or conventional (chemical) treatment regimes. Both
   lipid and aqueous NMR metabolomics for earthworms was employed,
   demonstrating that class classifications can be achieved with both
   datasets and provide orthogonal, complementary, chemical information.
   The study indicates that land-use has a measurable effect on the
   biochemistry of worm populations. Potential biomarkers of land use and
   worm stress were found, including elevated levels of glucose, maltose,
   alanine and triacylglycerides. This study demonstrates the utility of
   NMR metabolomics approaches in detecting biomarkers related to land
   treatment regimes and potentially soil health attributes.}},

Abstract = {{Soil microbiological and chemical aspects were evaluated to determine
   the effects of conservation tillage and crop rotation on soil fertility
   over a 16-year period. A field trial was established to compare two
   cropping systems (continuous soybean and maize/soybean, soybean/maize
   rotation). In addition, maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.,
   Merr) were grown in two different tillage systems: no tillage and
   reduced tillage. Soil populations of Trichoderma spp., Gliocladium spp.
   and total fungi were more abundant when maize or soybean were under
   conservation tillage and in the maize/soybean and soybean/maize
   rotation, than in continuous soybean. Furthermore, higher levels of
   microbial respiration and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDA), were
   recorded under no tillage systems. However, soil counts of Actinomycetes
   and Pythium spp., and Pythium diversity together with soil microbial
   biomass were not affected by the field treatments. To establish a
   correlation with soil biological factors, soil chemical parameters, such
   as pH, organic matter content, total N, electrical conductivity, N-NO(3)
   (-) and P were also quantified, most of the correlations being
   significantly positive. Under no tillage there was a clear increase of
   the amount of crop residues and the C and N soil content due to the
   presence of residues. Also the distribution of crop residues in surface
   soil due to zero tillage and the quality of these residues, depending on
   the crop rotation employed, improved on soil biological and chemical
   characteristics. Crop yield was also enhanced by zero tillage through
   the management of residues. Although yield values were not directly
   associated with the development of microorganisms, both yield and
   microorganisms were influenced by crop management. These results suggest
   that measuring soil properties over a long period helps to define
   effective management strategies in order to preserve soil conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Soil samples from agricultural fields (cultivated) in the vicinity of
   industrial area of Ghaziabad City (India) were collected. In this city,
   wastewater coming from both industrial and domestic sources and without
   any treatment is used to irrigate the food crops. This practice has been
   polluting the soil and pollutants might reach the food chain. Gas
   chromatographic analysis show the presence of certain organochlorine
   (DDE, DDT, dieldrin, aldrin and endosulfan) and organophosphorus
   (dimethoate, malathion, methylparathion and chlorpyrifos) pesticides in
   soil samples. Samples were extracted using different solvents, i.e.
   methanol, chloroform, acetonitrile, hexane and acetone (all were
   HPLC-grade, SRL, India), and the extracts were assayed for genotoxic
   potential using Ames Salmonella/microsome test, DNA repair defective
   mutants and bacteriophage lambda systems. TA98 and TA100 were found to
   be the most sensitive strains to all the soil extracts tested. Methanol
   extracts exhibited a maximum mutagenicity with TA98 strain \{540 (-S9)
   and 638 (+S9) revertants/g of soil\} and 938 (-S9) and 1008 (+S9)
   revertants/g of soil with TA100 strain. The damage in the DNA repair
   defective mutants was found maximum with methanolic extract followed by
   acetonitrile, chloroform, hexane and acetone at the dose level of 40 mu
   l/ml culture after 6h of treatment. The survival was 25, 30,32,33 and
   35\% in polA strain after 6 h of treatment when tested with wastewater
   irrigated soil extracts of methanol, acetonitrile, chloroform, hexane
   and acetone, respectively. A significant decrease in the plaque forming
   units of bacteriophage X was also observed when treated with 40 mu l of
   test samples. Present results showed that methanolic extracts of soil
   were more toxic than other soil extracts. The soil is accumulating a
   large number of pollutants due to wastewater irrigation and this
   practice of accumulation has an impact on soil health. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This survey addresses the current nutritional status of orchards typical
   of a large portion of the United States pecan (Carya illinoinensis)
   industry. A leaf nutrition and soil fertility survey was conducted for
   commercial orchards in a major production area of the U.S. pecan belt,
   which is located in southern Georgia. The study sampled pecan orchards
   from 18 July to 5 Aug. 2005 and 17 July to 3 Aug. 2008. All orchards had
   a history of commercial level orchard management, and represented a wide
   range of orchards typical of the region. Results indicate that
   southeastern U.S. pecan producers should focus their nutrient inputs on
   nitrogen (N), potassium (K), sulfur (S), and copper (Cu) as needed. The
   survey results show that leaf N can vary widely by season and among
   orchard locations. Evidence indicates that many growers could likely
   forego the soil application of phosphorous (P) and zinc (Zn) until leaf
   or soil analysis indicates a need. Orchard soil organic matter (SOM) in
   2008 averaged 3.63\%, and ranged from 1.74\% on coarse-textured sandy
   soils to 5\% on sandy loam soils. Both SOM and soil nitrate-N were
   higher in orchards using clover (Trifolium spp.) as a cool-season
   orchard groundcover than those using a grass sod only. The mean carbon:S
   ratio of Georgia pecan orchard soils was 504:1, which may further reduce
   tree uptake of S from low-S soils.}},

Abstract = {{Aerobic rice is a new production system for water-short environments.
   Adapted varieties are usually direct dry seeded and the crop grown under
   aerobic soil conditions with supplementary irrigation as necessary.
   Occasionally, yield failures occur which may be related to soil health
   problems. In the dry season of 2006 and 2007, we conducted a field
   experiment in the Philippines, to identify the major causes of such
   yield failure. Four treatments were implemented: (i) Control of direct
   dry-seeded rice (improved upland variety Apo), (ii) Biocide application,
   (iii) transplanting into aerobic soil, and (iv) 1 year fallow. Yield in
   the Biocide treatment was 2 t ha(-1) in both years. In all other
   treatments, yield was 0-0.3 t ha(-1). Plants grown in the Biocide
   treatment showed a reduced degree of galling of roots caused by
   root-knot nematodes (RKN) and better general root health than the
   Control treatment. Potentially pathogenic fungi were isolated from root
   samples (Pythium sp.. Fusarium sp., and a Rhizoctonia-like species).
   Abiotic effects of the Biocide treatment were all increase in
   KCl-extractable N (initial season 2007) and a decrease in initial soil
   pH. In the Control treatment, soil pH increased froth 6.5 to 8.0 over
   the two seasons. In 2007, plant tissue analysis indicated Mn deficiency
   ill the Control treatment. Plants that were subjected to foliar
   micronutrient sprays reacted positively to Fe and Mn sprays ill the
   Control treatment, and Mn spray in the Biocide treatment. We concluded
   that the Biocide application led to favorable soil conditions by
   reducing biotic stresses such as RKN and improving nutrient
   availability. In the other treatments, all interaction of RKN and
   micronutrient deficiencies with increasing soil pH led to yield failure.

Abstract = {{The spread of pathogens in the environment due to human activities
   (pathogen pollution) may be involved in the emergence of many diseases
   in humans, livestock and wildlife. When manure from medicated livestock
   and urban effluents is spread onto agricultural land, both residues of
   antibiotics and bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance may be
   introduced into the environment. The transmission of bacterial
   resistance from livestock and humans to wildlife remains poorly
   understood even while wild animals may act as reservoirs of resistance
   that. may be amplified and spread in the environment. We determined
   bacterial resistance to antibiotics in wildlife using the red-billed
   chough Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax as a potential bioindicator of soil
   health, and evaluated the role of agricultural manuring with waste of
   different origins in the acquisition and characteristics of such
   resistance. Agricultural manure was found to harbor high levels of
   bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics. Choughs from areas where
   manure landspreading is a common agricultural practice harbor a high
   bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics, resembling the resistance
   profile found in the waste (pig slurry and sewage sludge) used in each
   area. The transfer of bacterial resistance to wildlife should be
   considered as an important risk for environmental health when
   agricultural manuring involves fecal material containing multiresistant
   enteric bacteria including pathogens from livestock operations and urban
   areas. The assessment of bacterial resistance in wild animals may be
   valuable for the monitoring of environmental health and for the
   management of emergent infectious diseases influenced by the impact of
   different human activities in the environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Intensive cropping and exhaustive nature of sugarcane-wheat-rice
   cropping system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia have led to
   the depletion of soil organic carbon content and inherent soil fertility
   resulting in a serious threat to the sustainability of these production
   systems. Bioagents like Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus and Trichoderma
   viride have great potential to restore soil fertility and promote
   sugarcane growth. Field experiments, therefore, have been conducted to
   study the integrated effect of bioagents (G. diazotrophicus and T
   viride), Farm Yard Manure (FYM) and fertilizer N on sugarcane
   rhizosphere, crop yield and N economy for two crop cycles during
   2004-2006 and 2005-2007 crop seasons at Lucknow, in the middle
   Indo-Gangetic plain region. Both bioagents could survive and colonize
   sugarcane rhizosphere and FYM improved their colonization. Enhanced soil
   microbial population and microbial carbon (SMC) and nitrogen (SMN) with
   increasing N level were probably due to more available N in the soil.
   FYM/bioagents amendment further enhanced the microbial carbon. The
   uniform increase in the fraction of SMC and SMN of total organic carbon
   indicated that immobilization/mineralization was being maintained in the
   soil where enhanced microbial biomass might act later as a source of
   nutrients.
   Bioagents ammended FYM enhanced the uptake of N, P and K in sugarcane at
   all the levels of fertilizer N. It was mainly due to the enhanced
   nutrient availability in the rhizospheric soil as the soil organic C and
   available N, P and K content increased with the application of
   bioagents/FYM. A saving of 76.3 kg N ha(-1) was envisaged by the use of
   G. diazotrophicus inoculated FYM with marginal (2.4 t ha(-1)) decline in
   the cane yield. Application of T. viride enriched FYM, however, brought
   economy in the use of fertilizer N by 45.2 kg ha(-1) and also increased
   the yield by 6.1 t ha(-1) compared to the control treatment. Overall,
   strategic planning in terms of an integrated application of these
   bioagents/manures with fertilizer N will not only sustain soil fertility
   but will also benefit farmers in terms of reducing their dependence and
   expenditure on chemical fertilizers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted during 2003-07 to find a suitable crop
   nutrition module for organic sugarcane production with green manure
   (Sesbania aculeata L.)-rice (Oryza sativa L.)-plant sugarcane-ratoon
   cropping system for 2 crop cycles. In all, 5 organic nutrition modules
   involving combinations of organic amendments (sulphitation pressmud and
   farmyard manure), legume intercrop lentil (Lens culinaris L.) and
   endophytic/associative diazotrophs (Gluconacetobactor diazotrophicus and
   Azotobactor chroococum) were tested against control (no manure or
   fertilizer). Results revealed that supply of nutrients to sugarcane
   through combined use of sulphitation pressmud 10 tonnes/ha + farmyard
   manure 10 tonnes/ha gave the highest cane yield (84.6 and 74.2 tonnes/ha
   for plant and ratoon cane). The treatment also effected significant
   improvement in soil health at the end of rotation as indicated by 35.2\%
   increase in organic carbon, 158.4\% increase in microbial biomass carbon
   and 118.9\% enhancement in soil microbial biomass nitrogen. Besides, the
   organic nutrition modules resulted in significant increase in the
   contribution of microbial carbon to soil organic carbon varying from
   5.95 to 6.97\% against 3.11\% of initial value. Soil physical properties
   were also enhanced as bulk density reduced from 1.34 Mg/m(3) to 1.25
   Mg/m(3) or less, water stable aggregates swelled from 0.349 mm diameter
   to 0.387 mm or more under organic nutrition modules at ratoon harvest.
   However, farmyard manure 20 tonnes/ha + Trichoderma viride + lentil
   intercropping (1: 2) proved most profitable (B: C ratio 2.7) for planted
   crop and sulphitation pressmud 10 tonnes/ha + farmyard manure 10
   tonnes/ha for ratoon crop (B: C ratio 3.0).}},

Abstract = {{The use of extended rotations to maintain soil health and overall
   Sustainable agricultural practices were evaluated under commercial
   organic potato (Solanum tuberosum L) production systems in Atlantic
   Canada. A 2-year study quantified the changes in soil health for each
   phase of 5-year potato/grain/forage rotations at four organic potato
   production sites. Changes in soil (0-15 cm) physical and chemical (bulk
   density, light fraction organic matter (LFOM), pH, total organic C (TOC)
   and N), and biological properties (microbial biomass C (MBC), microbial
   quotient (MBC/TOC), mineralizable C, metabolic quotient (qCO(2)),
   earthworm (abundance and biomass)) were assessed. Long-term permanent
   pastures at each site served as reference fields. Rotation phase was
   found to have had no significant affect oil soil physical and chemical
   properties. In contrast, soil biological properties were negatively
   affected by the potato phase but recovered to reference field levels
   over the rotation length in both years. The potato phase significantly
   decreased the MBC (297.4 and 217.9 mu g C g(-1) Soil), Microbial
   quotient (1.48 and 1.28\%), earthworm abundance (73.5 and 31.2 m(-2))
   and biomass (32.15 and 12.15 g m(-2)) in 2006 and 2007, respectively.
   MBC in 2006 returned to levels found in the reference fields (780.7 mu g
   C g(-1) soil) after 3 years (627.0 mu g C g(-1) soil) in the rotation,
   however was unable to obtain reference field levels (621.6 mu g C g(-1)
   soil) in 2007. Microbial quotient reached comparable levels to the
   reference fields (3.69 and 2.80\%) after 3 years (2.85\%) and 4 years
   (2.79\%) in rotation in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Mineralizable C was
   significantly affected by rotation phase in 1 year only, but this Was
   not reflected in the metabolic quotient. Earthworm biomass recovered to
   reference field levels (215.44 and 158.21 g m(2)) after 3 years (152.00
   g m(2)) and 4 years (156.93 g m(2)) in 2006 and 2007, respectively.
   Earthworm abundance consistently required 4 years (450.30 and 434.29
   m(2)) in rotation to recover (493.5 and 445 8 m(2)). Overall, results
   Suggest that the extended rotations used in organic potato production
   systems retain soil organic matter and allow recovery of key attributes
   of soil health following the potato phase. Soil biological properties
   appear to be more sensitive indicators of these changes. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Hairy galinsoga {[}Galinsoga ciliata (Raf.) Blake] has become a
   troublesome weed in vegetable crops. Field studies were conducted in
   2006 and 2007 in central New York to determine the effects of: 1)
   spring-sown cover crops on hairy galinsoga growth and seed production
   during cover crop growth grown before subsequent short duration
   vegetable crops; and 2) cover crop residues on establishment of hairy
   galinsoga and four short-duration vegetable crops planted after cover
   crop incorporation. The cover crops {[}buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum
   Moench), brown mustard (Brassica juncea L.), yellow mustard (Sinapis
   alba L.), and oats (Avena sativa L.)] were planted in May and
   incorporated in early July. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and Swiss chard
   {[}Beta vulgaris var. cicla (L.) K. Kochi were transplanted and pea
   (Pisum sativum L.) and snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were sown
   directly into freshly incorporated residues. Above-ground dry biomass
   produced by the cover crops was 4.2, 6.4, 6.8, and 9.7 mg-ha(-1) for
   buckwheat, brown mustard, yellow mustard, and oats, respectively. Cover
   crops alone reduced the dry weight (90\% to 99\%) and seed production of
   hairy galinsoga (98\%) during the cover crop-growing season compared
   with weedy controls. In 2006, only yellow mustard residue suppressed
   hairy galinsoga emergence (53\%). However, in 2007, all cover crop
   residues reduced hairy galinsoga emergence (38\% to 62\%) and biomass
   production (25\% to 60\%) compared with bare soil, with yellow mustard
   providing the greatest suppression. Cover crop residues did not affect
   snap bean emergence, but reduced pea emergence 25\% to 75\%. All
   vegetable crops were suppressed by all cover crop residues with crops
   ranked as: pea > Swiss chard >= lettuce > snap bean in terms of
   sensitivity. The C:N ratios were 8.5, 18.3, 22.9, and 24.8 for
   buckwheat, brown mustard, yellow mustard, and oat residues,
   respectively. Decomposition rate and nitrogen release of brown mustard
   and buckwheat residues was rapid; it was slow for oats and yellow
   mustard residues. Spring-sown cover crops can contribute to weed
   management by reducing seed production, emergence, and growth of hairy
   galinsoga in subsequent crops, but crop emergence and growth may be
   compromised. Yellow mustard and buckwheat sown before late-planted snap
   beans deserve further testing as part of an integrated strategy for
   managing weeds while building soil health.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined air pollution effects on soil health applying
   microbiological parameters. It was carried out near the Angren heavy
   industry complex in a semiarid region of Uzbekistan. This area was
   selected in order to establish a national monitoring program for
   assessing environmental condition of areas remote but downwind from
   greater emission sources. Moreover, little information exists about how
   air pollution affects microbiological functioning of soils in semiarid
   and arid regions of the world, and especially those of Central Asia.
   Soil samples were collected in May 2005 along a 20-km NE-SW river valley
   transect downwind from the industrial complex. Soil chemical analyses
   included electrical conductivity, pH, water soluble Na, Ca, and K, total
   soluble nitrogen, and mineralizable nitrogen content upon a 1:2
   digestion by deionized water. Major elements and heavy metal inventory
   in solids was measured by X-ray fluorescence and atomic absorption
   spectrometry. Microbiological ecosystem properties were assessed by
   biological indicators such as basal respiration (R (B)), microbial
   biomass related C and N contents, and microbial community functioning
   coefficients like the metabolic quotient qCO(2).
   There was a significant spatial dependence and differences for all soil
   chemical and microbiological parameters tested. The highest contents
   were found for the relatively volatile metals Zn (a parts per thousand
   currency sign1,136 mg/kg) and Pb (a parts per thousand currency sign373
   mg/kg) in upper soil layers near the power station suggesting that the
   metal pollutants are derived from local stack emissions. Soil microflora
   was obviously affected by heavy metals. Significant positive
   correlations (p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per
   thousand 0.001) were found between the metal content, R (B), and qCO(2),
   while a negative one was found for the mineralizable N and C (mic)/C
   (org) ratio. A high total number of nematodes was found only most
   distant from the industrial emission sources.
   The results disclosed remarkable spatial dependence not only of the
   heavy metal impact onto the soil but also of microbiological soil
   properties in the study area. The latter suggests bioavailability of the
   anthropogenic metals in the soil affecting the soil microbial community.
   This is suggested by less biomass formation and higher qCO(2) values in
   heavy metal-contaminated compared to less-polluted soil plots.
   Knowledge of these spatial ecosystem functioning patterns and dependence
   could be very useful in determining and delineating specific land use
   and management programs that would be suited and feasible for the highly
   polluted area. Results of this study can be utilized to develop a
   monitoring program that may quantify harmful effects on the soil health
   and impact of any future remediation activities.
   Studies on the relationship between soil biota and pollution levels have
   raised the question regarding the status of natural soil microbial
   health, stressing the importance of background data of environmental
   conditions, and elucidating the importance of this environmental
   monitoring approach even in semiarid and arid regions. Soil
   microbiological parameters, in particular the metabolic quotient qCO(2)
   as one of the most sensitive bioindicators identified for that region,
   should clearly become part of the national environmental monitoring
   program.}},

Abstract = {{Lynch, D. 2009. Environmental impacts of organic agriculture: A Canadian
   perspective. Can. J. Plant Sci. 89: 621-628. Canada, in 2009, will enact
   a regulatory regime to oversee certified organic agricultural
   productions systems, based on a management standard. The overreaching
   goal of that standard is to develop farm enterprises that are
   ``sustainable and harmonious with the environment{''}. However,
   empirical evidence to shed light on claims of environmental benefits
   from organic agriculture is particularly scarce in Canada and North
   America generally, and has not been comprehensively summarized. This
   review examines the literature of Canadian and US studies which relate
   to environmental impacts of organic agriculture within the selected
   indicators of: (i) soil organic matter storage and soil quality/soil
   health; (ii) plant and wildlife biodiversity; (iii) energy use; (iv)
   nutrient loading and off-farm nutrient losses; and (v) climate change
   and greenhouse gas emissions. The empirical evidence presented suggests
   organic farming system attributes regarding cropping, floral, and
   habitat diversity, nutrient intensity, soil management, energy and
   pesticide use, etc., are sufficiently distinct as to impart potentially
   important environmental benefits across the indicator categories
   examined. However, on average, crop yields under organic management
   regimes continue to lag behind those obtained by conventional management
   systems. More research is needed to validate these results, for the
   benefit of producers, consumers and policy makers as they decide the
   relative importance and contribution of organic farming systems to the
   Canadian food marketplace and agrifood sector.}},

Abstract = {{The Sunshine Farm, in central Kansas, offers a unique data set detailing
   all the inputs and outputs of a farming project intended to be based, as
   much as possible, on solar energy. Such a complete and detailed data
   set, encompassing more than 1.25 M data points for an 85-ha, 7-year
   project, has never before been compiled for an), farm. The data show
   that important energy inputs that have thus far been left out of
   existing farm energy efficiency estimates, with implications for
   biofuels and other biomass for energy technologies. The SSF achieved
   energy efficiencies superior to conventional agriculture while
   maintaining soil health and delivering more nutritious, organic
   products. A first-ever analysis of the energy efficiency of horse
   traction shows that horses are significantly less energy efficient and
   much less labor efficient than tractors, although the horses in the
   study were clearly underutilized. An analysis of the farm removing all
   inputs and outputs relevant to the horses shows that without horses the
   Sunshine Farm would have been competitive with conventional energy
   efficiencies even taking into account the farm's higher labor inputs and
   small size.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we assess what is known or anticipated about
   environmental and sustainability factors associated with next-generation
   biofuels relative to the primary conventional biofuels (i.e., corn
   grain-based ethanol and soybean-based diesel) in the United State during
   feedstock production and conversion processes. Factor considered include
   greenhouse (GHG) emissions air pollutant emissions, soil health and
   quality, water use and water quality, wastewater and solid waste
   streams, and biodiversity add land-use changes. Based on our review of
   the available literature, we find that the. production of
   next-generation feedstocks in the U.S. (e.g., municipal solid waste,
   forest residues, dedicated energy crops, microalgae) are expected to
   fare better than corn-grain or soybean production on most of these
   factors, although the magnitude of these differences may vary
   significantly among feedstocks. Ethanol produced using a biochemical or
   thermochemical conversion platform is expected to result in fewer GHG
   and air pollutant emissions, but to have similar or potentially greater
   water demands and solid waste streams than conventional ethanol
   biorefineries in the U.S. However, these conversion-related differences
   are likely to be small, particularly relative to those associated with
   feedstock production. Modeling performed for illustrative purposes and
   to allow for standardized quantitative comparisons across feedstocks and
   conversion technologies generally confirms the findings from the
   literature.. Despite current expectations, significant uncertainty
   remains regarding how well next-generation biofuels will fare on
   different environmental and sustainability factors when produced on a
   commercial scale in the U.S. Additional research is needed in several
   broad areas including quantifying impacts, designing standardized
   metrics and approaches, and developing decision-support to identify and
   quantify environmental trade-offs and ensure sustainable biofuels
   production.}},

Abstract = {{Living mulch cover crops can improve soil health and build organic
   matter, yet their use in fruit orchards comes with a risk of encouraging
   meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), a rodent that can be destructive
   to fruit trees. Several living mulch cover crop species were assessed in
   an apple (Malus xdomestica) orchard understory along with wood chip
   mulch and bare ground. Desired species characteristics were weed
   competitiveness, low growth habit, nitrogen fixation, and potential
   rodent repellency. Legume species included birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus
   corniculatus), medic (Medicago spp.), and subterranean clover (Trifolium
   subterraneum), which were planted in solid stands as well as mixtures.
   Nonlegume species included sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum), sweet
   alyssum (Lobularia maritima), creeping thyme (Thymus serpyllum), and
   colonial bentgrass (Agrostis tenuis). Meadow vole presence was evaluated
   in fall and spring with point-intersect and run-length measurements. A
   legume mix (medic, birdsfoot trefoil, subterranean clover, and colonial
   bentgrass) had the highest meadow vole presence, with no reduction under
   the ``sandwich{''} system of tilling either side of the tree trunks
   while leaving a cover crop in a narrow strip with the trunks. The
   nonlegume mix {[}colonial bentgrass, sweet alyssum, creeping thyme, and
   fivespot (Neomophila maculata)] had similar results. However, the sweet
   woodruff (planted in the ``sandwich{''} system) had significantly lower
   presence of meadow voles than the other living mulches. Wood chip mulch,
   cultivation, and bare ground control were all similar, with very low
   presence, indicating low risk of meadow vole damage. The results from
   the sweet woodruff suggest that we need more research on the potential
   to select living mulches that are nonattractive or repellent to meadow
   voles for use in orchards.}},

   Influence of 10 years of conservation tillage on some biological
   properties of a fine sandy loam in the potato phase of two crop
   rotations in Atlantic Canada. Can. J. Soil Sci. 89: 391-402.
   Conservation practices in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cropping systems
   can reduce excess tillage, provide crop residue cover, and maintain crop
   productivity; however, little is known about their long-term influence
   on soil biota and biological properties. Conservation tillage was
   evaluated in two potato rotations: a 2-yr barley-potato rotation and
   3-yr clover-based (barley-red clover-potato) rotation initiated in 1994
   on a fine sandy loam (Orthic Podzol) in Prince Edward Island, eastern
   Canada. Soil samples were obtained in 2003 from the 0- to 10-cm soil
   depth of the potato phase of both rotations to evaluate the influence of
   conservation, compared with conventional tillage, on changes in soil
   fertility, soil structural properties, soil C and N fractions,
   soil-borne pathogens, nematode communities, and micro-arthropod
   (Collembola and Acari) communities. The 3-yr conservation tillage
   practice improved soil structural stability, increased soil extractable
   P and K, increased soil organic C and total N and their particulate
   fractions, compared with the other treatments. Comparisons with earlier
   studies indicated that soil organic C had reached an equilibrium level
   at the 0- to 10-cm soil depth. Reduction of potato disease caused by
   Rhizoctonia solani was evident in the 3-yr rotation, compared with the
   2-yr rotation, but was not influenced by tillage practice. Plant
   parasitic nematodes were not greatly influenced by rotation and tillage
   treatments; however, densities of the beneficial bacterial-feeding
   nematodes were increased under the 3-yr conservation tillage treatment.
   The abundance of micro-arthropods was increased by conservation tillage,
   while their diversity was mainly influenced by the rotation cycle rather
   than tillage practice. Overall, the 3-yr conservation tillage treatment
   provided a more beneficial soil biological condition than the other
   treatments, especially when compared with the 2-yr conventional tillage
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Soil microbial populations can fluctuate in response to environmental
   changes and, therefore, are often used as biological indicators of soil
   quality. Soil chemical and physical parameters can also be used as
   indicators because they can vary in response to different management
   strategies. A long-term field trial was conducted to study the effects
   of different tillage systems (NT: no tillage, DH: disc harrow, and MP:
   moldboard plough), P fertilization (diammonium phosphate), and cattle
   grazing (in terms of crop residue consumption) in maize (Zea mays L.),
   sunflower (Heliantus annuus L.), and soybean (Glycine max L.) on soil
   biological, chemical, and physical parameters. The field trial was
   conducted for four crop years (2000/2001, 2001/2002, 2002/2003, and
   2003/2004). Soil populations of Actinomycetes, Trichoderma spp., and
   Gliocladium spp. were 49\% higher under conservation tillage systems, in
   soil amended with diammonium phosphate (DAP) and not previously grazed.
   Management practices also influenced soil chemical parameters,
   especially organic matter content and total N, which were 10\% and 55\%
   higher under NT than under MP. Aggregate stability was 61\% higher in NT
   than in MP, 15\% higher in P-fertilized soil, and also 9\% higher in not
   grazed strips, bulk density being 12\% lower in NT systems compared with
   MP. DAP application and the absence of grazing also reduced bulk density
   (3\%). Using conservation tillage systems, fertilizing crops with DAP,
   and avoiding grazing contribute to soil health preservation and enhanced
   crop production.}},

Abstract = {{The use of microorganisms as bioindicators of soil health is quite a new
   feature, rarely considered for the soil health evaluation in
   chronically-polluted industrial sites, and still suffering of the bias
   related to the technique applied.
   In this work we applied a microbiological polyphasic approach, relying
   on soil indigenous microorganisms as bioindicators and combining
   culture-dependent and -independent methods, in order to evaluate soil
   health of four sites (1a, 1b, 2a and 2b) inside a chemical factory with
   a centenary activity. Functional as well as structural aspects were
   comprehensively considered. Results were related to the kind of
   pollutants found in each site.
   Heavy metal pollution was recorded in sites 1b and 2b, while both
   organic and inorganic substances were detected in sites 1a and 2a. Based
   on the chemical and physical properties of the four soils, site 1b and
   2b grouped together, while 1a and 2a were separated from the others.
   The density of the culturable bacteria was very low in site 2a, where
   only Gram-positive were found. According to the identification of
   culturable bacteria, site 2a showed the lowest similarity with the other
   sites. Microbial activity was detected only in sites 1b and 2b. PCR-DGGE
   (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis), was performed on the
   culturable, total and active microbial communities. Consistently with
   the identification of culturable bacterial strains, the molecular
   profile of the culturable fraction of site 2a, was clearly separated
   from the molecular profiles of other sites in cluster analysis.
   Molecular fingerprintings of the whole and active bacterial communities
   differed among the sites, but clustered according to the pollutants
   present in each site. The presence of possible key species in each site
   has been discussed according to the whole and active species.
   Since the results obtained by microbiological analysis are consistent
   with the chemical data, we suggest that the use of this microbiological
   polyphasic approach and of microorganisms as intrinsic bioindicators,
   can be suitable for the evaluation of soil health. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Intercropping can enhance yields and reduce pest infestations, but
   investigations of intercropping regimes using crop species common to the
   large-scale monoculture production systems of western Canada have not
   examined these diverse elements. Intercrops of canola (Brassica napus
   L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were established at three sites in
   Alberta, Canada in 2005 and 2006 to determine interactions between
   intercropping regimes and crop grain and biomass yield, crop quality
   characteristics, soil microbial community biomass and diversity, flea
   beetles (Phyllotreta spp., Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), and wheat leaf
   diseases. The study also investigated effects on flea beetles and soil
   microbial communities of a canola seed treatment containing a
   neonicotinoid insecticide and fungicides. Crop yields were comparable
   between intercrops and monocultures of canola and wheat. Crop quality
   characteristics and flea beetle feeding damage to canola seedlings had
   variable responses to intercropping. Flea beetle feeding was reduced
   with the inclusion of the seed treatment by between I and 20\% damaged
   leaf area, although only one site-year had damage levels great enough to
   overcome plant compensatory abilities in untreated plots. The first
   true-leaf stage of canola development experienced the greatest flea
   beetle damage. Proportions of pathogen-infected wheat leaf tissue were
   up to 2.5 times greater in intercrops than wheat monocultures but tended
   to decrease as the proportion of canola in the intercrops increased.
   Soil microbial parameters were unaffected by factors investigated.
   Although intercrop yields approximated those of monocultures, additional
   benefits of canola-wheat intercrops determined in this stud), appear
   insufficient to recommend this system for widespread adoption.}},

Abstract = {{The negative impact of continuous production on soil productivity has
   been demonstrated but is not well understood. The impacts of
   continuous-pea on soil health and functioning, as compared to pea-wheat
   rotation, were assessed as part of an 11-year study conducted on a thin
   Black Chernozemic soil to understand how crop rotation affects soil
   microbial communities, nutrient availability, and pea nutrition and
   productivity. Soil and plants from the field pea phase of the rotations
   receiving one of three nitrogen treatments (0, 20,40 kg N ha(-1)) were
   sampled three times during the growing season of 2005. Reduction in pea
   plant productivity in the continuous-pea system seemed attributable to
   multiple causes. In continuous-pea, tissue N and P concentrations were
   reduced by over 10\%, and tissue Fe and Mn concentrations were increased
   2- and 1.7-fold, respectively. High tissue micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu,
   and Zn) concentration was related with the abundance of the Gram
   negative bacteria phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarker 2OH-14:0. In
   the continuous-pea rotation, the soil microbial community was smaller,
   the abundance of beneficial Gram positive bacteria and arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) fungi was reduced as indicated by phospholipids fatty
   acid biomarkers, and the percentage of AM root colonization was lower.
   These differences in soil microbial biodiversity could be related with
   increased susceptibility of continuous-pea to root rot injury, as
   continuous-pea root abundance was reduced 2-fold as compared to
   pea-wheat rotation. Fusariurn root rot was more severe in the
   continuous-pea than pea-wheat rotation (assessed in 2001 and 2008).
   Depressed soil organic carbon level, and dehydrogenase, phosphatase and
   urease activity in continuous-pea. revealed a negative impact of
   continuous-pea on nutrient cycling. Greater residual NO(3) level in the
   soil profile indicated inefficient use of N and increased risk of N
   leaching with continuous-pea. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Rhizosphere is a site with complex interactions between the root and
   associated microorganisms and high microbial diversity. Plant
   growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are free-living, root colonizing,
   soil- borne bacteria exert phytostimulatory actions, when applied to
   seeds or crops by a combination of physiological attributes. Soil
   microorganisms play a very important role in maintaining soil health,
   ecosystem functions and crop productivity. So far, only a few
   eco-toxicological studies of nanotechnological products have been
   published. The present report is a review of scientific results on the
   potential negative or positive impact of engineered metal nanoparticles
   on the rhizobacteria. Here, we evaluated the effects of metal
   nanoparticles like as fullerens, gold, silver, aluminium and others on
   the PGPR. Altogether, the study suggests that metal nanoparticle could
   significantly produce ecotoxicity and killing of phytostimulatory soil
   bacteria. Thus, the engineered nanoparticle (ENPs) should be further
   tested as a possible ecofriendly agent.}},

Abstract = {{A phytostabilization process that combined the addition of a synthetic
   (Calcinit + urea + PK14\% + Calcium carbonate) or organic (cow slurry)
   amendment with Lolium perenne L. growth was used to remediate a mine
   soil moderately contaminated with Zn, Pb, and Cd. The reduced toxicity
   caused by both amendments allowed the establishment of a healthy L.
   perenne vegetation cover that had a positive influence on soil
   properties, increasing the biomass, activity, and functional diversity
   of the soil microbial community. The beneficial effects of
   phytostabilization on soil properties were more accentuated in
   organically amended than in synthetically amended soils. Root-to-shoot
   translocation factors were smaller in amended versus control plants,
   indicating a reduction in the risk of metals entering the food chain
   through phytostabilization. The sensitivity, rapid response, and
   integrative character of biological indicators of soil health make them
   valuable tools for assessing the efficiency of metal phytostabilization
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the response of soil quality indicators to changes in
   management practices is essential for sustainable land management. Soil
   quality indicators were measured for 2 years under established
   experiments with varying management histories and durations at four
   locations in New York State. The Willsboro (clay loam) and Aurora (silt
   loam) experiments were established in 1992, comparing no-till (NT) to
   plow-till (PT) management under corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max
   L.) rotation. The Chazy (silt loam) trial was established in 1973 as a
   factorial experiment comparing NT versus PT and the crop harvesting
   method (corn silage versus corn grain). The Geneva (silt loam)
   experiment was established in 2003 with vegetable rotations with and
   without intervening soil building crops, each under three tillage
   methods (NT, PT and zone-till (ZT)) and three cover cropping systems
   (none, rye and vetch). Physical indicators measured were wet aggregate
   stability (WAS), available water capacity (AWC) and surface hardness
   (SH) and subsurface hardness (SSH). Soil biological indicators included
   organic matter (OM), active carbon (AC), potentially mineralizable
   nitrogen (PMN) and root disease potential (RDP). Chemical indicators
   included pH, P, K, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn. Results from the Willsboro and
   Aurora sites showed significant tillage effects for several indicators
   including WAS, AWC, OM, AC, pH, P, K, Mg, Fe and Mn. Generally, the NT
   treatment had better indicator values than the PT treatments. At the
   Chazy site, WAS, AWC, OM, AC, pH, K and Mg showed significant
   differences for tillage and/or harvest method, also with NT showing
   better indicator values compared to PT and corn grain better than corn
   silage. Aggregate stability was on average 2.5 times higher in NT
   compared to PT treatments at Willsboro, Aurora and Chazy sites. OM was
   also 1.2, 1.1 and 1.5 times higher in NT compared to PT treatments at
   Willsboro, Aurora and Chazy sites, respectively. At the Geneva site WAS,
   SH, AC, PMN, pH, P, K and Zn showed significant tillage effects. The
   cover crop effect was only significant for SH and PMN measurements.
   Indicators that gave consistent performance across locations included
   WAS, OM and AC, while PMN and RDP were site and management dependent.
   The composite soil health index (CSHI) significantly differentiated
   between contrasting management practices. The CSHI for the Willsboro,
   site was 71\% for NT and 59\% for PT, while at the Aurora site it was
   61\% for NT and 48\% for PT after 15 years of tillage treatments.}},

Abstract = {{A three-month microcosm study was carried out in order to evaluate: (i)
   the capacity of sorghum plants to phytoextract Cd (50 mg kg(-1)) and Zn
   (1000 mg kg(-1)) from artificially polluted soil and (ii) the
   possibility of biomonitoring the efficiency of phytoremediation using
   parameters related to the size, activity and functional diversity of the
   soil microbial community. Apart from plant and soil (total and
   bioavailable) metal concentrations, the following parameters were
   determined: soil physicochemical properties (pH, OM content, electrical
   conductivity, total N. and extractable P and K), dehydrogenase activity,
   basaland substrate-induced respiration (with glucose and a model
   rhizodeposit solution, both adjusted to 800 mg C kg(-1) DW soil and 45.2
   mg N kg(-1) DW soil), microbial respiration quotient, functional
   diversity through community level physiological profiles and, finally,
   seed germination toxicity tests with Lepidium sativum. Sorghum plants
   were highly tolerant to metal pollution and capable of reaching high
   biomass values in the presence of metals. In the first two harvests,
   values of shoot Cd concentrations were higher than 100 mg Cd kg(-1) DW,
   the threshold value for hyperaccumulators. Nonetheless, in the third
   harvest, the bioconcentration factor was 1.34 and 0.35 for Cd and Zn,
   respectively, well below the threshold value of 10 considered for a
   phytoextraction process to be feasible. In general, microbial parameters
   showed lower values in metal polluted than in control non-polluted
   soils, and higher values in planted than in control unplanted pots. As a
   result of the phytoextraction process, which includes both plant growth
   and metal phytoextraction. the functioning of the phytoremediated soil,
   as reflected by the values of the different microbial parameters here
   determined, was restored. Most importantly, although the phytoextracted
   soil recovered its function, it was still more phytotoxic than the
   control non-polluted soil. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years conventional production technologies in the rice-wheat
   (RW) system have been leading to deterioration of soil health and
   declining farm profitability due to high inputs of water and labour.
   Conservation agriculture (CA)-based resource-conserving technologies
   (RCTs) vis-a-vis zero-till (ZT), raised-bed planting and direct-seeded
   rice (DSR) have shown promise as alternatives to conventional production
   technologies to overcome these problems. The integration of CA-based
   RCTs with precision agriculture (PA)-based technologies in a systems
   perspective could provide a better option for sustainable RW production
   systems. In this study we attempted to evaluate conservation and
   precision agriculture (CPA)-based RCTs as a double-ZT system integrated
   with laser-assisted precision land leveling (PLL) in the RW system. A
   field experiment was conducted in the western IGP for 2 years to
   evaluate various tillage and crop establishment methods under PLL and
   traditional land leveling (TLL) practices to improve water productivity,
   economic profitability and soil physical quality. Irrespective of
   tillage and crop establishment methods (TCE), PLL improved RW system
   productivity by 7.4\% in year 2 as compared to traditional land
   leveling. Total irrigation water savings under PLL versus TLL were
   12-14\% in rice and 10-13\% in wheat. PLL improved RW system
   profitability by US\$113 ha(-1) (year 1) to \$175 ha(-1) (year 2).
   Yields were higher in conventionally transplanted rice followed by
   direct-drill-seeded rice after ZT. In wheat, yields were higher in ZT
   when followed by DSR than in the conventional-till (CT) system. RW
   system productivity under double ZT was equivalent to that of the
   conventional method. Among different TCE, conventional
   puddled-transplanted rice-CT wheat required 12-33\% more water than
   other TCE techniques. Compared with CT systems, double ZT consumed
   12-20\% less water with almost equal system productivity and
   demonstrated higher water productivity. The CT system had higher bulk
   density and penetration resistance in 10-15 and 15-20 cm soil layers due
   to compaction caused by the repeated wet tillage in rice. The
   steady-state infiltration rate and soil aggregation (>0.25 mm) were
   higher under permanent beds and double ZT and lower in the CT system.
   Under CT, soil aggregation was static across seasons, whereas it
   improved under double no-till and permanent beds. Similarly, mean weight
   diameter of aggregates was higher under double ZT and permanent beds and
   increased over time. The study reveals that to sustain the RW system,
   CPA-based RCTs could be more viable options: however, the long-term
   effects of these alternative technologies need to be studied under
   varying agro-ecologies. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In India, current fertilizer recommendations are very old and developed
   based on agro-climatic zones. The assumption is that agro-climatic zones
   are homogenous units. However, analyses of agro-climatic zones reveal
   variability in soil within each zone. Current agro-climatic zonal
   fertilizer recommendations are generalized for entire zone and not
   addressed to specific soil types. To know the soil variability within
   the National Agricultural Research Project (NARP) agro-climate zone and
   suitability of current fertilizer recommendations, sugarcane in northern
   dry zone of Karnataka was studied as a test crop. The results indicated
   that agro-climatic zones vary widely in soils and in their potentials,
   behaviour and response to management. It was also observed that
   fertilizer application efficiency varied within each zone and within the
   management units. These differences contributed to errors of both excess
   and insufficient applications. Besides, there is a continuous removal of
   secondary and micronutrients by crops in all farming situations
   resulting in inappropriate management practices. All these suggest that
   soil-based fertilizer recommendations should be preferred to achieve
   precision in farming and to maximize crop production, maintain soil
   health and minimize fertilizer misapplication.}},

Abstract = {{The choice of cultivation system in arable agriculture exerts a strong
   influence not only on soil health and crop productivity but also on the
   wider environment. Conservation tillage using non-inversion methods
   conserves soil carbon, reduces erosion risk and enhances soil quality.
   In addition, conservation tillage has been shown to sequester more
   carbon within the soil than inversion tillage, reducing carbon dioxide
   losses to the atmosphere. Stable, well structured topsoils that develop
   following long-term conservation tillage lead to more energy efficient
   systems due to the reduced power requirements for cultivation. Long-term
   experiments, e. g. more than 20 years, that confirm the impact of
   conservation tillage over an extended period are not common. Here we
   evaluate the impact of different tillage methods and winter wheat straw
   management, either incorporated or removed, on organic matter turnover
   and soil quality indicators. No-till, chisel and mouldboard ploughing
   was carried out for 23 years on a silty clay loam soil in South West
   England that was not considered suitable for non-inversion tillage due
   to weak soil structure. In order to assess the effect of contrasting
   cultivation and straw disposal method on soil carbon dynamics, a range
   of assays were conducted, including water extractable organic carbon,
   hot water extractable carbohydrate, microbial biomass carbon, activity
   of beta-glucosidase and acid phosphatase enzymes, C sequestration and
   the natural abundance of (13)C. Our results show that the soil organic
   carbon concentration in the topsoil was greater under no-till than
   mouldboard ploughing, while a reverse trend was observed in the lower
   depths. A 14-17\% increase in soil organic carbon was observed in the
   topsoil for chisel plough and no-till treatments compared to mouldboard
   ploughing. Water extractable organic carbon was found to constitute only
   1-7\% of the microbial biomass carbon. Hot water extractable
   carbohydrate was one of the most sensitive indicators of soil quality
   and had a significant a negative correlation with bulk density and
   positive correlation with soil organic carbon microbial biomass carbon
   beta-glucosidase and acid phosphatase. The choice of cultivation method
   exerted a major control on microbial and carbon dynamics. No-till and
   chisel ploughing maintained carbon in the soil surface horizons, which
   will benefit the stability of this weakly structured soil, but
   mouldboard ploughing distributed carbon more uniformly throughout the
   soil profile, particularly when straw was incorporated, hence leading to
   the retention of more carbon in the soil profile.}},

Abstract = {{Central to soil health and plant productivity in natural ecosystems are
   in situ soil microbial communities, of which mycorrhizal fungi are an
   integral component, regulating nutrient transfer between plants and the
   surrounding soil via extensive mycelial networks. Such networks are
   supported by plant-derived carbon and are likely to be enhanced under
   coppiced biomass plantations, a forestry practice that has been
   highlighted recently as a viable means of providing an alternative
   source of energy to fossil fuels, with potentially favourable
   consequences for carbon mitigation. Here, we explore ways in which
   biomass forestry, in conjunction with mycorrhizal fungi, can offer a
   more holistic approach to addressing several topical environmental
   issues, including `carbon-neutral' energy, ecologically sustainable land
   management and CO2 sequestration.}},

Abstract = {{Though in last four decades various alternate energy sources have come
   into the limelight, the hyperbolic use of coal as a prime energy source
   cannot be counterbalanced. Disposal of high amount of fly-ash from
   thermal power plants absorbs huge amount of water, energy and land area
   by ash ponds. In order to meet the growing energy demand, various
   environmental, economic and social problems associated with the disposal
   of fly-ash would continue to increase. Therefore, fly-ash management
   would remain a great concern of the century. Fly-ash has great
   potentiality in agriculture due to its efficacy in modification of soil
   health and crop performance. The high concentration of elements (K, Na,
   Zn, Ca, Mg and Fe) in fly-ash increases the yield of many agricultural
   crops. But compared to other sectors, the use of fly-ash in agriculture
   is limited. An exhaustive review of numerous studies of last four
   decades took place in this paper, which systematically covers the
   importance, scope and apprehension regarding utilization of fly-ash in
   agriculture. The authors concluded that though studies have established
   some solutions to handle the problems of radioactivity and heavy metal
   content in fly-ash, long-term confirmatory research and demonstration
   are necessary. This paper also identified some areas, like proper
   handling of dry ash in plants as well as in fields, ash pond management
   (i.e., faster decantation, recycling of water, vertical expansion rather
   than horizontal), monitoring of soil health, crop quality, and fate of
   fly-ash in time domain, where research thrust is required. Agricultural
   lime application contributes to global warming as Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assumes that all the carbon in
   agricultural lime is finally released as CO(2) to the atmosphere. It is
   expected that use of fly-ash instead of lime in agriculture can reduce
   net CO(2) emission, thus reduce global warming also. (C) 2009 National

Abstract = {{Gypsum and S are applied to soils being irrigated with Na-HCO(3)
   dominated coalbed natural gas (CBNG) produced water to protect soil
   structure and fertility. Wyoming law requires beneficial use of produced
   water and irrigation with CBNG produced water in the semi-arid Powder
   River Basin is becoming more common. Strontium isotopes were used to
   evaluate the effectiveness of the gypsum and S applications in
   preventing sodification of these irrigated soils. The isotope ratio of
   Sr on the cation exchange complex of irrigated soil falls between that
   of the gypsum amendment (0.7074) and that of local soil (0.712-0.713).
   Strontium isotopes indicate that, to a depth of 30 cm, as much as 50\%
   of the Sr on the irrigated soil cation exchange sites originated from
   the applied gypsum amendment on a field irrigated for 3 a. This was also
   true to a depth of 5 cm on a field irrigated less than 1 a. Strontium
   isotope ratio measurements of vegetation illustrate plant utilization of
   Sr from gypsum amendments, thereby reinforcing the conclusions about the
   presence of Sr from gypsum on the soil's exchange sites. This Sr tracing
   technique may be useful in a wide variety of settings where monitoring
   soil health is necessary. especially in settings where poor quality
   water is used for irrigation: a more common occurrence as demand for
   fresh water increases. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement of soil microbial biomass and abundance offers a means of
   assessing the response of all microbial populations to changes in the
   soil environment after a fire. We examined the effects of wildfire on
   microbial biomass C and N, and abundance of bacteria and fungi 2 months
   after a fire in a pine plantation. Soil organic carbon (C-org), total
   nitrogen (N-tot), and electrical conductivity (EC) increased following
   the fire. In terms of microbial abundance, the overall results showed
   that burned forest soils had the most bacteria and fungi. Microbial
   biomass C and N from soil in the burned forest were not significantly
   different from their unburned forest counterparts. However, microbial
   indices indicated that fire affects soil microbial community structure
   by modifying the environmental conditions. The results also suggested
   that low-intensity fire promotes microorganism functional activity and
   improves the chemical characteristics of soils under humid climatic
   conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soils are one of the most important features of the natural capital of
   terrestrial ecosystems. There is a strong and increasing policy
   requirement for effective monitoring of soils at local, regional and
   national-scales. However, it remains unclear which properties of soils
   are most appropriately monitored. This is partly due to the wide range
   of goods and services that soils provide, but also their inherent
   chemical, physical and biological complexity. Given that the biota plays
   such fundamental roles in the majority of ecosystem services provided by
   soils, biological properties are logical candidates as effective
   indicators, to complement soil physico-chemical properties. A plethora
   of biological methods have been suggested as indicators for monitoring
   soils but few are used in national-scale monitoring or are published as
   international standards. A framework for selecting ecologically relevant
   biological indicators of soil quality, for national-scale soil
   monitoring, that cover the range of functions and services of soil was
   devised. The literature was surveyed to identify 183 candidate
   biological indicators which were then scored by experts and stakeholders
   against a wide range of scientific and technical criteria. The framework
   used the scores and weightings; to then rank, prioritise and select the
   indicators. This semi-objective approach using a ``logical sieve{''}
   allowed repeated iterations to take account of end-user requirements and
   expert opinion. A ranked list of 21 indicators was produced that covered
   a range of genotypic-, phenotypic- and functional-based indicators for
   different trophic groups. Four of these were not deemed sufficiently
   robust for ready deployment in a national-scale monitoring scheme
   without further methodological development. The suite of indicators
   identified offers the strongest potential candidates for deployment in
   national-scale soil monitoring schemes. However, standard operating
   procedures, their inherent sensitivity, ability to discriminate between
   soil:land use combinations, ecological interpretation all need to be
   confirmed. The power of the approach adopted here is that it provides a
   clear record and audit trail on the decision-making process, enables
   different priorities to be set contingent on the nature of the desired
   monitoring, and can direct and allow the inclusion of further methods or
   indicators into the framework. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Conservation Agriculture (CA) has been practised for three decades and
   has spread widely. We estimate that there are now some 106 million ha of
   arable and permanent crops grown without tillage in CA systems,
   corresponding to an annual rate of increase globally since 1990 of 5.3
   million ha. Wherever CA has been adopted it appears to have had both
   agricultural and environmental benefits. Yet CA represents a fundamental
   change in production system thinking. It has counterintuitive and often
   unrecognized elements that promote soil health, productive capacity and
   ecosystem services. The practice of CA thus requires a deeper
   understanding of its ecological underpinnings in order to manage its
   various elements for sustainable intensification, where the aim is to
   optimize resource use and protect or enhance ecosystem processes in
   space and time over the long term. For these reasons CA is
   knowledge-intensive. CA constitutes principles and practices that can
   make a major contribution to sustainable production intensification.
   This, the first of two papers, presents the justification for CA as a
   system capable of building sustainability into agricultural production
   systems. It discusses some of CA's major achievable benefits, and
   presents an overview of the uptake of CA worldwide to 2009. The related
   paper elaborates the necessary conditions for the spread of CA.}},

Abstract = {{In aerobic rice, adapted varieties are grown in non-flooded and
   non-saturated soil. In the Philippines, occasional poor crop growth and
   yield failures have been reported. To investigate the underlying causes,
   we conducted 3 pot experiments using the aerobic rice variety Apo and
   so-called ``sick soil{''} from a field where aerobic rice failed in four
   successive dry seasons. The (experimental) aerobic rice crop replaced
   the farmer's practice of wet-season lowland rice and dry season sweet
   potato cropping. We hypothesized that abiotic factors, especially the
   inter-relationship between high soil pH and impaired micronutrient
   uptake, restrict plant growth, and that ammonium sulfate has an
   ameliorating effect. Experiment I used ``sick soil{''} collected from
   around yellowing and dying plants in a field experiment with aerobic
   rice yield failure, and ``healthy soil{''} collected from around
   well-growing plants in the same field. We used three N fertilizer
   treatments (ammonium sulfate, urea, no application) and two soil water
   conditions (well drained and water-logged). In experiment 2, the
   treatments were a combination of sick and healthy soil, N fertilizer,
   soil acidification, and foliar application of Fe. Experiment 3 compared
   the irrigation water used at the experimental field site with
   reverse-osmosis water. Irrigation with water from the field site
   increased soil pH, impaired plant growth, and induced chlorosis. The
   application of ammonium sulfate reduced soil pH to values below 6 and
   increased plant micronutrient (Fe, Mn and Zn) contents and plant growth.
   In early vegetative plant growth, the high soil pH appeared to be the
   key determinant of ``sick soil{''}, while root knot nematodes were most
   likely secondary causes for poor plant growth. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Several rhizobacteria play a vital role in plant protection, plant
   growth promotion and the improvement of soil health. In this study, we
   have isolated a strain of Lysobacter antibioticus HS124 from rhizosphere
   and demonstrate its antifungal activity against various pathogens
   including Phytophthora capsici, a destructive pathogen of pepper plants.
   L. antibioticus HS124 produced lytic enzymes such as chitinase,
   beta-1,3-glucanase, lipase, protease, and an antibiotic compound. This
   antibiotic compound was purified by diaion HP-20, silica gel, sephadex
   LH-20 column chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography.
   The purified compound was identified as 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid by
   gas chromatography-electron ionization (GC-EI) and gas
   chromatography-chemical ionization (GC-CI) mass spectrometry. This
   antibiotic exhibited destructive activity toward P. capsici hyphae. In
   vivo experiments utilizing green house grown pepper plants demonstrated
   the protective effect of L. antibioticus HS124 against P. capsici. The
   growth of pepper plants treated with L. antibioticus culture was
   enhanced, resulting in greater protection from fungal disease. Optimum
   growth and protection was found when cultures were grown in presence of
   Fe(III). Additionally, the activities of pathogenesis-related proteins
   such as chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase decreased in roots, but
   increased in leaves with time after treatment compared to controls. Our
   results demonstrate L. antibioticus HS124 as a promising candidate for
   biocontrol of P. capsici in pepper plants.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that spatial variations
   in soil microbial variables in a Thai rice paddy are accurately
   described by multivariate profiles of the soil bacterial communities. We
   found that community-level physiological profiles of soil bacterial
   communities could better describe the population density of Rhizoctonia
   solani in soil than the physicochemical profiles do. However, soil
   dehydrogenase levels were closely correlated with soil fertility (P <
   0.05), and these were better described by the physicochemical profiles.
   Hence, the hypothesis was rejected, and we suspect that soil microbial
   variables react differently to the same physicochemical changes. The
   average population density of R. solani (35 colony-forming units/g dry
   soil) was relatively high in the soil we studied, and the soil fertility
   was found to be among the poorest in Thailand. The soil quality was
   comparable to the most degraded bare ground soil in an adjacent
   bioreserve in terms of Shannon diversity index based on the
   communitylevel physiological profile as well as values of soil fertility
   indices. Overall, the soil microbial and physicochemical indicators
   showed that the paddy soil needs to be supplemented with soil nutrients.
   Otherwise, R. solani may cause a significant reduction in rice
   production.}},

Abstract = {{To make our modem agriculture successful, the use of new agricultural
   technology in a short span of 35-40 years have caused havoc by
   contaminating our soil, environment and food with toxic pesticides
   residues. Modem agriculture is exploitive of growth resources and has
   caused very serious problems such as environmental pollution through
   (i). contamination of underground drinking water resources, food and
   fodder with pesticides and nitrates, which are harmful to 0 human beings
   and livestock, (ii). poor soil health/soil Sickness leading to low soil
   productivity and (iii). poor quality of life. These problems may be
   overcome with the adoption of Organic Agricultural practices. The
   definition of Organic Agriculture used in this paper is ``Organic
   Agriculture consists of those practices, which reduces the use of
   outside inputs viz., fertilizers and pesticides etc on the farm{''}.
   Therefore, various types of allelopathic strategies may be used for (a)
   maintenance of soil fertility (use of crop rotations, Biological
   Nitrogen Fixation, crop mixtures, crop residues and leaf litter etc.),
   (b) weed management (cover crops, crop residues as mulches,
   intercropping, crop rotations, phytotoxic or, allelopathic varieties and
   natural herbicides etc.), (c) insects pest management (cropping systems,
   resistant varieties, insecticidal allelochemicals etc.), (d) nematodes
   management (plant materials, oilseed cakes, nematicidal compounds etc.),
   (e) diseases management (cropping systems, crop residues, organic
   amendments etc.) and (f) use of allelochemicals as growth regulators.
   Therefore, research efforts are needed to utilise inhibitory
   allelopathic effects of plants for natural control of crop pests (weeds,
   insects, nematodes, pathogens), so that use of present pesticides could
   be minimized or eliminated for developing Sustainable Organic
   Agriculture, keeping the environment clean for our future generations
   and reducing the cost of Organic food.}},

   and soil moisture were measured as indicators of soil health. Fence line
   contrast sites were used to compare soil organism communities,
   infiltration rates and soil temperatures of natural vegetation remnants
   with adjacent transformed lands. Natural remnants retain soil moisture
   and contain more active soil fauna. Effects of land transformation are
   demonstrated by a 6.3 degrees C increased soil temperatures.
   Transformation favoured earthworms with 14 worms per 0.25m3 found in
   transformed areas compared with an average of four worms found in
   remnants. Infiltration rates were 4.8 times faster where earthworm
   casting was present.}},

Abstract = {{The living soil system is of primary importance in sustainable
   agricultural production. Soil quality is considered as an integrative
   indicator of environmental quality, food security and economic
   viability. Therefore, soil itself serves as a potential indicator for
   monitoring sustainable land management. As part of the soil quality
   concept, a healthy soil supports high levels of biological diversity,
   activity, internal nutrient cycling and resilience to disturbance. The
   use of microbial community structure and diversity as an indicator to
   monitor soil quality is challenging due to little understanding of the
   relationship between community structure and soil function. This review
   addresses two critical questions regarding soil quality: (1) which soil
   microbial properties, particularly diversity and community structure,
   most effectively characterize soil quality and can be used as
   indicators, and (2) how can soil quality assessed by such indicators be
   improved or maintained?
   We provide an overview of available techniques to characterize microbial
   community structure and diversity, and furnish information pertaining to
   strategies that can improve microbial diversity, including mycorrhizae,
   in relation to soil quality by adopting suitable agricultural practices
   to sustain soil and crop productivity. These techniques include those
   for structural profiling, i.e. fatty acid methyl ester analysis, genetic
   profiling, i.e. PCR-DGGE, SSCP, T-RFLP, functional profiling, i.e.
   catabolic profiling, diversity of enzyme activity, and to profile both
   structural and functional communities comprehensively, i.e. gene chip.
   We identify the importance of minimum data sets (MDS) of microbial
   indicators, such that they must be (i) compatible with basic ecosystem
   processes in soil as well as physical or chemical indicators of soil
   health, (ii) sensitive to management in acceptable time frames, (iii)
   easy to assess or measure, (iv) composed of robust methodology with
   standardized sampling techniques, (v) cost-effective, and (vi) relevant
   to human goals, food security, agricultural production, sustainability
   and economic efficiency. We focus on specific agricultural strategies
   such as tillage, crop rotations, organic amendments and microbial
   inoculation to improve soil quality by managing microbial communities
   and diversity. Overall, we provide techniques to assess microbial
   communities and diversity, and their management through agricultural
   practices to improve quality of soil.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-derived cellulosic materials play a critical role when organic
   wastes are composted to produce a beneficial amendment for topsoil. This
   review article considers publications dealing with the science of
   composting, emphasizing ways in which the cellulosic and lignin
   components of the composted material influence both the process and the
   product. Cellulose has been described as a main source of energy to
   drive the biological transformations and the consequent temperature rise
   and chemical changes that are associated with composting. Lignin can be
   viewed as a main starting material for the formation of humus, the
   recalcitrant organic matter that provides the water-holding, ion
   exchange, and bulking capabilities that can contribute greatly to soil
   health and productivity. Lignocellulosic materials also contribute to
   air permeability, bulking, and water retention during the composting
   process. Critical variables for successful composting include the ratio
   of carbon to nitrogen, the nature of the cellulosic component, particle
   size, bed size and format, moisture, pH, aeration, temperature, and
   time. Composting can help to address solid waste problems and provides a
   sustainable way to enhance soil fertility.}},

Abstract = {{Verticillium wilt is a major disease of potato caused by either
   Verticillium dahliae or Verticillium albo-atrum. Both species are
   soilborne fungi that invade xylem elements, disrupt water transport in
   plants and cause vascular wilt in a variety of hosts. Despite the broad
   host range of V. dahliae, a degree of host adaptation occurs with some
   isolates exhibiting different levels of aggressiveness depending on the
   host species and even cultivar within a species. In addition, isolates
   can be separated into vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) based on
   the ability to undergo hyphal anastamosis with other isolates. Distinct
   sub-specific groups have been recognized which contain host-adapted
   pathotypes that are aggressive and prevalent on particular hosts.
   Isolates of V. dahliae collected from potato stems, tubers and potato
   fields in the USA mostly belong to VCG 4A and VCG 4B, with the VCG 4A
   isolates being highly aggressive on potato compared with isolates of VCG
   4B and other VCGs. In contrast, isolates collected from potatoes grown
   in Israel were predominantly VCG 2A and VCG 4B. Initial inoculum of V.
   dahliae is primarily soilborne microsclerotia. Verticillium dahliae can
   be transmitted in certified seed tubers, but tuber-borne inoculum
   appears to have little effect on verticillium wilt symptoms and potato
   yields. Vascular infection by V. dahliae of seed tubers of the
   moderately susceptible potato cultivar `Russet Burbank' resulted in
   negligible effects on the development of verticillium wilt symptom, did
   not significantly contribute to aboveground stem infection or the
   formation of microsclerotia in debris, and did not significantly
   contribute to progeny tuber infection. An importance of tuber-borne
   inoculum is the potential to introduce inoculum to soils not previously
   used to grow potato or where a management practice such as fumigation
   has been applied to reduce soilborne inoculum. Management strategies
   should focus on reducing initial inoculum in soil and restricting
   vascular infection and pathogen development within the host. Tactics
   that may reduce initial inoculum include crop rotation, soil fumigation,
   green manures, soil solarization, and bio-fumigants. Cultivar resistance
   restricts pathogen infection and colonization of plants. Integration of
   several management tactics and a better understanding of soil health
   will be needed for lasting and economic management of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Perennial wheat could improve grain production systems in Australia by
   rectifying many environmental problems such as hydrological imbalance,
   nutrient losses, soil erosion, and declining soil carbon and soil
   health. There are also potential direct production benefits from reduced
   external inputs, providing extra grazing for livestock in mixed farming
   systems, as well as benefits for whole-farm management which may offset
   lower grain yields. In addition to universal issues of domestication and
   breeding of perennial wheat, specific challenges for perennial wheat in
   Australia's dryland systems will include tolerance of water deficit and
   poor soil environments, and the risks of hosting foliar pathogens over
   summer. Temperate perennial forage grasses could indicate the potential
   distribution and traits required in perennial wheat adapted to more arid
   environments (e.g. summer dormancy). Several Australian native and
   exotic perennial relatives of wheat could also provide sources of
   disease resistance, and tolerance of soil acidity, drought, salinity and
   waterlogging. Still, several farming systems could accommodate perennial
   wheat with inconsistent persistence in some environments. While
   developing perennial wheat will be challenging, there is significant
   opportunity in Australia for perennial wheat to diversify current
   cropping options. The risks may be minimised by staged investment and
   interim products with some immediate applications could be produced
   along the way.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-year field study was undertaken to investigate the effect of row
   spacing on vegetative growth, grain yield and water-use efficiency of
   wheat. All 3 years of the study experienced 21-51\% below-average
   rainfall for the growing season. Widening row spacing led to reduced
   biomass and tillers on per plant basis which could be related to the
   reduction in light interception by the wheat canopy in the wide rows
   which in turn could have reduced assimilate production. Reduction in
   vegetative growth in 54-cm rows translated into a significant reduction
   in grain yield which was strongly associated (r(2) = 0.71) with the loss
   of spike density. The pattern of crop water use (evapotranspiration, ET)
   during the growing season was very similar for the three row-spacing
   treatments. However, there was some evidence for slightly lower ET
   (similar to 5\%) in 54-cm rows in two growing seasons. More importantly,
   there was no evidence for increased ET during the post-anthesis phase in
   wide rows as has been speculated by some researchers. Over the 3 years
   of the study, grain yield declined by 5-8\% as row spacing increased
   from 18 to 36 cm and by a further 12-20\% as row spacing increased from
   36 to 54 cm. There was a consistent decline in water-use efficiency for
   grain (WUE(G)) with increasing row spacing over the 3 years. WUE(G)
   declined by 6-11\% as crop spacing increased from 18 to 36 cm and
   declined further by 12-15\% as row spacing increased to 54 cm. Lower
   light interception at wider row spacing could have reduced assimilate
   production by wheat as well as increased soil evaporation due to lower
   shading of the soil surface in more open canopies. Growers adopting
   wider row spacing on these relatively heavy textured soils are likely to
   experience some reduction in grain yield and WUE(G). However, some
   growers may be prepared to accept a small yield penalty from
   intermediate row spacing as a trade-off for increased stubble retention
   and soil health.}},

Abstract = {{Salinity has been an important historical factor which has influenced
   the life span of agricultural systems. Around 10\% of the total cropped
   land surface is covered with different types of salt-affected soils and
   the Asian continent accounts for the largest area affected by the
   salinity of various intensities. Cyanobacteria are capable of not only
   surviving, hut thriving in conditions which are considered to be
   inhabitable, tolerating desiccation, high temperature, extreme pH and
   high salinity, illustrating their capacity to acclimatise to extreme
   environments. Until recently, the responses of cyanobacteria to salinity
   stresses were poorly documented as compared to heterotrophic bacteria
   and phototrophic eukaryotic algae. Cyanobacteria can be used to reclaim
   alkaline soils and fertility can be improved for subsequent cultivation
   of cereal crops, sugarcane and horticultural crops. Therefore we present
   here a review on cyanobacterial reclamation of salt-affected soil.
   Substantial progress has been made towards better understanding of the
   physiological mechanisms responsible for salinity tolerance and osmotic
   adjustment in cyanobacteria. Many researchers throughout the world have
   worked on probable mechanisms of salt tolerance studies in
   cyanobacteria. These organisms evolved about 3,000 million years ago and
   are considered to be the primary colonisers of the inhospitable
   ecosystems. The physiological aspects for the adaptation of
   cyanobacteria to high salinities include (a) synthesis and accumulation
   of osmoprotective compounds, (b) maintenance of low internal
   concentrations of inorganic ions and (c) expression of a set of
   salt-stress proteins. Exposure of cyanobacterial cells to different
   abiotic stresses resulted in rapid expression of several
   stress-regulated proteins and modifications in protein synthesis
   programme. The synthesis of organic solutes like disaccharides (sucrose,
   trehalose and glucosyl glycerol), quaternary amines (glycine betaine)
   and free amino acids (glutamine) are well-documented. The protection
   against alkaline environment is provided by the synthesis of specific
   fatty acids, sucrose- and osmotic-stress-induced proteins. In
   cyanobacteria, accumulation of internal osmoticum in the form of
   inorganic ions and prevention of intracellular Na+ accumulation by the
   curtailment of Na influx and by efficient active efflux mechanisms or
   metabolic adjustments have been investigated in depth. The Na+ extrusion
   in cyanobacteria is driven by a Na+/H+ antiporter, which is energised by
   enhanced activity of cytochrome oxidase. The inhibition of sodium ion
   influx appears to be a major mechanism for the survival of cyanobacteria
   against salt stress and synthesis of salt-stress proteins have been
   found in cyanobacteria. These organisms have been recognised as an
   important agent in the stabilisation of soil surfaces primarily through
   the production of extracellular polysaccharides which are prominent
   agents in the process of aggregate formation and increase in soil
   fertility. Cyanobacterial application results in the enrichment of soil
   with fixed nitrogen, soil structure improvement and declining trend of
   pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and Na+. The extracellular
   polysaccharides excreted by cyanobacteria have been reported to be
   responsible for binding of soil particles, thus, leading to the
   formation of a tough and entangled superficial structure that improves
   the stability of soil surface and protects it from erosion. The
   potential impact of these organisms on agriculture through their use as
   soil conditioners, plant growth regulators and soil health ameliorators
   has been well-recognised. Besides bringing about an improvement in the
   yield of rice, cyanobacteria produce direct and indirect beneficial
   changes in the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil and
   soil water interface in the rice fields, which are of agronomic
   importance. Certain cyanobacteria have been found not only to grow in
   saline ecosystems but also improve the physico-chemical properties of
   the soil by enriching them with carbon, nitrogen and available
   phosphorus. Flushing of field may not be effective for the reclamation
   of saline soils and the addition of cyanobacterium inoculum along with
   the addition of gypsum is required before irrigation to ameliorate
   saline soils.
   Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria can be used as biological input to improve
   soil texture, conserve moisture, scavenge the toxic sodium cation from
   the soil complex and improve the properties of sols. Virtually
   negligible information exists on the genetics of cyanobacterial
   halotolerance. The presence of combined nitrogen which effectively
   curtails sodium accumulation and supports extra nitrogen demand for
   osmoregulation during slat stress confers considerable salt tolerance on
   cyanobacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition of the importance of soil microbial communities in various
   ecosystems is burgeoning. Additionally, the effects of microbial
   biodiversity on rangeland plant communities, rangeland soil health and
   quality are becoming increasingly recognized. Concepts such as plant
   soil feedback on invasive species including in combination with insect
   herbivory are also receiving greater recognition. There are some
   overlooked themes in this area of study. The role of plant pathogens in
   restoration of rangeland plant communities and on rangeland productivity
   and community structure should receive more emphasis. Out of the
   spotlight of the prevailing focus on effects and impact of mycorrhizae
   in prairie systems, the study of basidiomycetes is overlooked. The
   extension of the concept of functional diversity generally applied to
   plant communities in their resistance to invasion can also be extended
   to soil microflora and microfauna. The implication of this is that
   rangelands will be a highly relevant setting to explore relationship
   between microbial diversity and plant diversity. A more complete and
   holistic approach to managing rangelands for the sustainable provision
   of ecosystem services must properly include the role of soil microbial
   community diversity and further the role of key (or keystone) species in
   these communities.}},

Abstract = {{In the recent years, papaya cultivation in India has become more popular
   because of its high yield and nutritive qualities. There also have
   emerged niche markets for organically produced fruits especially in the
   urban areas. Keeping in view the emerging trend, a study was conducted
   at Central Horticultural Experiment Station (IIHR) during 2004-07 in
   order to organize modules for sustainable production of organic papaya
   var. `Coorg Honey Dew' under Coorg region of Karnataka, India. In this
   study, the effects of seven different treatments viz., recommended dose
   of NPK fertilizers (250: 250: 500 g NPK plant(-1) year(-1) as check
   (T-1); FYM 20 kg/plant (T-2), urban compost 13.5 kg/plant (T-3), sun
   hemp 25 kg/plant (T-4), sun hemp 40 kg/plant + rock phosphate 300
   g/plant (T-5), neem cake 4 kg + wood ash 2.5 kg/plant (T-6) and rural
   compost 35 kg/plant (T-7) applied to `Coorg Honey Dew' papaya crop were
   studied on nutrient availability, microbial population and enzyme
   activities in sandy loam soil in a field experiment laid out in
   randomized block design with three replications. Soil analysis after
   three years of study indicated no significant effect of treatments on
   the status of available P and K and the pH of the soil. Organic matter
   content in soil was significantly influenced by different treatments
   with the highest values recorded under T-2 and T-3 treatments. Soils
   under different organic modules had significantly higher microbial
   population (bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes) and activities of urease,
   phosphatase, dehydrogenase and cellulases as compared to that under
   recommended dose of fertilizers (T-1). Significant positive association
   between organic matter status, microbial populations and enzyme
   activities in soil was recorded. Application of FYM 20 kg/plant (T-2)
   was the best organic module with regard to higher microbial populations
   and enzyme activities in soil.}},

Abstract = {{Khandeshi farmers, cultivating bananas in the Tapi river basin, have no
   alternative than adopting sustainable production practices, including
   management of natural resources, due to ongoing deterioration of soils,
   high annual nutrient turnover in banana (Musa spp.) eco-systems,
   overexploited water reservoirs and stagnation of banana production.
   Possible ways to meet the growing demand of qualitative and quantitative
   increase in banana production include: (a) fostering the farmers'
   co-operative movement in the region; (b) utilizing tissue culture
   derived and/or naturally selected high yielding cultivars; (c)
   adequately applying soil conditioners (organic manure and fly ash); (d)
   appropriately managing irrigation; (e) increasing the vitality through
   application of amino-acid based plant growth regulators; and (f)
   preserving soil health through implementation of eco-friendly
   technologies. The latter may include the individual or combined
   application of (a) soil conditioner after its production from banana
   orchard waste; (b) efficient bio-fertilizers specially developed for the
   banana mycorrhizal sphere; (c) coal-combustion ash as a source of
   micro-nutrients; and (d) judiciously applied doses and frequencies of
   chemical fertilizers and irrigation water. Adoption of these sustainable
   production practices would help Khandeshi farmers to conserve and
   recycle the available natural resources, protect their environment,
   develop profitable farming systems and enhance the quality of their
   livelihood. Overall possibilities for improving sustainability in banana
   production in the region are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnostic surveys conducted in the mountain district of Lushoto,
   Northeastern Tanzania revealed a decline in banana (Musa spp.)
   production largely attributed to deteriorating soil health, soil
   erosion, low adoption of proven banana technologies, and at least
   partially, due to a lack of innovative scaling out approaches. Further,
   most farmers were not practicing soil and water conservation (SWC)
   because it is labor intensive. Focus group discussions and key informant
   interviews established that improved tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum),
   cabbage (Brassica spp.) and banana germplasm were the three most
   preferred technologies, and hence were considered important entry
   points. The uptake of these technologies was however different. Banana
   uptake was slowest because of the high cost of planting material.
   Limited planting materials were supplied by the African Highland
   Initiative (AHI) for multiplication using primary schools and farmer
   research groups. Improved banana technology was linked to SWC
   technologies that included stabilizing the soil by fodder species and
   increased manure from well-fed livestock to address the multiple
   constraints of erosion and declining soil fertility. In this paper,
   entry points refer to interventions addressing priority needs as
   identified by farmers, while linked technologies refer to integrated,
   complementary technologies that holistically address multiple
   constraints, leading to multiple benefits. Results show that in Lushoto,
   for example, the increase in farmers adopting improved banana germplasm
   from the original adopters, who were in direct contact with researchers,
   was about 1,125\% within two years. The study shows that the use of
   innovative scaling out approaches increases the adoption of technologies
   that appear expensive and less attractive to farmers.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural industries located in coastal catchments adjacent to the
   Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Queensland, Australia, are facing
   increasing pressure to demonstrate that their production systems are
   environmentally sustainable. Our experiences show that research and
   technology to improve productivity and profitability can also address
   environmental issues associated with off-site movement of nutrients. Due
   to limited water availability, vegetable farmers in the region utilise
   trickle irrigation and fertigation, often combined with polyethylene
   mulch film and seedling transplant technology. This system conserves
   water and allows for accurate and timely placement of fertiliser. The
   challenges for vegetable production systems in a dry tropical
   environment are: periods of high summer rainfall on fallow land;
   inherently low soil carbon with associated impacts on soil health
   properties (nutrient cycling, resistance to soil erosion); potential for
   denitrification under mulches; and salinisation of the soil profile.
   Fertiliser recommendations are based on empirical data rather than
   calibrated soil and plant tissue diagnostic indices. There is a need to
   develop science-based tools for objectively assessing and facilitating
   improved best practice nutrient management on a soil-, site- and crop-
   specific basis. In collaboration with local vegetable growers, we are
   modifying a decision support tool from the sugarcane industry for
   assessing the risk of off-site movement of nitrogen and phosphorus for
   the horticulture industry. This process is identifying large gaps in
   available input data (critical soil P test levels, crop growth cycles,
   nutrient uptake and removal data) for a number of vegetable crops but
   confirming the potential of the package to deal with the complexity and
   variability needed to support best management practices for nutrients in
   vegetable cropping systems.}},

Abstract = {{Low concentrations of native nutrients in soil, especially nitrogen and
   phosphorus, are a major constraint limiting crop productivity in highly
   leached acid soils of the subtropical Indian Himalayas. This is coupled
   with the negligible use of fertilizers and pesticides, which restricts
   the productivity of field crops. Further, this area has acute shortage
   of farmyard manure (FYM) and other organic manures. In a 2-year field
   study (2004-06) the performance of eight different types of composts
   prepared from rice straw (Oryza sativa), Eupatorium adhenophorum,
   Lantana camara, and grass/weed mixtures was evaluated and compared with
   the recommended combinations of NPK (80:60:40 kg/ha) and FYM on
   productivity of lowland rice (Oryza sativa L) under organic production.
   Two composting procedures were evaluated. One was the Microbial Enriched
   Compost (MEC), procedure consisting of mixing plant biomass and cow dung
   in equal proportion (weight basis) followed by addition of microbial
   inoculants in a slurry of fresh cow dung, virgin soil and well rotten
   compost mixed in a ratio of 1:1: 0.5 along with appropriate amount of
   water. The second was Microbial and Nutrient Fortified Compost (MNFC)
   consisting of MEC, 2.5\% rock phosphate (w/w) and 1\% neem cake.
   Bioinoculums such as cellulose decomposers (Aspergillus terrus,
   Trichoderma harzianum, T. viride, T. virens), P-solubilizing microbes
   (Bacillus polymyxa and Pseudomonas striata) and free-living N-fixers
   (Azotobacter spp) were used as microbial inoculants to hasten the
   composting and improve the nutritional quality of the composts. The
   matured composts had higher NPK contents and lower C/N ratio compared to
   the fresh dry biomass of the substrates (plant materials used for
   composting) and FYM. The bacterial population in matured rice straw MNFC
   compost was about five times higher and fungal and actininomycetes
   population was about 3 times higher than that recorded with decomposed
   FYM. The study indicated that the significantly (p = 0.05) higher grain
   yield was recorded with rice straw MNFC compost in both years (4.50 t/ha
   in 2005 and 4.68 t/ha in 2006) followed by the Eupatorium MNFC compost
   (4.33 t/ha and 4.56 t/ha). In general MNFC composts recorded
   significantly higher grain yields compared to MEC composts indicating
   superiority of nutritional quality of MNFC composts. The nutrient uptake
   and post harvest soil fertility status were found to be significantly
   improved due to application of various composts. Composting with locally
   available biomass results in higher rice crop productivity and in
   maintenance of soil health of acid soils of Northeastern region of
   India.}},

Abstract = {{The demand to improve soil health, arrest land degradation, in
   particular desertification in agro-ecosystems and protect land and water
   resources for food production and sustainable agricultural and
   socio-economic development is expected to increase in the next 50 years
   as a result of the continuing worldwide population growth and the
   increased reliance on limited natural resource-based economy. Moreover,
   the intensive competition for land and water resources from industrial,
   urban and other sectors and the impacts of widespread soil degradation
   and global climate change will place increasing pressure on the need to
   improve sustainable land and water use and management. The objective of
   the Soil and Water Management \& Crop Nutrition (SWMCN) Subprogramme of
   the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and
   Agriculture is to assist Member States to use isotopic and nuclear-based
   techniques to diagnose constraints and pilot-test interventions to
   intensify crop production in a sustainable manner through the integrated
   management of soil, water and nutrient resources without land
   degradation. This objective is pursued through a range of activities
   including (a) co-ordinated research projects (CRP) which involve
   international networks of national agricultural research organizations
   from developing countries, advanced research institutes and CGIAR
   institutions, and (b) technical co-operation projects (TCP) that promote
   technology transfer through technical support and institutional capacity
   building in FAO and IAEA Member States. This chapter will report on the
   application of isotopic and nuclear techniques to unravel processes and
   factors that affect land degradation and major findings obtained from
   both CRPs and TCPs that were aimed to avoid and mitigate land
   degradation. Since land degradation includes not only soil erosion but
   also the decline in soil quality and their constituents (such as water
   and nutrients) with its subsequent reduction in crop production,
   projects that are associated with improving soil health, minimizing
   nutrient mining, combating soil salinity, soil acidity and
   desertification and enhancing water use efficiency will also be briefly
   presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Soil health can be boosted by improving soil texture, aeration,
   drainage, and nutritional content by application of manure/amendments
   besides promoting the growth of the beneficial biota and suppressing the
   pathogens. Manures can vary in their nutrient contents and forms,
   depending on their processing and storage procedures, feeds and feed
   supplements used, etc. Of the total N, 30\% to 90\% is comprised of
   ammonium while the rest is contained in organic forms that must be
   decomposed (mineralized) to inorganic forms to be available to plants.
   Likewise, the phosphorus in manure tends to be fixed in soils by
   sorption and precipitation reactions and its mineralization takes place
   to make it available to plants. Manures are also effective sources of
   potassium (K) and sulphur (S). The manure-enriched soils enhance the
   populations of mites and collembolans besides increasing the number of
   fungi that directly affect the population of soil nematodes. Some of the
   fungi use adhesive conidia, branches, knobs and mycelia to parasitize
   nematodes. However, compared to plant parasitic nematodes, the density
   of opportunistic bacterial-feeding and fungal-feeding nematodes
   increases significantly in the soils treated with manure. Among the
   manures of animal origin poultry and farmyard manures give significantly
   higher yields than those of other organic manures. The impacts of
   manures also vary considerably in the soil systems. Poultry manure
   causes short term (within a growing season) increases in microbiological
   activity and nutrient cycling, whereas farm yard manure seems to bring
   long-term changes. Green manure application too has gained wide
   acceptance due to the improvement in soil characteristics, including
   drainage and water retention, nutrient content and storage, and level of
   microbiological activity in the soil.}},

Booktitle = {{MICROBES FOR LEGUME IMPROVEMENT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Pages = {{389-408}},
Abstract = {{A rapid and sustained increase in crop production is one of the
   essential steps to meet the food demands of the growing human population
   all over the world. Constant and unbalanced use of chemical fertilizers
   used to boost the crop productivity on the other hand is causing
   decrease in nutrient uptake leading to decreased crop yields. Moreover,
   the use of chemical fertilizers has several other drawbacks, like they
   are expensive and cause ground water, soil, and atmospheric pollution.
   Long-term sustainability in agriculture is possible only through the use
   of low cost farm grown inputs, which work in harmony with the nature.
   Biofertilizers in this regard act as perpetually responsible input
   helping in better maintenance of crop nutrient as well as soil health.
   Azospirillum, an associative symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium, has a
   higher nitrogen-fixing potential. Though, a number of papers have
   highlighted the potential application of this microbe, further more
   research is still needed on Azospirillum to understand the mechanism by
   which the introduced microorganism benefit the crop. The present review
   addresses the central issues of Azosprillum application either alone or
   in combination with other plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria for the
   benefit of the crops.}},

Abstract = {{The study was conducted to evaluate the quality of effluents/ waste
   water samples from Rawalpindi region for irrigation purpose and to
   elucidate effects of their application on heavy metal contents in soils
   of area. Results indicated that the EC, SAR, RSC and TDS of most
   effluent/ waste water samples were above the critical limits. Cadmium
   and Cr were above the critical limits in almost all the effluent
   samples, whereas Ni was high in 14, Pb was high in 10, Cu was high in 5
   and the Fe was high in 3 effluent samples as compared to critical
   limits. Regarding heavy metals contents of soils irrigated by these
   effluents/ waste water, total Fe, total Cd and total Ni were higher in
   almost all the sampled sites, whereas total Cr was high at 7 sampled
   sites. AB-DTPA extractable Fe and Zn were higher at all the sampled
   sites, while the extractable Cd was higher at 2 sampled sites. Overall,
   the effluent samples collected from Adiala showed high concentrations of
   heavy metals, whereas soils of Wah factory and Islamabad area had higher
   heavy metal contents (total \& AB-DTPA extractable). On the basis of
   results it is concluded that quality of effluents/ waste water samples
   collected from different locations of Rawalpindi is not good for
   irrigation and the long term use of these effluents for crop production
   caused accumulation of some toxic metals in soils above critical limits
   which is harmful for soil health and may lead to elevated levels of
   heavy metals in crop plants.}},

Abstract = {{The intensification of agricultural production on a global scale has
   become the need of hour to fulfill the food supply of increasing world
   population. As a result, more and more organic carbon is being removed
   from the soil leading to dramatic soil degradation. Over-exploitation of
   soils has depleted an enormous amount of soil organic carbon.
   One method of increasing the soil health is through the application of
   biochar (carbonized material) that have long term stability. The term
   biochar refers to black carbon formed by the pyrolysis of biomass i.e.
   by heating the biomass in an oxygen-free or low oxygen environment such
   that it does not combust. The definition adopted by International
   Biochar Initiative (IBI) further emphasizes on its application on
   agricultural lands. The charred material has highly porous structure,
   potentially responsible for improved water retention and increased soil
   surface area.
   The study of physical and chemical properties of biochar has led to the
   conclusion that it may serve as a long term source of organic carbon,
   reduce leaching of organic and inorganic fertilizers and has potential
   to increase the soil productivity. It also increases the water holding
   capacity of soil and its nutrient use efficiency. Although some
   evidences exist that it can reduce the soil emissions of N2O and CH4.
   Therefore, it may help in climate change mitigation. Further studies in
   this field may help in better understanding of its interaction with
   soil.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) provides a direct means for
   measuring lead chemical forms in complex samples. In this study, XAS was
   used to identify the presence of plumbojarosite (PbFe6(SO4)(4)(OH)(12))
   by lead L-3-edge XANES spectra in mine waste from a small gold mining
   operation in Fiji. The presence of plumbojarosite in tailings was
   confirmed by XRD but XANES gave better resolution. The potential for
   human uptake of Pb from tailings was measured using a physiologically
   based extract test (PBET), an in-vitro bioaccessibility (BAc) method.
   The BAc of Pb was 55\%. Particle size distribution of tailings indicated
   that 40\% of PM10 particulates exist which could be a potential risk for
   respiratory effects via the inhalation route. Food items collected in
   the proximity of the mine site had lead concentrations which exceed food
   standard guidelines(1). Lead within the mining lease exceeded sediment
   guidelines(2). The results from this study are used to investigate
   exposure pathways via ingestion and inhalation for potential risk
   exposure pathways of Pb in that locality. The highest Pb concentration
   in soil and tailings was 25,839 mg/kg, exceeding the Australian National
   Environment Protection Measure (NEPM) soil health investigation levels.}},

Abstract = {{Climatic endowments, soil and water resources are the key factors for
   high productivity. Intensified agriculture coupled with indiscriminate
   use of irrigation water and heavy application of fertilizers and/or
   plant protection chemicals to achieve maximum production in irrigated
   areas have, however, led to various kinds of physical and chemical
   degradation of the soil. Besides, emergence of multi-nutrient
   deficiencies, the problems of soil salinity, alkalinity and waterlogging
   also got accentuated. This calls for an integration of technologies for
   conservation and management of resources vis-a-vis input use
   efficiencies while safeguarding the soil health and sustaining the crop
   productivity. The use of organics in association with chemical
   fertilizers has proved superior over its individual components.
   Moreover, organics increase the nutrient use efficiency and bring an
   economy in fertilizer use. The fertilizer and manurial schedules in the
   system help in correcting the emerging deficiencies of nutrients other
   than, N, P and K particularly the micronutrients. Bio-manurial nutrient
   management strategies include:
   (i) Integration of organics with fertilizers
   (ii) Nutrient management through legumes including green manuring
   (iii) Crop residues recycling with an accent on input economy
   (iv) Bio-manuring integrating biofertilizers with organics
   (v) Utilizing sugar factory by-products/wastes to supply plant nutrients
   Sugarcane being a long duration and huge biomass accumulating crop,
   removes substantial quantities of plant nutrients from soil. Thus, the
   management of plant nutrients for high sugarcane production with
   improved quality traits demands integration of chemical fertilizers with
   organics, green manures/legumes-N, crop residues, bio-manures and sugar
   factory by-products/ wastes to enhance over all nutrient use efficiency
   and reduce production cost. The plant nutrient management strategies
   should, however, be in tune with large nutritional requirements ensuring
   full replenishment of the nutrients depleted through intensive sugarcane
   based production systems.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of plant health is far more than the opposite of plant
   disease, although relative freedom from disease is necessary. A healthy
   plant has to grow in a healthy soil, in which the absence of major
   (clinical) and minor (subclinical) pathogens and a balanced biotic and
   abiotic environment for plant growth are prerequisites for achieving a
   balanced system. In addition, soil health has to be sustainable, thus
   the soil has to maintain a certain level of suppressiveness to protect
   it from pathogen invasion. Soil health should be achieved with minimal
   disturbance of the environment and depletion of natural resources. A
   variety of tests can be used to assess soil health: assessment of
   pathogen populations, tests for microbial activity and diversity,
   chemical and physical analyses, biotests and remote sensing techniques.
   Decision-making tools can be most helpful. Soil disinfestation (alone or
   combined with other methods) is a very effective tool for improving soil
   health in pathogen-infested soils or in soil with sickness (fatigue) or
   replant problems. Beyond pathogen control, soil disinfestation may also
   improve plant health in noninfested soils. Soil disinfestation should be
   part of a holistic approach that includes additional means of improving
   crop and soil health so as not to depend on a single method of
   management.}},

Abstract = {{The Montreal Protocol which regulates ozone depleting gases is the most
   effective environmental protocol and now has a commitment from all
   Parties in the world. It has dramatically reduced consumption of the
   major ozone depleting chemical, methyl bromide (MB), and represents an
   excellent model for future phaseout of other environmentally damaging
   products, such as those involved with climate change. Over a fifteen
   year period, 85\% of MB (c. 45,000 t) used for preplant soil fumigation
   has been phased out and a wide range of chemical and non chemical
   technologies adopted for disease and weed control in agriculture. In
   addition to use of alternative fumigants there has been an increased use
   of substrate systems, grafting and plant resistance for disease control
   which, in most cases, avoid the need for soil disinfestation. An
   international metaanalysis has shown that other fumigants, such as
   1,3-dichloropropene (1,3 D)/chloropicrin (Pic), metham sodium,
   iodomethane (MI)/Pic, with or without barrier films are effective and
   these also have been adopted by growers as alternatives strategies for
   soil disinfestation with generally equivalent yields to MB. The
   implementation of these alternatives has led to a 45\% fall in bromine
   in the atmosphere and this is very important to ozone layer recovery.
   Internationally, pressure is mounting to restrict use of all fumigants
   worldwide (EC Reg 2037/US Cluster Analysis) and this will further
   stimulate new technologies for plant disease control. There are also
   moves to restrict MB, approx. 10,300 tonnes a year, used for quarantine
   and pre-shipment (QPS). The pressure on fumigant use globally will
   continue to stimulate development of more sustainable integrated pest
   management (IPM) strategies that are beneficial to soil health and crop
   yields.}},

Abstract = {{Soil contamination with heavy metals occurs as a result of both
   anthropogenic and natural activities. Heavy metals could have long-term
   hazardous impacts on the health of soil ecosystems and adverse
   influences on soil biological processes. Soil enzymatic activities are
   recognized as sensors towards any natural and anthropogenic disturbance
   occurring in the soil ecosystem. Similarly, microbial biomass carbon
   (MBC) is also considered as one of the important soil biological
   activities frequently influenced by heavy metal contamination. The
   polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
   has recently been used to investigate changes in soil microbial
   community composition in response to environmental stresses. Soil
   microbial community structure and activities are difficult to elucidate
   using single monitoring approach; therefore, for a better insight and
   complete depiction of the soil microbial situation, different approaches
   need to be used. This study was conducted in a greenhouse for a period
   of 12 weeks to evaluate the changes in indigenous microbial community
   structure and activities in the soil amended with different application
   rates of Cd, Pb, and Cd/Pb mix. In a field environment, soil is
   contaminated with single or mixed heavy metals; so that, in this
   research, we used the selected metals in both single and mixed forms at
   different application rates and investigated their toxic effects on
   microbial community structure and activities, using soil enzyme assays,
   plate counting, and advanced molecular DGGE technique. Soil microbial
   activities, including acid phosphatase (ACP), urease (URE), and MBC, and
   microbial community structure were studied.
   A soil sample (0-20 cm) with an unknown history of heavy metal
   contamination was collected and amended with Cd, Pb, and Cd/Pb mix using
   the CdSO(4) and Pb(NO(3))(2) solutions at different application rates.
   The amended soils were incubated in the greenhouse at 25 +/- 4A degrees
   C and 60\% water-holding capacity for 12 weeks. During the incubation
   period, samples were collected from each pot at 0, 2, 9, and 12 weeks
   for enzyme assays, MBC, numeration of microbes, and DNA extraction.
   Fumigation-extraction method was used to measure the MBC, while plate
   counting techniques were used to numerate viable heterotrophic bacteria,
   fungi, and actinomycetes. Soil DNAs were extracted from the samples and
   used for DGGE analysis.
   ACP, URE, and MBC activities of microbial community were significantly
   lower (p < 0.05) in the metal-amended samples than those in the control.
   The enzyme inhibition extent was obvious between different incubation
   periods and varied as the incubation proceeded, and the highest rate was
   detected in the samples after 2 weeks. However, the lowest values of ACP
   and URE activities (35.6\% and 36.6\% of the control, respectively) were
   found in the Cd(3)/Pb(3)-treated sample after 2 weeks. Similarly, MBC
   was strongly decreased in both Cd/Pb-amended samples and highest
   reduction (52.4\%) was detected for Cd(3)/Pb(3) treatment. The number of
   bacteria and actinomycetes were significantly decreased in the heavy
   metal-amended samples compared to the control, while fungal cells were
   not significantly different (from 2.3\% to 23.87\%). In this study, the
   DGGE profile indicated that the high dose of metal amendment caused a
   greater change in the number of bands. DGGE banding patterns confirmed
   that the addition of metals had a significant impact on microbial
   community structure.
   In soil ecosystem, heavy metals exhibit toxicological effects on soil
   microbes which may lead to the decrease of their numbers and activities.
   This study demonstrated that toxicological effects of heavy metals on
   soil microbial community structure and activities depend largely on the
   type and concentration of metal and incubation time. The inhibition
   extent varied widely among different incubation periods for these
   enzymes. Furthermore, the rapid inhibition in microbial activities such
   as ACP, URE, and MBC were observed in the 2 weeks, which should be
   related to the fact that the microbes were suddenly exposed to heavy
   metals. The increased inhibition of soil microbial activities is likely
   to be related to tolerance and adaptation of the microbial community,
   concentration of pollutants, and mechanisms of heavy metals. The DGGE
   profile has shown that the structure of the bacterial community changed
   in amended heavy metal samples. In this research, the microbial
   community structure was highly affected, consistent with the lower
   microbial activities in different levels of heavy metals. Furthermore, a
   great community change in this study, particularly at a high level of
   contamination, was probably a result of metal toxicity and also
   unavailability of nutrients because no nutrients were supplied during
   the whole incubation period.
   The added concentrations of heavy metals have changed the soil microbial
   community structure and activities. The highest inhibitory effects on
   soil microbial activities were observed at 2 weeks of incubation. The
   bacteria were more sensitive than actinomycetes and fungi. The DGGE
   profile indicated that bacterial community structure was changed in the
   Cd/Pb-amended samples, particularly at high concentrations.
   The investigation of soil microbial community structure and activities
   together could give more reliable and accurate information about the
   toxic effects of heavy metals on soil health.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging plates sensitive to beta rays were used to obtain the images of
   Sr-90 in tooth samples taken from mammals collected in contaminated
   areas of the former Soviet Union. The average concentrations of Sr-90 in
   the samples were determined by comparing the intensities of the
   luminescence using a single crystal of KCl. The results showed that the
   determined Sr-90 concentration has a positive correlation with the soil
   contamination levels in the South Ural region. Tooth samples from both
   inside of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site and the villages nearby
   have detectable amounts of Sr-90, indicating the possible presence of
   residual soil contamination. The present study demonstrates that using
   imaging plates is a very sensitive method to detect Sr-90 in teeth as

Abstract = {{The amendment of two agricultural soils with two biochars derived from
   the slow pyrolysis of papermill waste was assessed in a glasshouse
   study. Characterisation of both biochars revealed high surface area (115
   m(2) g(-1)) and zones of calcium mineral agglomeration. The biochars
   differed slightly in their liming values (33\% and 29\%), and carbon
   content (50\% and 52\%). Molar H/C ratios of 0.3 in the biochars
   suggested aromatic stability. At application rates of 10 t ha(-1) in a
   ferrosol both biochars significantly increased pH, CEC, exchangeable Ca
   and total C, while in a calcarosol both biochars increased C while
   biochar 2 also increased exchangeable K. Biochars reduced Al
   availability (ca. 2 cmol (+) kg(-1) to < 0.1 cmol (+) kg(-1)) in the
   ferrosol. The analysis of biomass production revealed a range of
   responses, due to both biochar characteristics and soil type. Both
   biochars significantly increased N uptake in wheat grown in fertiliser
   amended ferrosol. Concomitant increase in biomass production (250\%
   times that of control) therefore suggested improved fertiliser use
   efficiency. Likewise, biochar amendment significantly increased biomass
   in soybean and radish in the ferrosol with fertiliser. The calcarosol
   amended with fertiliser and biochar however gave varied crop responses:
   Increased soybean biomass, but reduced wheat and radish biomass. No
   significant effects of biochar were shown in the absence of fertiliser
   for wheat and soybean, while radish biomass increased significantly.
   Earthworms showed preference for biochar-amended ferrosol over control
   soils with no significant difference recorded for the calcarosol. The
   results from this work demonstrate that the agronomic benefits of
   papermill biochars have to be verified for different soil types and
   crops.}},

Abstract = {{The role of geomorphology in relation to the spatial and temporal
   distribution of soil carbon is of considerable interest in terms of
   landscape management and carbon sequestration. Soil carbon plays an
   important role in soil water holding capacity, soil structure and
   overall soil health. Soil is also a significant store of terrestrial
   carbon. This study examines total soil carbon (SC) concentration at the
   hillslope and catchment scale in the Tin Camp Creek catchment, Arnhem
   Land, Northern Territory, Australia. The catchment is largely
   undisturbed by European agriculture or management practices and is
   located in the monsoonal tropics. Results show that SC concentration
   along hillslope transects has remained consistent over a number of years
   and it is strongly related to hillslope position and topographic factors
   derived from precision surveying and provides a baseline assessment.
   Poor relationships were found when using a good quality medium
   resolution digital elevation model to derive topographic factors. This
   finding demonstrates the need for high resolution survey data for the
   prediction of total C at the hillslope and catchment scale. There was
   little difference in SC concentration between years and overall, SC down
   the hillslope profile varies little temporally suggesting that
   concentrations are relatively stable in this environment. An assessment
   of the relationship between SC and soil erosion using (137)Cs and
   erosion pins demonstrates that sediment transport and deposition play
   little role in the distribution of SC in this environment. Vegetative
   biomass appears to be the major contributor to SC concentration with
   vegetative biomass being strongly controlled by topographic factors.
   While the SC concentration is constant over the study period further
   sampling is required to assess decadal trends. Crown Copyright (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Preventive and/or manipulative practices will be needed to maintain
   soil's biological, physiochemical, nutritional, and structural health in
   natural, managed, and disturbed ecosystems as a foundation for rood
   security and global ecosystem sustainability. While there is a
   substantial body of interdisciplinary science on understanding function
   and structure of soil ecosystems, key gaps must be bridged in assessing
   integrated agro-biological, ecological, economical, and environmental
   efficiency of soil manipulation practices in time and space across
   ecosystems. This presentation discusses the application of a fertilizer
   use efficiency (FUE) model for assessing agronomic, economic,
   ecological, environmental, and nematode (pest) management efficiency of
   soil amendments. FUE is defined as increase in host productivity and/or
   decrease in plant-parasitic nematode population density in response to a
   given fertilizer treatment. Using the effects of nutrient amendment on
   Heterodera glycines population density and normalized difference
   vegetative index (indicator of physiological activities) of a soybean
   cultivar `CX 252', how the FUE model recognizes variable responses and
   separates nutrient deficiency and toxicity From nematode parasitism :is
   troll as suitability of treatments designed to achieve desired
   biological and physiochemical soil health conditions is demonstrated. As
   part of bridging gaps between agricultural and ecological approaches to
   integrated understanding and management cif soil health, modifications
   of the FUE model for analyzing the relationships amongst nematode
   community structure, soil parameters (eg. pH, nutrients, \%OM), and
   plant response to soil amendment is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial biogeography is the study of the distribution of microbial
   diversity on large scales of space and time. This science aims at
   understanding biodiversity regulation and its link with ecosystem
   biological functioning, goods and services such as maintenance of
   productivity, of soil and atmospheric quality, and of soil health.
   Although the initial concept dates from the early 20th century
   (Beijerinck (1913) De infusies en de ontdekking der backterien, in:
   Jaarboek van de Knoniklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen, Muller,
   Amsterdam), only recently have an increasing number of studies have
   investigated the biogeographical patterns of soil microbial diversity. A
   such delay is due to the constraints of the microbial models, the need
   to develop relevant molecular and bioinformatic tools to assess
   microbial diversity, and the non-availability of an adequate sampling
   strategy. Consequently, the conclusions from microbial ecology studies
   have rarely been generally applicable and even the fundamental
   power-laws differ because the taxa-area relationship and the influence
   of global and distal parameters on the spatial distribution of microbial
   communities have not been examined. In this article we define and
   discuss the scientific, technical and operational limits and outcomes
   resulting from soil microbial biogeography together with the technical
   and logistical feasibility. The main results are that microbial
   communities are not stochastically distributed on a wide scale and that
   biogeographical patterns are more influenced by local parameters such as
   soil type and land use than by distal ones, e. g. climate and
   geomorphology, contrary to plants and animals. We then present the
   European soil biological survey network, focusing on the French national
   initiative and the ``ECOMIC-RMQS{''} project. The objective of the
   ECOMIC-RMQS project is to characterise the density and diversity of
   bacterial communities in all soils in the RMQS library in order to
   assess, for the first time, not only microbial biogeography across the
   whole of France but also the impact of land use on soil biodiversity
   (Reseau de Mesures de la Qualite des Sols = French Soil Quality
   Monitoring Network, 2200 soils covering all the French territory with a
   systematic grid of sampling). The scientific, technical and logistical
   outputs are examined with a view to the future prospects needed to
   develop this scientific domain and its applications in sustainable land
   use.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) leaching from agricultural soils is a major concern in the
   southeastern USA. A winter cover crop following the summer crop rotation
   is essential for controlling N leaching and soil run-off, thereby
   improving sustainable development. Rotation of peanut (Arachis hypogea
   L.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) with bahiagrass (Paspalum
   notatum) (i.e. sod-based rotation) can greatly improve soil health and
   increase crop yields and profitability. In the sod-based rotation, the
   winter cover crop is an important component. The objective of this study
   was to determine effects of summer crops, cotton and peanut, on growth
   and physiology of a subsequent oat (Avena sativa L.) cover crop in both
   a conventional (Peanut-Cotton-Cotton) and sod-based
   (Bahiagrass-Bahiagrass-Peanut-Cotton) rotations. Two rotations with an
   oat cover crop were established in 2000. In the 2006-07 and 2007-08
   growing seasons, oat plant height, leaf chlorophyll and sap NO(3)-N
   concentrations, shoot biomass, and N uptake were determined. Our results
   showed that the previous summer crop in the two rotations significantly
   influenced oat growth and physiology. Oat grown in the sod-based
   rotation had greater biomass, leaf chlorophyll and NO(3)-N
   concentrations as compared with oat grown in the conventional rotation.
   At pre-heading stage, oat in the sod-based rotation had 44\% greater
   biomass and 32\% higher N uptake than oat in the conventional rotation;
   oat following peanut produced 40 to 49\% more biomass and accumulated 27
   to 66\% more N than oat following cotton. Therefore, the sod-based
   rotation improved not only summer crops, but also the winter cover crop.
   Increased oat growth and N status from the sod-based rotation indicated
   greater soil quality and sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Alaboratory study was conducted to evaluate the response of soil enzyme
   activities (namely dehydrogenase, phosphatase and urease) to different
   levels of trace element pollution in soil representative area. The
   improved ecological dose model and random-amplified polymorphic DNA
   (RAPD) were used to assess soil health. The 50\% ecological dose (ED50)
   values modified by toxicant coefficient were calculated from the
   best-fit model, and determination values from the regression analysis
   for the three enzyme activities were studied after the incubation
   periods. The results showed that the elevated heavy metal concentration
   negatively affects the total population size of bacteria and
   actinomycetes and enzymatic activity; dehydrogenase (ED50 = 777) was the
   most sensitive soil enzyme, whereas urease activity (ED50 = 2,857)
   showed the lowest inhibition; combined pollution or elevated toxicant
   level would increase disappearing RAPD bands, and the number of denoting
   polymorphic bands was greater in combined polluted soils. All three
   mathematical modified models satisfactorily described the inhibition of
   soil enzyme activities caused by Cd and Pb, by giving the best fit.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted at Karnal during 2005-07 to evaluate
   the effect of 13 different combinations of integrated plant nutrient
   supply including crop residues, farmyard manure, pressmud, neem-coated
   urea and biofertilizers on productivity and soil health of rice (Oryza
   saliva L.) wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend Fiori \& Paol.) system
   under integrated nutrient supply. Growth and yield attributes of rice,
   viz tillers/m(2), panicle length, number of grains/panicle and 1
   000-grain weight were statistically similar under organic, inorganic and
   integrated plant nutrient supply. The number of days to heading was
   significantly less with the 100\% organic application. Although the
   highest system productivity (9.88 tonnes/ha) was observed in treatment
   100\% inorganic nutrient supply to rice-125\% inorganic nutrient supply
   wheat but taking soil fertility improvement in consideration, the
   treatments, viz 75\% inorganic to rice 100\% inorganic+25\% through
   farmyard manure in wheat (9.22 tonnes/ha), 75\% inorganic + 50\% through
   farmyard manure in rice-100\% inorganic + biofertilizer in wheat (9.36

   neem coated urea + 25\% through rice residue in wheat (9.08 tonnes/ha)
   were found significantly superior than 100\% organic supply through
   farmyard manure in rice wheat (6.82 tonnes/ha) and at par with 100\%
   recommended inorganic nutrient supply in rice wheat (9.43 tonnes/ha).
   Slight improvement in organic carbon status was observed in all
   treatments even in conventional cropping of rice wheat system. NPK
   balance sheet shows that nitrogen (4-206 kg/ha) and phosphorus
   (20.6-185.0 kg/ha) have the positive balance, whereas K shows highly
   negative balance (-130 to -416 kg/ha). K balance was less negative (-130
   to -405 kg/ha) where organic source of nutrient was applied in parts or

Abstract = {{Soil phosphatase and urease activities which are responsible for P and N
   mineralization, respectively, could be indicators of soil health for
   nutrient availability. In this work, we measured the activities of acid
   phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, and non-buffered
   and buffered urease in soils under rainfed and irrigated potato with
   different crop rotation managements. Compared with continuous potato
   (Solanum tuberosum L.) production, three-year rotation practices
   increased all soil enzyme activities in rainfed condition by 10 to 86\%.
   Irrigation increased alkaline phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, and both
   unbuffered and buffered urease activities, but decreased acid
   phosphatase activity compared with no irrigation. Under rainfed
   management, microbial biomass C level was highly correlated with
   phosphatase and urease activities. When measured under buffered
   conditions, urease activity was highly correlated with rainfed potato
   yield. To the extent that urease is an indicator of plant N
   availability, this may reflect the influence of N availability on yield.
   This study showed that both cropping system and water management
   influence the activities of several enzymes considered important for
   plant uptake of N and P.}},

Abstract = {{The influences of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF, Acaulospora spp.
   and Glomus spp.) and rice straw and earthworms (RE, Eisenia foetida) on
   nematode communities and arsenic (As) uptake by maize (Zea mays L.) in
   Ascontaminated soils were examined in a field experiment conducted in
   Wujiang, Jiangsu Province, China. The experiment was designed as a 2 x 2
   factorial with the factors of AMF (inoculated or uninoculated) and RE
   (added or not added). The results demonstrated that AMP inoculation led
   to significantly higher root colonization of AMF and root dry weight.
   Plants inoculated with both AMF and RE had the highest As concentrations
   in root. The number of total nematodes increased with AMF inoculation
   when RE was absent, and decreased with RE addition when AMF was
   inoculated. The improved abundance of nematodes with the AMF treatment
   implied that the tested AMF acted as food sources for fungivores. The
   abundances of omnivores-predators and plant parasites were reduced by
   earthworm activity. Twenty-seven genera of nematodes were identified,
   with Filenchus dominant in all treatments. Trophic diversity,
   Shannon-Weaver diversity, Simpson dominance index, and species richness
   indicated higher species diversity, more proportionate species
   composition, evenly distributed species, and more food sources in the
   AMF, RE, and their interaction treatments. Maturity index showed a
   moderately disturbed environment due to As pollution. Besides enhancing
   plant uptake of contaminants, AMF and RE amendments could also improve
   soil health by restoring the structure of soil communities, as reflected
   by more stable nematode community structure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines if post-fire deferment and periodic rests provided
   by rotational grazing allowed for more rapid recovery of soil cover,
   soil chemical and physical parameters, and vegetation composition after
   summer patch burning than continuous grazing. We evaluated the recovery
   of native rangeland vegetation and soils subjected to summer patch burns
   in continuously and rotationally grazed pastures in 2002, 2003 and 2004.
   Each year, 12\% of each treatment replicate was burned as a single patch
   in a different, non-adjacent area under continuous grazing, and as a
   single paddock of a rotationally grazed 8-pasture-1-herd system.
   Recovery of vegetation and soils on burned patches were measured
   annually until the summer of 2006 and compared to those in immediately
   adjacent unburned areas in both grazing treatments. Herbaceous cover and
   biomass took 2 years to recover to control levels on soils with greater
   mesquite cover and more C(3) grasses, and 3 years on soils with more
   C(4) grasses. The rotational grazing treatment had less bare ground and
   lower soil temperatures on both unburned and burned areas than the
   continuously grazed treatment, which has significant implications for
   infiltration rates, runoff and erosion in favor of the rotational
   management. Soil C and C to N ratios were also higher with rotational
   grazing. Soil physical parameters were not affected by either the burn
   or grazing treatments but the presence of trees reduced soil
   temperature, improved soil physical parameters and infiltration rate
   relative to open grassland. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted during 2004-08 at the Regional Station of
   Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, Kayamkulam, Kerala on root
   (wilt) disease affected palms of West Coast Tall variety. The entire
   field was divided into 2 parts and applied with full dose of fertilizers
   (500:300:1000 g NPK/palm/year) and with 50 \% fertilizers + organic
   manures as vermicompost and incorporation of local variety of green
   manure cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) raised in the palm basin. All
   the coconut palms were indexed for the disease during December May (2005
   to 2008). There was not much variation in the nutrient content in leaves
   of palms under various treatments except P and K which are slightly high
   in palms supplied with both fertilizers and organic manures. Presence of
   higher population of function-specific micro-organisms was found in the
   rhizosphere soils of disease early palms than in the other categories.
   Comparison of treatment after accounting for variations in disease index
   separately for various years was found non-significant. Though the
   post-treatment yield in both the treatments was non-significant, there
   was an increase of 17 \% in yield in palms receiving both fertilizers
   and organic manures compared to 7 \% increase in palms receiving only
   fertilizers. Negative correlation existed between yield and disease
   index in 2005, 2006 and 2007 and was respectively -0.223, -0.268 and
   -0.284 (P<0.05). In general, copra content was higher in palms applied
   with both fertilizers and organic manures and the overall increase was
   4.57 \% over the other treatment. The results indicated that through an
   integrated nutritional management, soil health as well as health of
   palms could be improved over the years or maintained without further
   deterioration.}},

Abstract = {{The climatic conditions of North East India are favorable for trees to
   produce biomass in the form of foliage and twigs that are very rich in
   essential plant nutrients. Effective recycling of this biomass would
   help meet the nutritional requirement of crops. Field experiment was
   conducted in kharif (June-November) seasons for consecutive 3 years
   (2003, 2004, and 2005) at a lowland farm, subtropical Meghalaya (950 m
   asl), India, to study the effect of incorporating N-fixing tree biomass
   (leaves and twigs) on productivity and economics of rice (Oryza sativa
   L.). Fresh biomass from five tree species including erythrina (Erythrina
   indica), acacia (Acacia auriculiformis), alder (Alnus nepalensis), tree
   bean (Parkia roxburghii), and cassia (Cassia siamea) were applied at a
   rate of 10 t/ha. A plot with recommended NPK rate (80:60:40 kg/ha) and a
   control plot were also maintained for comparison. Among the tree species
   used, the biomass of E. indica was superior in terms of N (3.2\%), P
   (0.47\%), K (1.5\%), and organic C (18.8\%) contents. In the first and
   second year, productivity of rice was high with recommended NPK rate
   (4.82 t/ha in 2003 and 5.08 t/ha in 2004) followed by rice with
   incorporation of E. indica biomass. In the third year of the experiment,
   effects of tree biomass incorporation on growth, yield and yield
   attributes surpassed those of the recommended NPK rate, with the
   exception of A. nepalensis biomass. In that year, the maximum grain
   yield was recorded under E. indica treatments, exceeding yields under
   the recommended NPK rate and control by 10.5 and 69.3\%, respectively.
   Incorporation of tree biomass significantly improved (14-19\% N and
   62-83\% P over control) the stocks of soil available N and P. Treatment
   with A. auriculiformis and E. indica biomass resulted in significantly
   higher soil organic C content which exceeded that under the recommended
   NPK rate by 10.3 and 9.2\% and that under the control by 15.2 and 14\%,
   respectively higher by species. The highest net return was recorded with
   the recommended NPK rate (\$ 381/ha) followed by E. indica (\$ 303/ha).
   Since the local farmers are resource poor and rarely use chemical
   fertilizers, application of plant biomass, particularly that of E.
   indica, to lowland rice is a recommendable option to improve
   productivity and income, and to sustain soil health.}},

Abstract = {{Glasshouse experiments were conducted to examine the effects of
   greywater irrigation on the growth of silverbeet plants, their water use
   and changes in soil properties. The experimental treatments included in
   the study were: irrigating with 100\% potable water (Control, treatment
   To), irrigating with 100\% greywater (treatment T(1)), irrigating with a
   mixture of greywater and potable water in 1:1 ratio (treatment T(2)) and
   irrigating alternate with potable water for one irrigation and greywater
   for the next (treatment T(3)). The pH and EC values of the greywater
   used in the study were 10.5 and 1358 mu S/cm respectively. Results
   showed that greywater irrigation had no significant effect on soil total
   N and total P after plant harvest, but there were significant effects on
   the values of soil pH and EC. Furthermore, there were no significant
   effects of greywater irrigation on plant dry biomass, water use and
   number of leaves. For the treatment that involved irrigating with 100\%
   greywater (treatment T1), there was a significant increase in soil pH
   and EC when compared with the control and the other two irrigation
   treatments. The study indicated that irrigating silverbeet plants with
   potable water and greywater in an alternate pattern (treatment T3) had
   soil pH and EC levels similar to that of irrigation with 100\% potable
   water. This also meant that irrigating alternate with potable water and
   greywater could reduce some of the soil health risks associated with the
   reuse of greywater. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A survey was made on certified organic farms in the country to ascertain
   the real benefits and feasibility of organic farming in terms of the
   production potential, economics and soil health in comparison to the
   conventional farms. The study revealed that organic farming, in spite of
   the reduction in crop productivity by 9.2\%, provided higher net profit
   to farmers by 22.0\% compared to conventional farming. This was mainly
   due to the availability of premium price (20-40\%) for the certified
   organic produce and reduction in the cost of cultivation by 11.7\%. In
   cases, where such premium prices were not available and the cost of
   cultivation was higher primarily due to purchased off-farm inputs,
   organic farming was not found economically feasible. However, there was
   an overall improvement in soil quality in terms of various parameters,
   viz. physical, chemical, biological properties, availability of macro-
   and micronutrients, indicating an enhanced soil health and

Abstract = {{Mulching with vegetative materials is a highly beneficial and
   widely-investigated agro-technique in rainfed areas but the adoption of
   this practice has been constrained due to non-availability of mulch
   biomass locally. Live mulching with fast-growing annual green manure
   legumes like sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea) or prunings of Leucaena
   leucocephala grown as hedge rows can be done for moisture conservation
   as well as nutrient cycling in the maize-wheat cropping system, which is
   predominantly followed in the high rainfall sub-mountainous region of
   north-western India. A field experiment was conducted at Selakui,
   Dehradun during 2000-2004 to study the effect of legume mulching, viz.
   in situ grown sunnhemp and Leucaena prunings, along with varying N
   levels, viz. 0, 30, 60 and 90 kg N ha(-1) (to maize), and 0, 40 and 80
   kg N ha(-1) (to wheat) on productivity, soil moisture conservation and
   soil physico-chemical properties. Intercropped sunnhemp added 0.75-1.45
   t dry matter and 21.6-41.3 kg N ha(-1) at 30-35 days, while Leucaena
   twigs added 1.89-4.15 t dry matter and 75.2-161.3 kg N ha(-1) at 60-65
   days of maize growth. Live mulching with sunnhemp or Leucaena biomass
   improved soil moisture content at maize harvest (+1.15-1.57\%) and crop
   productivity by 6.8-8.8\% over no mulching. Combined use of both the
   mulching materials was more effective in improving the soil moisture
   content (+2.08-2.29\%) and grain yield (15.1\%) over their single
   application. Response of maize to N fertilizer application was
   significant up to 90 kg N ha(-1), and it was relatively more pronounced
   under the mulching treatments. Residual effect of mulching on wheat
   showed an increase in yield of 10.2\% with sunnhemp or Leucaena, and
   27.9\% with sunnhemp + Leucaena. There was an improvement in organic C
   and total N status of soil, and a decrease in bulk density associated
   with an increase in infiltration rate due to mulching at the end of 4
   cropping cycles. It was concluded that legume mulching is a highly
   beneficial practice for enhanced moisture and nutrient conservation,
   leading to increased productivity and soil health of maize-wheat
   cropping system under Doon valley conditions of north-western India.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial populations (CFU) have been shown to oscillate in wavelike
   patterns after nutrient impulses in previous studies. The amplitudes and
   periods of oscillations could possibly be used as indicators of soil
   health analogous to the stability and resilience of biological
   populations widely accepted as indicators for ecosystem health. Limited
   plant and animal disease outbreaks can also be viewed as a manifestation
   of a healthy soil ecosystem. Two pot experiments were carried out to
   verify whether damping-off of beet seedlings by Pythium ultimum,
   measured as area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC), fluctuated
   over time after incorporation of organic materials into organic versus
   conventional soils, and to investigate whether daily dynamics of AUDPCs
   were linked to the dynamics of microbial populations and chemical
   parameters. AUDPCs oscillated significantly over time when Pythium
   bioassays were initiated daily after addition of ground grass and clover
   shoots (GC) into unplanted soils. Similar oscillations with significant
   harmonics of AUDPC were also observed in composted manure (CM)-amended
   soils but with smaller amplitudes than in GC-amended soils. The AUDPC
   harmonics in amended soils had periods similar to those of CPU of
   copiotrophic bacteria. Cross-correlation analysis demonstrated that
   periodic fluctuations of P. ultimum infections (AUDPCs) did not coincide
   with those of copiotrophic CPU but were shifted in phase. It appears
   that competition or antagonism from some fast-growing bacteria
   influenced pathogen infections, because these bacterial populations were
   growing and dying. Soil chemical variables, including pH, dissolved
   organic carbon, and NO(3)(-)-N, and NH(4)(+)-N contents, changed
   significantly in the initial 7 days after a nutrient impulse into soils.
   These changes were cross-correlated With copiotrophic CPU with time lags
   of 1 to 2 days but were seldom associated with daily changes in AUDPCs.
   Organically managed soils always had lower AUDPC ratios of amended to
   nonamended treatments. indicating that organic materials showed stronger
   suppressive abilities to P. ultimum in organic than in conventional
   soils. The oscillations in AUDPCs and copiotrophic CPU in amended
   organic soil also had smaller amplitudes than in amended conventional
   soil. These results suggested that organically managed soils had a
   greater resistance and resilience to the disturbance of the amendments
   and, therefore, could be considered healthier than conventionally
   managed soils.}},

Abstract = {{Present investigations were carried out during the year 2006 - 2007 at
   University of Guyana, Georgetown focusing on recycling organic waste
   using vermitechnology and use of vermicompost and vermiwash obtained
   from the vermitech in varied combinations for exploring the effect on
   soil and productivity of Okro (Abelmoschus esculentus) in Guyana. The
   soil quality was monitored during the experiment along with plant growth
   parameters of Okra. The study revealed that combination organic
   fertilizers vermicompost and vermiwash combination compared with control
   and chemical fertilizers had great influence on plant growth parameters.
   The average yield of Okro (A. esculentus) during trial showed a
   significantly greater response in comparison with the control by
   64.27\%. The fruits were found to have a greater percentage of fats and
   protein content when compared with those grown with chemical fertilizers
   by 23.86 and 19.86\% respectively. The combination treatment vermiwash
   and vermicompost combination was also found to have a significant
   influence on the biochemical characteristics of the soil with marked
   improvement in soil micronutrients. The combination treatment was the
   found to be better suggesting qualitative improvement in the physical
   and chemical properties of the soil, which is substantiated by
   composite, index \{Rank 1 for vermicompost and vermiwash combination
   with composite index of 9\}. This biological method of crop cultivation
   is sustainable and improves soil health rather than conventional methods
   based on the earlier observations.}},

Abstract = {{Soil bacterial communities mediate a wide range of ecosystem processes.
   In agricultural systems these processes determine soil health through
   bacterial roles in residue decomposition, nutrient cycling and their
   associations with other organisms. In this study, we investigated the
   abundance and composition of native soil bacterial communities under
   different long-term fertilization practices using quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (DGGE). Soil samples were taken from a 20-year
   fertilization trial at the Plastic-film Mulching Experiment Station in
   Northeast China, which including four treatments of control (CK),
   inorganic-N fertilizer amendment (N), organic manure amendment (M), and
   half fertilizer-N plus half organic manure (M + N), to identify the
   difference of soil bacterial community under inorganic fertilizer and
   manure amendment. The size of the general bacterial population in the N
   treatment was significantly smaller than those in the CK, M and M + N
   treatments. Soil bacterial 16S rRNA gene copy numbers were positively
   correlated with soil pH and total organic carbon (TOC) content. The DGGE
   band patterns in CK, M and M + N treatments demonstrated more similarly
   to each other than to those of soil with only N amendment, while
   canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that the bacterial
   community structure in the N treatment was significantly different from
   the treatments of CK and M bacterial community profiles. Phylogenetic
   analysis of bands excised from the DGGE gels identified seven major
   phyla (Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Proteobacteria,
   Actinobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes) present in all the
   treatments except the N treatment, in which no Gammaproteobacteria was
   observed. Results from this study suggest that agricultural
   fertilization practices have a great impact on soil bacterial community
   size and structure. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the north-eastern regions of India, shifting cultivation is
   traditional and a dominant land use practice, leading to heavy soil
   erosion and severe degradation of biodiversity Agroforestry systems
   (AFS), which have great potential for crop and livestock production, are
   the best alternative to overcome the adverse effects of shifting
   cultivation Agroforestry is an ecologically based, natural resource
   management system that sustains production and beenfits all those who
   use the land by integrating trees on farms and in the agricultural
   landscape In addition to timber, fodder, fuelwood, medicines, etc, it
   conserves natural resources In this paper, the authors discuss the role
   of promising agroforestry systems and various multipurpose trees (MPTs)
   in the conservation of natural resources These systems improved soil
   physical health through checking soil erosion and run-off, maintained
   soil organic matter, enhanced soil chemical and biological properties,
   added nitrogen input by trees and shrubs, and helped in the mining of
   minerals from lower horizons by roots and their recycling through litter
   fall on the ground Of the systems studied, multistoreyed AFS {[}alder +
   tea + black pepper + annual agricultural crops], silvi-horti-pastoral
   {[}alder + pineapple + fodder grasses] and natural forest systems with
   suitable soil conservation measures are the most viable alternatives for
   natural resource management and could sustain long-term soil
   productivity in the highly degraded soil of this region}},

Abstract = {{Weeds are a major obstacle to successful crop production in organic
   farming. Producers may be able to reduce inputs for weed management by
   designing rotations to disrupt population dynamics of weeds.
   Population-based management in conventional farming has reduced
   herbicide use by 50\% because weed density declines in cropland across
   time. In this paper, we suggest a 9-year rotation comprised of perennial
   forages and annual crops that will disrupt weed population growth and
   reduce weed density in organic systems. Lower weed density will also
   improve effectiveness of weed control tactics used for an individual
   crop. The rotation includes 3-year intervals of no-till, which will
   improve both weed population management and soil health. Even though
   this rotation has not been field tested, it provides an example of
   designing rotations to disrupt population dynamics of weeds. Also,
   producers may gain additional benefits of higher crop yield and
   increased nitrogen supply with this rotation design.}},

Abstract = {{Environmentally sustainable potato production requires reduced
   dependence on pesticides. Consumers are increasingly lobbying for the
   protection of the environment, and underscoring these requests by
   changing their purchasing patterns. Farmers are responding with reduced
   and more efficient use of pesticides by means of more environmentally
   friendly chemicals, superior application equipment, scouting, training,
   and increased communications. On our farm, we have focused on
   sustainable potato production for both conventional and certified
   organic with a multi-pronged approach. The most significant improvements
   include weekly scouting of all fields to determine economic thresholds
   before spraying and the reliance on weekly newsletters, which inform us
   of the status of pests and diseases in the province and allow us to
   prepare. We also use neonicotinoid chemistry as a seed tuber treatment,
   which has greatly reduced the need to spray insecticide, especially for
   Colorado Potato Beetle control. We focus on soil health through the use
   of manure (beef and swine), which has led to better crop health and
   further reduces the need for pest and disease control and saves us input
   costs. Finally, we have a potato-variety development program to select
   clones with resistance to Ontario's pests and diseases. The selection
   program focuses on late blight, early dying and scab resistance, as well
   as on research into varieties that resist insects through selecting for
   glandular trichomes.}},

Abstract = {{Italy and Spain are Europe's main peach-producing countries. Since the
   mid-90s, however, peach-growing areas have decreased in Italy thus
   causing its loss of European leadership. One of the reasons for the
   decline is the presence of replant disorders in peach orchards. As
   soil-borne pathogens are one of the biotic components of aetiology, a
   study was performed in an intensively cultivated area of southern Italy,
   to investigate the use of soil fungi as indicators of soil health when
   planting new peach orchards. Soil sampling was carried out in five
   replanted peach orchards and five horticultural sites in the ``Piana del
   Sele{''}, a peach and vegetable-growing valley in the Campania region.
   Three different soil fungi communities were recorded: soil-inhabiting
   filamentous fungi; endophytic root fungi, based on cultural methods; and
   uncultured soil fungi, based on nucleotide sequences of internal
   transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and rDNA gene fragments. Soil health
   was evaluated with a greenhouse bioassay, using young plants of peach
   rootstock GF677. Diversity and composition of fungal communities were
   compared using PAST, a software which includes several functions
   commonly used in paleoecology. Each peach tree orchard was characterized
   by a significantly higher diversity score than horticultural crops. The
   two cultivation systems differed widely for species composition
   suggesting that vegetative cover and cultivation practices strongly
   affected fungal community composition. The bioassay to evaluate soil
   health showed a significant growth reduction in horticultural sites
   compared to peach sites. This finding was supported by the high
   abundance of Cylindrocarpon destructans and Thielviopsis basicola, two
   aggressive root rot agents, within endophytic fungal communities in
   horticultural sites. In this survey, greatest fungal diversity
   corresponds to best plant growth. From a practical point of view, when
   deciding to replant a new fruit tree orchards in intensively cultivated
   areas, a greenhouse bioassay with the target crop, combined with a
   quantitative analysis of endophytic root fungal communities, may help in
   deciding the best soil use. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, organic agriculture has been receiving greater
   attention because of the various problems like deterioration in soil
   health and environmental quality under conventional chemical-intensive
   agriculture. However, little information is available on the comparative
   study related to the impact of use of mineral fertilizers and organic
   manures on the soil quality and productivity. A long-term field
   experiment was initiated in 2001 to monitor some of the important
   soil-quality parameters and productivity under soybean-wheat crop
   rotation. The treatments consisted of 0, 30, and 45 kg N ha(-1) for
   soybean and of 0,120, and 180 kg N ha(-1) for wheat. The entire amount
   of N was supplied to both the crops through urea and farmyard manure
   (FYM) alone or in combination at 1.1 ratio. Results indicated that
   Walkley-and-Black C (WBC; chromic acid-oxidizable) exhibited a marginal
   increase under only organic treatments as compared to control treatment
   (without fertilizers and manure) after completion of five cropping
   cycles In case of labile-C (KMnO(4)-oxidizable) content in soil,
   relatively larger positive changes were recorded under organic, mixed
   inputs (integrated) and mineral fertilizers as compared to WBC. Maximum
   improvement in the values of C-management index (CMI), a measure of soil
   quality was recorded under organic (348-362), followed by mixed inputs
   (268-322) and mineral fertilizers (198-199) as compared to the control
   treatment after completion of five cropping cycles. Similarly there was
   a substantial increase in KCl-extractable N; in Olsen-P; as well as in
   DTPA-extractable Zn, Fe, and Mn under organic treatments. Although
   labile soil C positively contributed to the available N, P, K, Zn, Fe,
   and Mn contents in soil, it did not show any relationship with the grain
   yield. of wheat. After completion of the sixth cropping cycle, organic
   treatments produced 23\% and 39\% lower grain yield of wheat as compared
   to that under urea-treated plots. Relatively higher amount of mineral N
   in soil at critical growth stages and elevated N content in plant under
   mineral-fertilizer treatments compared to FYM treatments were
   responsible for higher yield of wheat under mineral fertilizers.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic digestion of organic matter is gaining importance due to
   interest in biogas recovery, plant nutrient enriched slurry and
   environmental protection. During the past three decade of green
   revolution in India, there is increasing concern about environment
   deterioration and decreasing soil health and fertility. Use of organic
   manure is therefore an essential approach towards restoring environment
   and soil productivity. Biogas slurry enriched with distillery sludge can
   be a new source of organic manure in areas where biogas technology is
   introduced because distillery sludge contains higher quantity of
   nitrogenous compound and methanogenic bacteria. Laboratory scale
   digesters of 4 liters capacity with 2.5 liters working volume were set
   up in batch digestion. Cattle waste was supplemented with 0, 5, 10, 15,
   \& 20\% distillery sludge and digestion was initiated by 10\% inoculum
   from anaerobic digestor plant. Therefore it is concluded that 20\%
   distillery sludge supplementation with cattle dung can be utilized for
   improved biogas recovery as well as potent organic manure.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen is a critical nutrient in plant-based primary production
   systems, therefore measurements of N cycling by microorganisms may add
   value to agricultural soil monitoring programs. Bacterial-mediated
   nitrogen cycling was investigated in soils from two broad land-uses
   (managed and remnant vegetation) across different Soil Orders from three
   geomorphic zones in Victoria, Australia, by examining the abundance of
   the genes amoA and nifH using quantitative polymerase chain reaction
   (qPCR). The aim of the study was to identify parameters influencing
   bacterial populations possessing the genes nifH and amoA, and examine
   their distribution at a regional scale across different management
   treatments. The gene amoA was most abundant in the neutral to slightly
   alkaline surface soils from Calcarosols in North-West Victoria. There
   was a highly significant (P < 0.001) interaction between land-use and
   geomorphic zones in terms of the abundance of amoA. Detection of the
   gene nifH was site specific with low copy number (less than 100 copies
   per nanogram of DNA) observed for some strongly acidic surface soil
   sites in North-East Victoria (Dermosols) and South-West Victoria
   (Sodosols/Chromosols), while nifH was more abundant in selected
   Calcarosols of North-West Victoria. The gene amoA was detected across
   more sites than nifH and was strongly influenced by land-use, with
   almost consistently greater abundance in managed compared to remnant
   sites, particularly for North-West and South-West Victoria. The
   abundance of nifH was not related to land-use, with similar copy numbers
   observed for both managed and remnant sites at some locations. For the
   gene nifH, there was no significant interaction between land-use and
   geomorphic zones, between managed and remnant sites or between the three
   geomorphic zones. Regression tree analysis revealed a number of likely
   soil chemical and microbial variables which may act as drivers of gene
   abundance of amoA and nifH. Variables identified as drivers for amoA
   included pH, Olsen P. microbial biomass carbon, nitrate and total
   nitrogen while for nifH the variables were microbial biomass carbon,
   electrical conductivity, microbial biomass nitrogen, total nitrogen and
   total potassium. Measures of N cycling genes could be used as an
   additional indicator of soil health to assess potential ecosystem
   functions. The spatial scale of the current study demonstrates that a
   landscape approach may assist soil health monitoring programs by
   evaluating N cycle gene abundance in the context of the different
   microbial and chemical conditions related to Soil Order and land-use
   management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The experience and lessons learnt from the green revolution make it
   imperative that sustainable productivity requires strict adherence to
   agricultural practices which ensure integrity of the ecological
   foundations of agriculture. Use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides,
   no doubt, result in enhanced productivity over short periods, but lead
   to degradation of soil health, freshwater and biodiversity in the long
   term. Evergreen revolution defined as achieving productivity in
   perpetuity `without' causing ecological harm involves less dependence on
   chemical and more on biological inputs. With special reference to pest
   management, this article brings out how in a chemical pesticide-free
   environment, the predators and parasites (natural enemies of pests) keep
   the damage caused by crop pests `below economic injury level'. Hence,
   culturing biopesticides (e. g. Trichogramma chilonis, Trathala
   flavo-orbitalis) and releasing them in the crop fields provide
   `pronature', `pro-poor' and `pro-women' solution to reducing loss by
   borers in cotton, brinjal, etc. When these are done by landless women
   who are facilitated to undertake production of biopesticides as an
   ecoenterprise, the famine of rural livelihood is also tackled.
   Scientific, environmental and socio-economic aspects of biopesticides
   have been briefly presented here.}},

Title = {{Examining links between soil management, soil health, and public

Abstract = {{Public expectations of soil management are gradually expanding beyond
   traditional primary production requirements to include diverse ecosystem
   services. In Australia, as in many other countries, the accommodation of
   these new expectations will require shifts in the practice of private
   land managers. In turn. this may require public intervention and the
   expenditure of public funds. However, public net benefits from soil
   management interventions are rarely established, in part due to a lack
   of understanding of the conceptual links between management changes,
   soil health, and associated services and benefits. This paper uses an
   ecosystem services-based approach to examine these links from an
   Australian perspective.
   Entrenchment of the popular soil health concept in field-based
   assessments of agricultural production potential was found to limit the
   concept's applicability to questions of broader public benefit. Without
   expanding soil health to include more ecological indicators, the concept
   risks remaining peripheral to contemporary visions of multiple-outcome
   soil management in Australia. Conceptual and case study links were
   examined between soil properties and processes, soil-based services, and
   private and public net benefits. In this framework, benefits were
   produced from services, and were considered a more tangible point for
   public understanding and valuation than services. The qualitative case
   study highlighted many knowledge gaps relating to non-agricultural
   services and benefits from soils, particularly in the scaling-up of
   sub-paddock measurements, and in the form and constancy of relationships
   among services and benefits. Criteria for identifying priority public
   benefits from soil management were examined, namely, likelihood, degree,
   consequence, scale, direction, time lag, and valuation. Assumptions
   about these criteria require rigorous testing so that the what, where,
   when, and how of public benefits from changed soil management can be
   more clearly defined. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-arid areas comprise a large portion of the world's agricultural
   crop land. These areas are characterised by high temperature and low
   rainfall which hinders soil organic matter accumulation. The reported
   experiments were designed to study the effect of soil organic matter
   (SOM) from green manure crops on soil physical properties in two
   contrasting soils, sandy clay loam and loamy sand under the severe
   conditions of high temperature and low rainfall that exist in the
   eastern wheat belt of Western Australia. To remove soil physical and
   chemical constraints, the soils were deep ripped to 0.4 m after the
   application of 2.5 t/ha of gypsum. Basal fertilizers were applied
   according to soil tests to remove possible nutrient deficiencies.
   Cereals and legume crops were incorporated by disc cultivation into the
   soils as green manure for four consecutive years. Two plant groups,
   cereals and legumes were used to provide green manure. Oat (Avena
   sativa) as a cereal with high C:N ratio (95) and either faba bean (Vicia
   faba), field pea (Pisum sativum) or lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) were
   used as legumes with low C: N ratios (12 - 18). These crops were
   arranged in three treatments for each soil type consisting of different
   crop sequences. A total of between 14 and 20 t/ha of green material was
   incorporated into the top soil over four years. All treatments increased
   soil organic matter significantly compared to the initial soil values
   but no significant differences between treatments (crop sequences) were
   observed. Water stable aggregates and soil bulk density were
   significantly improved by all treatments but no significant differences
   were observed between treatments. Soil water infiltration was not
   significantly increased by the green manure treatments after ripping and
   gypsum addition, though it was significantly different between
   treatments. The SOM increased from around 1.28 to 1.96\%, well below the
   critical value suggested in the literature for more humid areas to
   sustain healthy soil, and not as high as expected from the high quantity
   of green material returned to the soil. However, the levels of organic
   carbon increase were comparable with those predicted from a CSIRO carbon
   model. These results point to the dominant role of soil and weather
   conditions in the low rainfall cropping zone of Western Australia in
   limiting the build-up of soil organic matter content, regardless of
   amount or composition of green manure applied.}},

Abstract = {{This study compared the properties of conventionally managed sugarcane
   soils (sugarcane monoculture, extensive tillage during the replanting
   operation, random traffic from harvest machinery and crop residues
   sometimes burnt) with soils under a new sugarcane farming system based
   on crop rotation, minimum tillage, controlled traffic and residue
   retention. Soils under perennial pasture were included as a standard
   reference. Adjacent fields under the three land management practices
   (new sugarcane, conventional sugarcane and pasture) were sampled at 11
   sites in tropical and sub-tropical Australia and a range of soil
   properties were measured (texture, soil chemical parameters, enzyme
   activity, composition of the nematode community, catabolism of C sources
   using Biolog Ecoplates (R)). For most parameters, differences between
   soils under the new and conventional sugarcane farming system were not
   significant. Pasture soils were markedly different. They had nearly
   twice as much total C, total N, permanganate-oxidisable C and
   water-soluble C as cropped soils and this impacted on their biochemical
   and biological status. Thus cellulase activity and microbial activity
   (measured as the rate of degradation of fluorescein diacetate) were
   respectively five and two times higher in pasture soils than in soils
   cropped to sugarcane. Analysis of nematode assemblages indicated that
   total numbers of free-living nematodes and the ratio of free-living to
   plant-parasitic nematodes were higher in pasture than sugarcane soils
   and that fungal-feeding nematodes were more predominant under pasture
   than sugarcane. These results indicate that the biological status of
   sugarcane soils is poor relative to soils under permanent grass pasture.
   However, sugarcane soils managed under the new farming system for 5-7
   years had a lower C/N ratio, more free-living nematodes and a greater
   proportion of fungivorous to bacterivorous nematodes than conventionally
   managed soils, indicating a shift towards the biological properties of
   pasture soils. Since such improvements in the health of non-tilled
   sugarcane soils are likely to continue for many years, the data obtained
   in this study will be a useful benchmark for future studies. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The beneficial effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on plant
   performance and soil health are essential for the sustainable management
   of agricultural ecosystems. Nevertheless, since the `first green
   revolution', less attention has been given to beneficial soil
   microorganisms in general and to AM fungi in particular. Human society
   benefits from a multitude of resources and processes from natural and
   managed ecosystems, to which AM make a crucial contribution. These
   resources and processes, which are called ecosystem services, include
   products like food and processes like nutrient transfer. Many people
   have been under the illusion that these ecosystem services are free,
   invulnerable and infinitely available; taken for granted as public
   benefits, they lack a formal market and are traditionally absent from
   society's balance sheet. In 1997, a team of researchers from the USA,
   Argentina and the Netherlands put an average price tag of US \$33
   trillion a year on these fundamental ecosystem services. The present
   review highlights the key role that the AM symbiosis can play as an
   ecosystem service provider to guarantee plant productivity and quality
   in emerging systems of sustainable agriculture. The appropriate
   management of ecosystem services rendered by AM will impact on natural
   resource conservation and utilisation with an obvious net gain for human
   society.}},

Abstract = {{Organic farming is frequently touted as being beneficial to soil health
   by increasing microbial community diversity; however; contradictory
   results exist in the literature. In this study, we compared several
   organic and conventional potato farms in Colorado for differences in
   soil nutrients and microbial communities using 454 pyrosequencing of the
   18S ribosomal RNA gene. Organic farms showed a slightly higher diversity
   and evenness within the microbial community compared with conventional
   farms. No difference in the number of observed or estimated total
   operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was observed between management
   strategies. However, the relative abundance of 16 OTUs (3\% genetic
   distance) differed between the organic and conventional farms, with
   seven increasing and nine decreasing in organic farms. A variety of
   known potato fungal pathogens (e.g., Alternaria spp., Ulocladium spp.,
   and Pythium ultimum) were detected in the soil, including three
   different OTUs (3\% genetic distance) with a high homology to the early
   blight pathogen Alternaria solani. Relative abundance for Alternaria
   spp. was higher in conventional farms (relative abundance 30.15 versus
   7.8\%), whereas the relative abundance for P ultimum was higher in
   organic farms (relative abundance 0.25 versus 0.05\%). Quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction, using primers specific for A. solani, Phoma
   foveata, and Pythium ultimum, yielded similar results to the
   pyrosequencing, validating the use of pyrosequencing data for the
   quantification of OTU relative abundances.}},

Abstract = {{Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner), the insect pathogen has been isolated
   from a variety of habitat. It is understood that the habitat of B.
   thuringiensis has always been associated with their biological activity.
   In the present study, B. thuringiensis was isolated from faeces of cows
   and goats. The phenotypic characterization revealed that the B.
   thuringiensis isolates are motile and harbour bipyramidal and spherical
   crystals, which was confirmed by the electron microscopic studies. The
   biochemical characterization confirmed the haemolytic nature and nitrate
   reduction ability of the B. thuringiensis isolates. There is a distinct
   variation in protein profiles among the isolates as revealed by sodium
   dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis.
   From this study we hypothesize that application of cattle manure in
   addition to maintaining the soil health also help augment B.
   thuringiensis population in soil, as a natural biocontrol agent and may
   play a role in the biological nitrogen cycle.}},

Abstract = {{By interviewing farmers in twelve pen-urban and two sugar mill areas
   information was collected on the use of urban wastewater In all cases
   untreated sewage water was used without primary treat merit The domestic
   polluted water originated from household kitchen cloth wash bathroom
   shower and other municipal sources (e g supermarkets restaurants
   offices) Moreover it was often diluted by urban storm-water drainage
   Major quality parameters of the wastewater were determined The boron
   iron sodium nitrogen phosphate and zinc content along with the
   electrical conductivity and pH of the wastewater with few exceptions
   were lower than their safe limits for irrigation The manganese content
   always exceeded the recommended threshold limit Most farmers irrigated
   rice (Oryza sativa L) and in few locations potato (Solanum tuberosum L)
   wheat (Triticum aesrium L) and vegetables (e g tomato Lycopersicon
   esculentum L) with wastewater At one pen-urban area farmers stopped
   irrigating with wastewater after having (free) access to freshwater The
   farmers at another area were very concerned of its negative impact on
   human and soil health Because of high temperature and impurities only
   few farmers used wastewater for irrigating sugarcane (Saccharum sp L)
   and rice by diluting it during the scarcity of freshwater at one sugar
   mill area and only some tail-end farmers directly used it for irrigating
   rice at the other area In this manuscript the word wastewater refers to
   untreated sewage water In Bangladesh water treatment is rare
   Farmers articulated two opposing attitudes for irrigating with
   wastewater They recognized fertility reliability and low cost of
   wastewater in one extent and viewed as negative elements the presence of
   solid wastes fecal matter engine oil grease diesel molasses and harmful
   chemicals in the other extent Also the social acceptability of
   wastewater was low While working with wastewater farmers faced
   multi-facet problems of blistering skin infection injury to hands and
   lower legs bad smell mosquito nuisance and damage to low-lift pumps due
   to solid wastes Important considerations for preferring wastewater were
   to avoid high cost of pumping groundwater and to save on chemical
   fertilizers Also farmers did not perceive any problem with the quality
   of the yield The farmers strongly felt a necessity of primary treatment
   of wastewater to remove solid wastes heavy ones by settling and
   suspended ones by separation before irrigation Although aware of the
   fertility value of wastewater most farmers lacked knowledge on how to
   adjust its doses All these demonstrated a necessity of proper policy
   training and more information on health precautions as well as on food
   safety in using urban wastewater (c) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights

Abstract = {{Humanity requires healthy soil in order to flourish. Soil is central to
   food production, the regulation of greenhouse gases, recreational areas
   such as parks and sports fields and the creation of an environment
   pleasing to the eye. But soil is fragile and easily damaged by
   uninformed management or accidents. One type of damage is contamination
   by chemicals that provide the lifestyles to which the developed world
   has become accustomed. Traditional soil ``clean-up{''} has entailed
   either simple disposal or isolation of contaminated soil. Clearly this
   is not sustainable. Modern remedial techniques apply mineralogical and
   geochemical knowledge to clean up contaminated soil and make it good for
   reuse, rather than simply discarding this precious and finite resource.}},

Abstract = {{An empirical investigation was carried out to study the pattern of
   variability of five soil parameters simultaneously across the villages
   and to group these villages having same pattern by considering data of
   47 villages of Kadana taluka (Panchmahal district) of Gujarat state. The
   data on five soil parameters viz., pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC),
   Organic Carbon (OC), available Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) were
   obtained from Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme. These soil parameters were
   subjected to various statistical analysis. The Analysis of Variance
   (ANOVA) test indicated that the variation due to pH, EC, OC, P and K
   among the villages were highly significant and it indicated that the
   individual parameters were significantly different across the villages.
   The Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) test revealed a
   significant variability pattern between the villages when all the five
   soil parameters were considered simultaneously. Though all the soil
   parameters were found individually significant (ANOVA) as well as when
   considered simultaneously (MANOVA), the Ward's clustering technique
   considered only OC and EC for clustering. Accordingly three clusters
   were formed such that there was homogeneity within the clusters and
   heterogeneity between the clusters. These grouping would be helpful for
   preparing fertility maps as well as for implementing any soil
   improvement programme effectively and efficiently.}},
