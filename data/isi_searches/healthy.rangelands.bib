Abstract = {{Re-establishing native communities that resist exotic weed invasion and
   provide diverse habitat for wildlife are high priorities for restoration
   in sagebrush ecosystems. Native forbs are an important component of
   healthy rangelands in this system, but they are rarely included in
   seedings. Understanding competitive interactions between forb and grass
   seedlings is required to devise seeding strategies that can enhance
   establishment of diverse native species assemblages in degraded
   sagebrush communities. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to examine
   seedling biomass and relative growth rate of common native forb species
   when grown alone or in the presence of a native bunchgrass or an exotic
   annual grass. Forb species included bigseed biscuitroot (Lomatium
   macrocarpum {[}Nutt. ex Torr. \& A. Gray] J.M. Coult. \& Rose),
   sulphur-flower buckwheat (Eriogonum umbellatum Torr.), hoary aster
   (Machaeranthera canescens {[}Pursh] Gray), royal penstemon (Penstemon
   speciosus Douglas ex Lindl.), and Munro's globemallow (Sphaeralcea
   munroana {[}Douglas ex Lindl.] Spach ex Gray); and neighboring grass
   species included bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides {[}Raf.]
   Swezey), Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl); and cheatgrass
   (Bromus tectorum L.). Forbs and grasses were harvested after 6, 9, or 12
   wk of growth for biomass determination and calculation of relative
   growth rates (RGR) of forbs. Neither bunchgrass reduced biomass of any
   forb. RGR was reduced for royal penstemon when grown with either native
   grass and for Munro's globemallow when grown with bottlebrush
   squirreltail. Although only assessed qualitatively, forbs with
   vertically oriented root morphologies exhibited no reduction in RGR when
   grown with native grasses, compared to forbs with dense lateral
   branching, similar to the root morphology of native grasses. Biomass of
   forbs was reduced by 50\% to 91\% and RGR by 37\% to 80\% when grown
   with cheatgrass. Understanding native forb interactions with native
   grasses and cheatgrass will aid land managers in selecting effective
   seed mixes and making better use of costly seed.}},

   through woody plant proliferation: a case study from communal and

Abstract = {{Healthy rangelands are of economic and biodiversity conservation
   importance in the savannas of northern South Africa. The proliferation
   of woody plant species on the rangelands, known as bush encroachment,
   constitutes a degradation of rangeland quality, given the
   non-palatability of the encroaching species. Though the causes are not
   fully understood, heavy grazing and fire suppression are thought to be
   primary causes of bush encroachment. This study utilised multitemporal
   (1994, 2000 and 2008) SPOT images of two rangeland sites in Mokopane,
   South Africa in monitoring and assessing bush encroachment. The study
   sites were a fenced biodiversity conservation rangeland with game
   species in which fire is suppressed and an open access communal
   rangeland grazed by livestock. Field plot-derived encroachment
   categories of heavy encroachment, moderate encroachment, low
   encroachment and non-encroached were used in hybrid classification of
   the images, following radiometric normalisation and geometric
   registration. GIS overlay analysis using the non-encroached category
   enabled the quantification and mapping of change in the preferable open
   grass rangeland typifying savannas. The biodiversity conservation area
   was undergoing a trend of reduction in open grass rangeland, whereas the
   communal rangelands were getting more opened up by livestock trampling.
   Rangeland management practices of fire utilisation, stocking levels and
   stock concentration account for the differing trends. Lightly grazed and
   heavily grazed wild game-utilised rangelands under a fire suppression
   rangeland management regime had bush encroachment rates of approximately
   34\% and 56\%, respectively, in 6 years. Multitemporal remote sensing
   proved to be useful for monitoring bush encroachment as indicator of
   state of savanna rangelands.}},
