Abstract = {{Two experiments were established in 1969 and 1970 near Sidney, NE, to
   determine the effect of moldboard plow (plow), sub-tillage (sub-till),
   and no-tillage (no-till) fallow management on soil properties,
   biological activities, and carbon and nitrogen cycling. One experiment
   was on land which had been broken from sod in 1920, seeded to crested
   wheatgrass {[}Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn.] from 1957 to 1967, and
   cultivated for wheat again in 1967 (Previously Cultivated site). The
   second experiment was established on land that was in native mixed
   prairie sod until 1969 (Native Sod site), and compared the three tillage
   management practices listed above in a winter wheat-fallow system as
   well as replicated plots remaining in sod. Soil sampling done 10-12
   years after these experiments were initiated, indicated that the
   biological environment near the soil surface (0-30 cm) with no-till was
   often cooler and wetter than that with conventional tillage management
   practices, especially moldboard plowing. Biological activity and organic
   C and N reserves were concentrated nearer the soil surface (0-7.6 cm)
   with no-tillage, resulting in greater potential for tie-up of plant
   available N in organic forms. However, regardless of tillage practice
   with wheat-fallow management at either site, long-term (22-27 years)
   losses of soil organic C from surface soil (0-30 cm) ranged from 12 to
   32\% (320-530 kg C ha(-1) year(-1)), respectively, for no-till and
   plowing. These soil C losses were closely approximated by losses
   measured to a depth of 122 cm, indicating that under the cropping,
   tillage, and climatic conditions of this study, soil C changes were
   adequately monitored by sampling to a depth of 30 cm within which most C
   loss occurs. No-till management maintains a protective surface cover of
   residue and partially decomposed materials near the soil surface.
   However, the decline in soil organic matter, and associated degradation
   in soil quality, will likely only be slowed by increasing C inputs to
   soil through use of a more intensive cropping system which increases the
   time of cropping and reduces the time in fallow. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nematodes are the most abundant metazoa. Their food specificity, the
   high number of species and high abundance in every habitat where
   decomposition takes place indicates that the structure of the nematode
   community has a high information content. Since nematodes respond
   rapidly to new resources, and the nematode fauna can be efficiently
   analyzed, the structure of the nematode community offers an instrument
   to assess (changes in) the conditions of soils. A functional grouping of
   nematodes is generally synonymous with allocation into feeding groups.
   However, soil quality assessment indices based on the presence of all
   feeding groups still provide insufficient information regarding the
   functioning of soil ecosystems and their threats. An alternative concept
   of functional groups is based on the life history of nematodes. In this
   paper we present the most recent colonizer-persister allocation and the
   application of this scaling in the Maturity Index, cp-triangles, MI(2-5)
   and PPI/MI-ratio. We propose to integrate the life strategy approach and
   trophic group classification to obtain a better understanding of
   nematode biodiversity and soil functioning. Attention is given to
   competitive exclusion and coexistence and we summarize present concepts
   regarding succession and degradation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Using the pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) concept, this
   article presents a rapid method for detecting toxic effects of
   contaminated soil on soil microbial communities and for elucidating the
   causal relationship between exposure history and toxic effects in
   exposed microbial communities. The method is based on the use of
   multiwell plates (Biolog(R)) for producing concentration versus effect
   relationships for (maximally) 95 different microbial metabolic
   activities. For this, artificial exposure in the multiwell plate is
   established to the contaminant supposedly causing toxic effects in the
   field. The method was rested in a gradient of zinc-contaminated field
   plots by studying community tolerance to zinc. For most substrates the
   metabolic activities showed an increased community tolerance for zinc
   with increased zinc concentration in the field. Consequently, PICT has
   evolved after 2.5 years of zinc exposure under field conditions. The
   perspectives for future use of the PICT concept in combination with the
   multiwell technique for demonstrating ecotoxicological effects at
   contaminated sites is exemplified by the comparison of Dutch soil
   quality criteria for zinc with the collected data. This comparison
   showed that the evolution of microbial-PICT for zinc has occurred at
   environmental concentrations near the Dutch intervention value, a
   quality criterion linked to remediation urgency.}},

Abstract = {{In natural, undisturbed ecosystems the meaning of soil quality should
   express the features of each system in its own pedoclimatic conditions,
   without referring quality to an universal standard of ``healthy{''}
   soil. Forest soil quality may be therefore defined as ``the soil ability
   to match the natural succession of the biocoenosis{''}. This study was
   conducted to test soil quality indicators based on microbial biomass
   activity nn Mediterranean forest soils. The influence of different plant
   communities and management practice on soil characteristics were
   investigated in eight sites on the Tyrrhenic coast near Rome. Metabolic
   quotient, C-CO2 production, microbial C to organic C ratio, C/N ratio,
   Cl estimate and qmC turned out powerful tools to depict both ecosystem
   dynamics and properties.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing use of N fertilizer for crop production necessitates more
   precise estimates of N provided by the soil in order to prevent under-
   or over-fertilization and their adverse effect on plant nutrition and
   environmental quality. Better laboratory tests and models of N
   mineralization are needed to better estimate fertilizer need. Long-term
   changes in N mineralization potential may also identify changes in soil
   quality that relate to favorable sustainable agricultural practices. We
   collected samples from the 0-20 cm soil zone of treatments in five
   long-term (30-60 y old) experiments to determine the effect of crop
   rotation, tillage, fertilizer and residue management on N mineralized
   during aerobic incubation, and compared results with N mineralized under
   field conditions where possible. Soil samples were incubated in glass
   bottles at 25 degrees C and -0.02 MPa for 0, 7, 14, 28 and 49 d. Soil N
   mineralization from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-summerfallow, wheat-pea
   and from wheat-wheat crop rotations were 32. 42 and 51\% of that
   mineralized from non-cultivated pasture soil. Nitrogen mineralized, as a
   fraction of the total N present, increased with increasing N
   application, reduction in tillage intensity and higher frequency of
   cropping. Stubble-mulch soils mineralized 10-20\% more N than did
   moldboard-plowed soils. The fraction of total N mineralized increased
   with increasing soil organic N content, indicating that organic N added
   through recent crop management practices is more labile than N in the
   native soil matrix. Nitrogen mineralization in situ increased linearly
   as a function of past N fertilizer application, which implies that a
   substantial portion of previously-applied N may be recovered slowly over
   time in subsequent crops and that fertilizer N needed for optimum crop
   yield may not be increasing as rapidly as expected. Nitrogen mineralized
   during laboratory incubation also increased linearly with increasing N
   application, but the rate of change differed significantly from that for
   in situ N mineralization (0.0042 vs 0.0112 kg ha(-1) per kg of applied
   N). The difference in N mineralization rate between laboratory and in
   situ experiments is not easily explained; perhaps soil processing for
   incubation altered physical access to organic N pools or caused a shift
   in microbial communities in soil. The difference in N mineralization
   rates implies that laboratory incubations do not accurately reflect N
   mineralization in the field, and strongly suggests that laboratory
   estimates of N mineralization be interpreted with care. Previous N
   fertilization, tillage and cropping patterns all affect N mineralization
   potential, and must be taken into consideration when estimating N
   fertilizer needs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of land use, total metal content and soil parameters on the
   distribution of Cd, Zn, and Cu between the solid phase and soil solution
   is examined in a large field survey. In sifts soil solution samples were
   obtained by centrifugation of field moist soil samples from six depth
   layers (0 to 80 cm) in 30 Dutch forest and arable soils. The soils vary
   in texture, pH, organic matter content, and land use and represent major
   soil types in the Netherlands. Total metal contents in arable soils
   exceeded those of forest soils because of manure and fertilizer
   application and decreased with depth in both land use types, Cd and Zn
   solution concentrations were higher in forest soils and increased
   strongly below pH 5.5 despite the low total metal content. Cu solution
   concentrations were higher in agricultural soils and increased with
   dissolved organic carbon. Multiple linear regression showed that CEC and
   pH explained 49\% (for Cu), 79\% (for Cd), and 83\% (for Zn) of the
   measured variation in distribution coefficients (K(d)). In acid forest
   soils (pH < 4.5; Zn(total) < 10 mg kg(-1); Cd(total) < 0.3 mg kg(-1)),
   80\% of all measured Zn and Cd solution concentrations exceeded current
   ground water quality standards as a result of the high metal solubility
   at low pH. Taking into account the low acid buffering capacities in
   these soils, continuous acidification may cause further increase in the
   soil solution concentration of the metals considered in this paper.

Abstract = {{The benefits of no-tillage (NT) practices to soil organic matter (SOM)
   are inconsistent in fine-textured, poorly drained soils. Tillage imparts
   on SOM were investigated in central Illinois, assuming particulate
   organic matter (POM) would accumulate where SOM aggraded. Soils were
   collected in 1994 and 1995 from a trial established in 1985 at Ferry and
   Monmouth (somewhat poorly drained Aquic Argiudoll silt loams), and
   DeKalb (a poorly drained Typic Haplaquoll silty clay loam). In general,
   NT practices increased SOM-C and POM-C ;contents 25 and 70\% compared
   with conventional till (CT) at the soil surface (0-5 cm). This was at
   the expense of C at depth (5-17.5 cm), which decreased by 4 and 18\%,
   respectively. Tillage effects varied among sites. No-till increased SOM
   C and POM C more than 30 and 100\%, respectively, in the top 5 cm of the
   two silt loams. In the silty clay loam, NT reduced SOM C 14\% in the 5-
   to 17.5-cm depth and POM C more than 20\% in the 5- to 30-cm depth. Bulk
   density was greater under NT than CT at the DeKalb (0-17.5 cm) and
   Monmouth sites (0-5 cm). No-till only increased C and N sequestration,
   assessed on an equivalent mass basis, at Monmouth. Accumulation of POM
   in the surface depth of the NT silt loams may have improved soil quality
   in those erosion-prone soils. Reduced POM contents in the NT silty clay
   loam may reflect SORI degradation. The high clay and organic matter
   content and low bulk density of the DeKalb soil may have contributed to
   the atypical effect of NT practices on SOM at that site.}},

Abstract = {{The activities of many soil animals make a positive contribution to soil
   processes and they should be considered for inclusion in indices of
   `soil quality'. To assess the potential use of nematodes and earthworms
   as indicators, the relationships between populations of earthworms
   (Lumbricidae), total number of nematodes and predacious nematodes
   (Mononchoidea) and six soil physical factors, soil carbon and pH were
   investigated in four New Zealand soils. In each, soil treatments ranged
   from 5-90 year pastures to crapping with maize or barley for 11-29
   years. With increasing cultivation, trends in bulk density, total
   porosity, aggregate stability and concentration of total carbon were
   similar in all four soils. In Manawatu (Dystric Fluventic Eutrochrept)
   and Kairanga (Typic Endoaquept) soils earthworm populations were
   negligible under continuous cropping while Mononchoidea were abundant
   (11 600 and 34 100 m(-2)). In contrast, in Moutoa (Fluvaquentic
   Endoaquoll) and Wakanui (Aquic Ustochrept) soils earthworms persisted
   under cultivation, while Mononchoidea were less abundant (300 and 2500
   m(-2)). At these two latter sites, aggregate stability was higher(1.14
   and 0.92 mm mean weight diameter (MWD)) than in Manawatu and Kairanga
   soils (0.38 and 0.35 mm MWD). These relationships between aggregate
   stability, earthworm abundance and predacious nematodes show not only
   that some potential indicators may have a local rather than national
   application, but also that there are important interactions between soil
   physical properties and soil fauna which require further investigation.

Abstract = {{The nature and pattern of vegetation modification and environmental
   change in the tropical rain forest of southwestern Nigeria were
   examined. The study considered some biotic and edaphic parameters in two
   different areas. The changes were determined by comparing these
   parameters, with those in a tract of mature forest. The results depict
   the extent to which the soil-vegetation system, in the area has been
   disrupted, by both regulations and the activities of peasant farmers.
   The activities of the farmers, have resulted in degradation of the
   structural complexity, of the vegetation and a deterioration of soil
   quality. The changes depicted in this study could only be said to be a
   temporary disruption, if the area is allowed sufficient time to recover.
   Alternative environmental management strategies are suggested. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A field survey was conducted in order to assess a soil quality criterion
   as a tool for the enforcement of the soil protection law of the German
   federal state Baden-Wurttemberg. The law is targeted at protecting the
   soil in its function as a habitat for soil biota. This function may be
   inhibited by soil contamination with heavy metals, e.g. copper. Using
   the abundance of three copper-susceptible endogeic earthworm species as
   indicator of soil impairment in this function, the critical
   concentration of bioavailable copper for mineral soils with pH (CaCl(2))
   values in the range from 4.5-7.5 was derived in a field survey on 52
   sites contaminated with copper fungicides in four areas in
   Baden-Wurttemberg. Area-specific normal abundance of the indicator
   species was established at reference sites. The critical concentration
   was defined as the bioavailable copper content where probability of the
   earthworm coenosis being disturbed is 0.5. NH(4)NO(3)-extractable copper
   was chosen to represent the bioavailable fraction. The portion of metals
   belonging to the bioavailable fraction depends on soil characteristics,
   for copper this is especially organic matter content. A critical
   concentration referring to the bioavailable fraction should need no
   correction for these soil characteristics. In fact, derivation of the
   critical concentration for soils with low and high organic matter
   content separately yielded the same value: 677 mu g/kg. A preliminary
   total copper content was estimated whose surpassing indicates the
   possibility of the critical bioavailable copper content being exceeded.
   Former approaches to derive critical metal concentrations trying to
   extrapolate from the laboratory to the field are critically discussed.

   deposition of total N, P, K, Ca, and Mg through throughfall, stemflow,
   and various components of litterfall was investigated and compared over
   3 consecutive years from January 1989 to December 1991 for both forests.
   The total annual fine litterfall over 3 years of observation was 4.8
   t/ha in a pure plantation conifer forest of Chinese-fir (Cunninghamia
   lanceolata), 7.1 t/ha in a mixed plantation forest of Chinese-fir and
   Schima superba, and 13.3 t/ha in a natural broad-leafed evergreen forest
   of Castanopsis kawakamii, respectively. The contributions of litterfall
   to the total nutrient fluxes were greater than those of throughfall and
   stemflow for all five nutrient elements in two contrasting forests of
   Chinese-fir and C. kawakamii. The results of this study demonstrate that
   natural broad-leafed evergreen forest has a greater capability of
   nutrient return, coupled with higher rates of litter decomposition and
   nutrient release, larger soil nutrient pools, and higher nutrient
   availability, than pure forest, suggesting that conservation of a
   natural forest is a necessary measure for maintaining woodland soil
   quality and primary productivity.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous study, simulations of agricultural production potentials
   were made for different exploratory scenarios considering population
   growth, type of diet and low and high input agriculture. Results
   indicated that future world populations can be fed, but problems are
   likely in South Asia. The simulations involved gross generalizations for
   soil conditions. For example, possible effects of soil degradation were
   not expressed. The current study was made to explore the effects of the
   different types of soil degradation on agricultural production, using
   major soil groupings of the Humid Tropics and Seasonally Dry
   (Sub)Tropics as examples. Degradation (compaction, erosion and
   acidification) is expressed in terms of soil quality indicators relating
   potential to actual production. Results are characteristically different
   for different soil units (genoforms), and the suggestion is made to
   present such differences in future soil databases for phenoforms that
   express effects of different forms of degradation or improvement,
   allowing better assessments for exploratory land use scenarios. Field
   studies should be initiated to describe realistic phenoforms for any
   given genoform. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   order to classify the suitability of the soil formations, for urban
   planning, and correlate their mechanical behaviour with the damages
   observed in the construction.
   According to our observations, a great number of recent buildings were

Abstract = {{Management of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) residue is an important
   consideration in production of double-cropped soybean {[}Glycine max
   (L.) Merr.]; however, little information is available concerning
   long-term effects of wheat-residue management on subsequent crop yield
   and soil quality. A 12-yr study was conducted in southeastern Kansas to
   evaluate the agronomic effects of three wheat-residue management
   practices (moldboard plow, burn then disk, and disk only) on: (i) grain
   yield, seed weight, and leaf nutrient concentrations (N,P,K) of
   double-cropped and full-season soybean and winter wheat in a 2-yr
   cropping rotation; (ii) soil moisture and bulk density at the R5 soybean
   growth stage; and (iii) changes in soil fertility properties (pH,
   organic matter {[}OM], P, and K). Double-cropped soybean yield varied
   with wheat-residue management and available soil moisture, but no
   residue practice was superior in all years. Seed weight and leaf K
   concentration of double-cropped soybean were highest with plowing,
   whereas disking resulted in greater soil bulk density, regardless of
   year. Grain yield, seed weight, and leaf N, P, and K concentrations of
   subsequent full-season soybean and winter wheat were not affected
   significantly by previous wheat residue management. After six 2-yr
   cropping cycles, soil pH, OM, available P, and exchangeable K had
   changed very Little from initial values. In rotations where
   double-cropping occurs only once every 2 or 3 yr,wheat-residue
   management may not have significant longterm effects on subsequent crop
   yield or soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Responses of leaf gas exchange and above-ground growth of beech (Fagus
   sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) to atmospheric CO2
   enrichment (374 mu l l(-1) VS. 590 mu l l(-1)) and increased wet
   deposition of N (5 vs. 50 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)) in combination with two
   natural forest soil types ('acidic' and `calcareous') were studied in
   large open-top chambers. Eight juvenile beech and spruce trees from
   different provenances, together with a ground cover composed of five
   understorey species, were established in each of 32 model ecosystems.
   Both beech and spruce showed sustained enhancement of photosynthesis in
   response to atmospheric CO2 enrichment during the first 2 yr of
   treatment. Nevertheless, switching measurement CO2 concentrations
   revealed partial downward adjustment of photosynthesis in trees grown in
   elevated CO2, beech generally showing more pronounced downward
   adjustment than spruce. The responsiveness of photosynthesis to CO2
   enrichment did not vary significantly among trees from different
   provenances. Stomatal conductance was reduced under elevated CO2 in both
   tree species. In spruce, the radial growth of the main stem and the
   annual production of wood (shoot-wood dry mass of current-year lateral
   shoots), needle dry mass, and assimilation area per tree were stimulated
   both by CO2 enrichment and increased N deposition, but were not
   significantly affected by soil type by year 2. In contrast, in beech,
   the radial growth of the stem and the total leaf number, foliage dry
   mass, and assimilation area per tree were all not significantly affected
   by elevated CO2 and increased N deposition when responses of the two
   soil types were pooled, but were greater on calcareous than on acidic
   soil by year 2. However, CO2 interacted with soil type in beech:
   irrespective of the N deposition rate, saplings showed growth
   stimulation on the calcareous soil but responded negatively to CO2
   enrichment on the acidic soil (where growth was slower). Our results
   suggest that complex interactions between CO2, species and soil quality
   need to be accounted for when attempting to predict forest development
   in a future CO2-rich world.}},

Abstract = {{Morphometric data and general observations of habitat conditions are
   presented for populations of the land planarian Artioposthia triangulata
   at natural and horticultural sites in New Zealand. A considerable
   variation in size structure was apparent, the overall weight range for
   egg capsules being 86 and 396 me fwt (up to a ii-fold difference), and
   that for flatworms being 28-2316 mg fwt (juveniles to adults). The
   number of hatchlings emerging per egg capsule ranged from 1-14.
   Densities as high as 16 flatworms m(-2) and 70 egg capsules m(-2) could
   be found in natural areas beneath pine logs felled just one year
   previously. Densities of 6 flatworms m(-2) and 25 egg capsules m(-2)
   occurred at a horticultural site in Christchurch. The mean individual
   weights of both egg capsules and flatworms were significantly greater at
   natural sites than horticultural sites, this being related to habitat
   conditions (prey availability and micro-climate) and the associated age
   structure of the population. Prey availability appears to be the main
   factor regulating population density. Many similarities between
   indigenous A. triangulata populations in New Zealand and populations
   resulting from accidental introduction in north-west Europe are
   revealed. Although this species is not considered a problem in its
   native land, owing to passive spread via horticultural trade and thereby
   introduction to high suitability habitats, it is Likely to prove a
   threat to introduced European lumbricid populations in gardens and
   agricultural areas in New Zealand, so having implications for soil
   quality. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A long-term biomonitoring programme has been established for many years
   in Baden-Wurttemberg, southern Germany, focussing mainly on
   environmental impacts of pollutants on vegetation and the analysis of
   heavy metals in litter, plant and animal tissue. The soil ecological
   research group at the Staatliches Museum fur Naturkunde, Karlsruhe have
   investigated the soil fauna at 11 selected forest sites within this
   programme with the specific objective of establishing a system of soil
   quality classification based on biological criteria. These sites
   represent different climatic and pedological regions as well as
   different levels of adverse environmental impact. Results relating to
   the incidence of predatory mesostigmatid mites in the study sites are
   reported here. Our methodology begins by ranking mesostigmatid mite taxa
   according to their life-history traits on an r/K-scale. A faunal
   maturity index, which expresses the proportion of species in a community
   with predominantly K attributes to those with more r attributes, can
   then be calculated for the fauna of any particular site. The less
   environmentally perturbed a soil is, the higher the value of this index.
   Comparative norms for the index in different forest types can be deduced
   by analysing published species lists from unperturbed sites. The index
   is a sensitive bioindication tool and a more integrative measure of the
   severity of environmental impact in forest ecosystems than is the more
   traditional measurement of heavy metal concentrations in soil Litter and
   earthworm tissues. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the main applications of geostatistics to the
   description and modeling of the spatial variability of microbiological
   and physico-chemical soil properties. First, basic geostatistical tools
   such as the correlogram and semivariogram are introduced to characterize
   the spatial variability of each attribute separately as well as their
   spatial interactions. Then, the key issue of fitting permissible models
   to experimental semivariograms is addressed for the univariate and
   multivariate situations. Capitalizing on this model of spatial
   dependence, the value of a soil property can be predicted at unsampled
   locations using only observations of this particular property (kriging)
   or incorporating additional information provided by other correlated
   properties (cokriging). Factorial kriging allows one to discriminate the
   different sources of spatial variation in soil on the basis of the scale
   at which they operate, and it often enhances relations between soil
   attributes which were blurred in a traditional correlation analysis
   where the different sources of variations are mixed. Geostatistics can
   also be used to assess the risk of exceeding critical values (regulatory
   thresholds, soil quality criterion) at unsampled locations, and to
   simulate the spatial distribution of attribute values. All the different
   tools are illustrated using two transects of 100 pH and electrical
   conductivity values measured in pasture and forest.}},

Abstract = {{Plant species can influence nitrogen (N) cycling indirectly through the
   feedbacks of litter quality and quantity on soil N transformation rates.
   The goal of this research was to focus on small-scale (within-community)
   variation in soil N cycling associated with two community dominants of
   the moist meadow alpine tundra. Within this community the small-scale
   patchiness of the two most abundant species (Acomastylis rossii and
   Deschampsia caespitosa) provides natural variation in species cover
   within a relatively similar microclimate, thus enabling estimation of
   the effects of plant species on soil N transformation rates. Monthly
   rates of soil N transformalions were dependent on small-scale variation
   in both soil microclimate and species cover. The relative importance of
   species cover compared with soil microclimate increased for months 2 and
   3 of the 3-month growing season. Growing-season net N mineralization
   rates were over ten times greater and nitrification rates were four
   times greater in Deschampsia patches than in Acomastylis patches.
   Variability in litter quality {[}carbon:nitrogen (C:N) and phenolic:N],
   litter quantity (aboveground and fine-root production), and soil quality
   (C:N) was associated with three principal components. Variability
   between the species in litter quality and fine-root Production explained
   31\% of the variation in net N mineralization rates and 36\% of net
   nitrification rates. Site variability across the landscape in
   aboveground production and soil C:N explained 33\% of the variation in
   net N mineralization rates and 21\% of net nitrification rates. Within
   the moist meadow community the high spatial variability in soil N
   transformation rates was associated with differences in the dominant
   species' litter quality and fine-root production. Deschampsia-dominated
   patches consistently had greater soil N transformation rates than did
   Acomastylis-dominated patches across the landscape, despite site
   variability in soil moisture, soil C:N, and aboveground production.
   Plant species appear to be an important control of soil N transformation
   in the alpine tundra, and consequently may influence plant community
   structure and ecosystem function.}},

Abstract = {{Cropping and tillage management can increase atmospheric CO2, N2O, and
   CH4 concentrations, and contribute to global warming and destruction of
   the ozone layer. Fluxes of these gases in vented surface chambers, and
   water filled pore space (WFPS) and temperature of survace soil were
   measured weekly from a long-term winter wheat (Triticum aestivum
   L.)-fallow rotation system under chemical (no-tillage) and mechanical
   tillage (noninversion subtillage at 7 to 10 cm or moldboard plowing to
   15 cm) follow management and compared with those from ``native{''} grass
   sod at Sidney, NE, from March 1993 to July 1995. Cropping, tillage,
   within-field location, time of year, soil temperature, and WFPS
   influenced net greenhouse gas fluxes. Mean annual interrow CO2 emissions
   from wheat-fallow ranged from 6.9 to 20.1 kg C ha(-1) d(-1) and
   generally increased with intensity and degree of tillage (no-till least
   and plow greatest). Nitrous oxide flux averaged <1.2 g N ha(-1) d(-1)
   for sod and 1 to 2 g N ha(-1) d(-1) for wheat-fallow. Tillage during
   fallow increased NIO flux by almost 100\%. Nitrous oxide emissions were
   1.5 to 3.7 times greater from crop row than interrow locations with
   greatest differences occurring during periods of highest N2O emission.
   Mean annual N2O flux over the 3 Jr of study were 1.54 and 0.76 g N
   ha(-1) d(-1) for row and interrow locations. Methane uptake ranged from
   5.9 to 9.9 g C ha(-1) d(-1) and was not influenced by row location.
   Seasonal CO2 and N2O flux, and CH4 uptake ranked as spring greater than
   or equal to summer > autumn > winter. Winter periods accounted for 4 to
   10\% and 3 to 47\% of the annual CO2 and N2O flux, respectively, and 12
   to 21\% of the annual CH4 uptake. Fluxes of CO2 and N2O, and CH4 uptake
   increased linearly with soil temperature. No-till fallow exhibited the
   least threat to deterioration of atmospheric or soil quality as
   reflected by greater CH4 uptake, decreased N2O and CO2 emissions, and
   less loss of soil organic C than tilled soils. However, potential for
   increased C sequestration in this wheat-fallow system is limited due to
   reduced C input from intermittent cropping.}},

Abstract = {{The application of sewage sludge to agricultural soils is practiced to
   minimize landfill disposal. Organic matter amendments to soil are
   generally thought to improve soil quality, but pesticide application to
   these soils may lead to groundwater contamination problems. The
   complexation of pesticides with a water-soluble carrier such as
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) may facilitate chemical movement through
   soil. Sewage sludge amendments may lead to greater downward movement of
   organic chemicals if associated with DOM, Napropamide
   {[}2-alpha-napthoxy)-N,N-diethylpropionamide] was applied to a silt loam
   soil,vith (SS) and without (NoSS) sewage sludge application. Laboratory
   batch equilibrium and soil column studies were performed to determine
   the potential for herbicide complexation with DOM, Over 98\% of the
   herbicide in soil columns followed typical adsorption and transport
   behavior as the center of mass of the lower organic matter soil (NoSS)
   moved twice the depth as that of SS, However, napropamide was detected
   in the initial leachate eluted from repacked soil columns with steps
   taken to prevent preferential now, Napropamide concentrations in the
   initial leachate of SS were twice that from NoSS with <1.5\% of the
   total applied chemical mass eluting from the bottom of each column. A
   strong positive relationship was found between napropamide concentration
   and DOM content in soil leachates, Equilibrium dialysis methods were
   used to determine that napropamide moving through the soil columns was
   complexed with DOM, The results show that DOM can facilitate herbicide
   movement through soil and that sewage sludge-derived DOM mag lead to
   enhanced chemical transport in sludge-amended soils.}},

Abstract = {{There is a need to assess changes in soil quality resulting from
   introduction of conservation practices. This study tested for an effect
   of tillage practice and crop rotation on activity of six soil enzymes
   (dehydrogenase, urease, glutaminase, phosphatase, arylsulfatase, and
   P-glucosidase). Samples of the Ap horizon were collected from adjacent
   no-till and tilled fields. At one site, fields were located on a simple,
   single slope averaging 4\%, and differed in previous cropping history.
   The second site included coarse- and fine-textured soils at lower and
   upper slope positions, respectively. Enzyme activities of field-moist
   samples were measured during two growing seasons, and maximum reaction
   velocity (V-max) values were estimated for three enzymes on a subset of
   ah-dry samples. At the first site, implementation of no-till and
   previous cropping to forages increased activity of all enzymes. At the
   second site, there was no consistent response of enzyme activities to
   tillage practice in the coarse-textured soils, which had relatively
   large total C content. In the fine-textured soil, activity of
   phosphatase and arylsulfatase, and dehydrogenase in the surface (0-8 cm)
   layer, was greater in the no-till field. At this location, these enzyme
   activities were more sensitive than total C (TC) concentration to
   tillage practice, Slope position and time and depth of sampling
   influenced enzyme activities and affected management comparisons.}},

Abstract = {{Cereals grown under irrigation in the Canadian prairies produce large
   amounts of residues. An experiment initiated at the Agriculture and
   Agri-Food Canada Research Centre, Lethbridge, Alberta, in the fall of
   1986, to investigate five straw management treatments (1, chopped
   straw/fall tillage {[}straw incorporated]; 2, chopped straw/spring
   tillage {[}straw incorporated]; 3, straw baled/fall tillage; 4, straw
   baled/spring tillage; 5, straw baled/direct seeding) and three
   fertilizer N rates (0, 100, and 200 kg N ha(-1)) on crop yields under
   irrigation, was sampled in April 1995 to examine the effect of straw
   management and fertilizer additions on selected soil chemical
   characteristics as potential soil quality indicators. If yield is not
   used, can we evaluate soil quality from a soil genesis baseline or is it
   crop growth driven? Differences among straw management and fertility
   treatments have already supplied information on the effects of these
   treatments after 8 yr. The treatment in which the straw was baled and
   the land not tilled had the highest soil bulk density. Total soil
   organic C and N were highest for the straw baled/no tillage treatment
   and the 200 kg N ha(-1) application. Total C was higher for the fall
   than spring tillage treatments, while total N was lower for the spring
   than for the fall tillage treatments when straw was incorporated. Light
   fraction (mg kg(-1) C) was highest for the chopped straw and zero
   fertilizer additions. For several biologically related characteristics,
   e.g., mineralizable N, biomass C, biological index N, and hydrolysable
   N, there were significant interactions between straw management
   treatments and fertility levels. Monosaccharides at the zero fertility
   level were generally of microbial origin, while plant-origin
   monosaccharides were more prevalent as the fertility level increased. It
   is concluded that the present use does not lead to soil erosion, does
   not pollute groundwater, and does grow plants; with the help of outside
   resources, any one straw management treatment can be considered as valid
   in the anthropocentric sense of soil quality. Since the interpretation
   of significant effects of treatment on soil properties must be carefully
   considered depending on the crop selected, the concept of soil quality
   is thus open to question and debate.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of soil quality resulting from a chemical or oil spill
   and/or remediation effort may be obtained by evaluating the toxicity to
   soil organisms. To enhance our understanding of the soil quality
   resulting from laboratory and field oil spill remediation, we have
   assessed three soil toxicity test methods. Heavy, medium and light crude
   oils (API gravity 16-18, 30 and 53) were spiked into two soils in the
   laboratory. The earthworm (Eisenia foetida) 14-d lethality assay, the
   modified Microbics Microtox(R) Solid-Phase assay, and the 14-d plant
   seed germination and growth assays were tested with combinations of
   crude oils and soils. Earthworms were 1.4 to 14 times more sensitive
   than Microtox and 1.3 to >77 times more sensitive than plants to the
   oily soils. Light oil in the silty low organic carbon soil was generally
   the most toxic, while heavy oil in the sandy high organic carbon soil
   was least toxic. The bioassay techniques were demonstrated to be
   sensitive indicators of soil quality and may be used to evaluate the
   quality of remediated oily soils. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Some observations are more variable in space and relatively less
   variable in time or vice versa. Based on the major source of
   variability, regionalized variable theory is used to construct either
   spatial or temporal semivariograms. Examples include georeferenced soil
   data, with primarily spatial variability, and daily weather data, with
   primarily temporal variability, as input to dynamic simulation models.
   However, for the proper interpretation of the output variables resulting
   from these simulations, it is important to describe both their spatial
   and temporal variabilities. A variance model is presented in which time
   is treated as a third dimension added to a two dimensional space. This
   spatio-temporal variance model is used in Case I to construct
   spatio-temporal variograms of hydrologic model output. The
   spatio-temporal variograms were used to examine the differences between
   two calculation schemes involving different hydrologic models. Input
   data to simulation models are based on a certain support size. For each
   support size a semivariogram may be constructed to represent the
   variability. The relationship between the support size of data and the
   distribution of their values can be described by a power function.
   Incorporating the relationship between variance and support size yielded
   a universal variance model relating the variance with lag distance and
   support size. This variance-support model was applied in Case II to
   agronomic yield data obtained from a study focusing on the improvement
   of land use in central Cote d'Ivoire. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Tilled fallow-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (F-W) is the most commonly
   used cropping system in the semiarid Canadian prairie. However, because
   F-W degrades soil, a partial fallow annual legume green manure
   (GM)-wheat system has been proposed as a viable alternative. We
   conducted a 6 yr study to assess the influence of four GM-W systems,
   compared to F-W and continuous wheat (Cont. W), on some soil quality
   attributes, in a medium-textured, Aridic Haploboroll at Swift Current,
   Saskatchewan, Canada. The four GM legumes used were black lentil (Lens
   culinaris Medikus), Tangier flatpea (Lathyrus tingitanus L.), chickling
   vetch (Lathyrus sativus L.) and feedpea (Pisum sativum L.). Analysis of
   soil taken from the 0-10 cm depth after growing wheat in the sixth year,
   showed that most of the soil biochemical and physical attributes
   assessed were significantly improved (compared to F-W) by increasing
   cropping intensity, and by using the GM systems. A sensitivity analysis
   (ratio of other treatment values to value for F-W) showed that Cent. W
   and the GM-W systems increased most pf the soil quality attributes
   tested. Among the GM systems the lentil-W generally increased
   sensitivity the most, while feedpea-W usually increased it the least.
   The labile attributes were more sensitive indicators of changes in soil
   quality than total organic C or N. The sensitivity of the attributes
   decreased in the sequence: Initial potential rate of N mineralization >
   C mineralization > wet aggregate stability > light fraction of soil
   organic matter > total organic C or N. Although the amount of crop
   residue returned to the soil is known to have an important influence on
   soil quality, we were not able to demonstrate this in this short-term
   study. Crown copyright (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{As a major attribute of soil quality, organic matter is responsive to
   agricultural land use practices including tillage. A study was initiated
   in eastern Canada to characterize changes in the masses of organic C and
   total N, and organic matter fractions in forested and adjacent
   cultivated or forage sites. Generally, the cultivated and forage sites
   had denser soil profiles than the forest sites. Based on an equivalent
   soil mass, to accommodate differences in soil bulk density, the paired
   forest and cultivated sites showed that cultivation decreased the mass
   of organic C (35\%) and total N (10\%) in the soil profile of the
   Podzolic soils, but increased organic C (25\%) and total N (37\%) in the
   Brunisolic (Cambisol) and Gleysolic soils. For the Podzolic soils, use
   of forages increased soil stored organic C and N by 55\% and 35\%,
   respectively. Organic C fractions were mainly of significance in the A
   horizon. Soil microbial biomass C was greater in the forested, compared
   to the cultivated soil, but the proportion of soil organic C as
   microbial biomass C (1.3\% to 1.6\%) was similar. The proportion,
   however, was greater (2,1\%) for the forage soil, compared to the
   corresponding cultivated (1.3\%) soil, suggesting that organic C was
   continuing to increase under the former. The relatively large proportion
   (19\%) of organic C found in the light fraction of forest soils in the A
   horizon was decreased (up to 70\%) by cultivation. In contrast, the
   proportion of macro-organic C present in the soil sand fraction was not
   greatly influenced by cultivation. Overall, soils in eastern Canada have
   a relatively large potential to store organic matter. The study
   illustrates the importance of soil type and cultivation interactions for
   maintenance of soil organic matter storage, and the positive influence
   of forages in this regard in agroecosystems. (C) 1998 Agriculture and

Abstract = {{The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was initiated to reduce water and
   wind erosion on marginal, highly erodible croplands by removing them
   from production and planting permanent, soil-conserving vegetation such
   as grass. We conducted a field study at two sites in Wyoming, USA, in
   order to quantify changes in soil C and N of marginal croplands seeded
   to grass, and of native rangeland plowed and cropped to wheat-fallow,
   Field plots were established on a sandy loam site and a clay loam site
   on wheat-fallow cropland that had been in production for 60+ years and
   on adjacent native rangeland. In 1993, 6 years after the study was
   initiated, the surface soil was sampled in 2.5 cm depth increments,
   while the subsurface soil was composited as one depth increment. All
   soil samples were analyzed for total organic C and N, and potential net
   mineralized C and N. After 60+ years of cultivation, surface soils at
   both study sites were 18-26\% lower (by mass) in total organic C and N
   than in the A horizons of adjacent native range. Six years after plowing
   and converting native rangeland to cropland (three wheat-fallow cycles),
   both total and potential net mineralized C and N in the surface soil had
   decreased and NO3-N at all depths had increased to levels found after
   60+ years of cultivation. We estimate that mixing of the surface and
   subsurface soil with tillage accounted for 40-60\% of the decrease in
   surface soil C and N in long-term cultivated fields; in the short-term
   cultivated fields, mixing with tillage may have accounted for 60-75\% of
   the decrease in C, and 30-60\% of the decrease in N. These results
   emphasize the need to evaluate C and N in the entire soil solum, rather
   than in just the surface soil, if actual losses of C and N due to
   cultivation are to be distinguished from vertical redistribution. Five
   years after reestablishing grass on the sandy loam soil, both total and
   potential net mineralized C and N in the surface soil had increased to
   levels equal to or greater than those observed in the A horizon of the
   native range. On the clay loam soil, however, significant increases in
   total organic C were observed only in the surface 2.5 cm of N-fertilized
   grass plots, while total organic N had not significantly increased from
   levels observed in the long-term cultivated fields. (C) 1998 Published

Abstract = {{We examined rates of C, N, and P mineralization in soils from 16
   northern Minnesota wetlands that occur across an
   ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient. Soils were incubated at 30 degrees
   C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 59 wk, and the results were
   fit with a two-pool kinetic model. Additionally, 39 different soil
   quality variables were used in a principal components analysis (PCA) to
   predict mineralization rates.
   Mineralization of C, N, and P differed significantly among wetland
   types, aeration status (aerobic vs. anaerobic), and their interaction
   term. Despite low total soil N and P, there was a rapid turnover of the
   nutrient pools in ombrotrophic sites, particularly under aerobic
   conditions. On a volumetric basis, C and N mineralization increased in a
   predictable manner across the ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient,
   largely due to increasing soil bulk density. However, P mineralization
   per cubic centimeter remained relatively high in the bogs. The higher
   total P content of more minerotrophic soils appears to be offset by
   greater P immobilization due to geochemical sorption, yielding overall
   lower availability.
   Total C turnover rates were relatively similar among sites, despite
   large differences in soil quality. We suggest that, over time, the decay
   rates of organic matter in different wetland communities converge to a
   common rate. In contrast, CH(4) production was extremely low in
   ombrotrophic pests.
   The apparent labile pools of N (N(0)), P (P(0)), and C (C(0)) were
   generally <10\% of their respective total pool sizes, except for P(0) in
   the bogs, which constituted up to 33\% of total soil P. From 10\% to
   87\% of the N, P, and C mineralized after 59 wk was derived from their
   respective labile pools.
   A simple group of variables describing the physical degree of
   decomposition of organic matter was often as good as, or superior to,
   more complicated chemical analyses in predicting C, N, and P
   mineralization. Because pears are classified and mapped according to
   these variables, it should make scaling efforts in landscape analyses
   much more tractable.
   Large differences in mineralization rates in northern wetland
   communities demonstrate that climate change models should not consider
   these areas as homogeneous entities. Our C mineralization results
   suggest that soil respiratory response to climate change (as CO(2) and
   CH(4)) will vary considerably in different wetland communities. Our
   results also suggest that the common perception that more ombrotrophic
   sites are inherently more nutrient deficient needs to be reassessed.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 50\% of the variation in productivity in lakes is
   hypothesized to depend upon the cascading effects of top predators. A
   relative paucity of evidence for such trophic cascades in terrestrial
   systems has prompted proposals that resource availability (donor
   control) is more critical than are top-down forces in structuring
   terrestrial communities, and that trophic cascades with top-down
   dominance will be restricted to systems of low species diversity. To
   test the effects of a fourth trophic level on successive lower trophic
   levels under different levels of plant resource availability, we used
   Piper ant-plants and their associated arthropods as a model system in
   lowland, tropical rain forest. This interacting web of four trophic
   levels is composed of small trees, various herbivores, predaceous ants,
   and specialist clerid beetles as predators of ants.
   Three-hundred-sixty Piper cenocladum cuttings were randomly assigned to
   36 plots with a factorial design: predator treatment (three levels),
   light treatment (two levels), and soil type (two levels). We monitored
   indicators of ant-colony size (percentage petioles occupied per tree),
   herbivore loads (leaf area loss), and tree biomass (total leaf area per
   tree) for 18 mo. When the top predator Tarsobaenus letourneauae was
   added experimentally to the three-trophic-level ant-plant system, the
   average abundance of Pheidole bicornis ants was reduced fivefold,
   average herbivory to Piper cenocladum leaves was increased nearly
   threefold, and tree leaf area was reduced by nearly half. Direct effects
   of predatory beetles on ants were more pronounced and more rapid than
   were indirect effects accumulating to the second and first trophic
   levels. Bottom-up effects of light and soil quality tended to be
   mitigated by these top-down cascades. Neither potential leaf-area
   accumulation by trees nor actual leaf area (left after herbivory) showed
   a direct response to relatively high or low availability of soil
   nutrients or light at different sites.}},

Abstract = {{A better understanding of the soil aggregation process is needed to
   address a variety of concerns, including soil quality and erosion,
   agricultural sustainability, soil C sequestration, the mobility of
   hazardous chemicals and remediation of contaminated sites. We used data
   from a chronosequence of tallgrass prairie restorations and a path
   analysis approach to evaluate how the lengths of two dia size classes of
   fibrous roots, the length of external mycorrhizal hyphae, microbial
   biomass C, hut-water soluble carbohydrate C and soil organic C interact
   to promote the stabilization of soil aggregates. The measured binding
   agents accounted for 88\% of the variation in macroaggregates >212 mu m
   diameter and goodness-of-fit indexes indicated a good practical fit of
   the path model to the data. The restoration of macroaggregate structure
   in this system was apparently driven by the direct and indirect effects
   of roots and external hyphae, with lesser relative contributions by the
   three measured C pools. Although the two root size classes had similar
   direct effects on the percentage of macroaggregates, their indirect
   contributions differed substantially. Fine roots (0.2-1 mm diameter)
   exerted considerable indirect effects via their strong influences on
   external hyphae and microbial biomass C. Very fine roots ( < O.2 mm dia)
   made a stronger contribution to soil organic C than fine roots, but
   their overall indirect contribution to aggregation was minimal. In
   addition, the relative importance of each binding agent varied for
   different size fractions of macroaggregates and generally supported the
   hypothesis that the effectiveness of various binding mechanisms depends
   oil the physical dimensions of the binding agents relative to the
   spatial scales of the aggregate planes of weakness being bridged.

Abstract = {{Artificial soils are increasingly applied in rural development, in urban
   development and landscape management (green areas), and as high value
   substrates. Rural development includes rehabilitation of old quarries,
   construction and vegetalization of grass verges of highways, roads,
   railways and canal edges, vegetated liners of water-stopping dikes, and
   reconstituted soils for covering controlled rubbish tips. Urban
   development and landscape management include reconstituted soils for
   green areas, establishment of street trees in paved sites (design of
   tree pits, preparation of soil, filling of tree pits), and construction
   of sports turf. Production in substrates involves substrates for use in
   glass-houses (market gardening, cut flowers) and substrates for use in
   nurseries (ornamental, forestry). Substrates for green areas also refer
   to vegetated roofs and plants in urban containers. The making of soil
   and control of soil quality involve extraction and processing of sand,
   clay and peat for the above applications, use of waste materials, use of
   compost from green area waste, requirements and calculation methods for
   soil and substrate preparation (norms, standards, and methods for
   inspection). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to many conflicts between buyers and sellers of soil with regard to
   the composition agreed upon versus delivered or made, a need arose for
   generally accepted criteria for moulds used for purposes in urban
   area's. A working group consisting of soil scientists, urban government
   employees concerned with public green, building contractors, and
   landscape gardeners, all of them with practical experience in soil
   related problems in urban environments, brought uniformity in the
   terminology to be used, construction techniques to be applied, and
   criteria for the final soil composition, soil fertility and quality.
   Depending on the type of use, soil composition needs to fall within
   given limits. In addition, requirements for soil fertility are given
   with respect of soil pH, potassium-, phosphorus- and nitrogen content,
   and soil salinity. Furthermore limits are presented for shrinkage on
   drying, soil pollution, final soil compaction and in case the soil is
   constructed by mixing two soils or soil component, the maximum size of
   the composing elements in the final soil. In the paper the research
   results, practical experiences and hinseights that form the basis of the
   criteria, are discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   A study conducted on a clay soil (Udic Haplustert) in southwestern
   Saskatchewan, Canada, to determine the effects of fallow frequency
   {[}fallow-wheat (F-W) vs. continuous wheat (Cont W)] and tillage
   {[}no-tillage (NT) vs. conventional (CT) or minimum tillage (MT)] on
   yields of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), was sampled after 3, 7
   and 11 years to assess changes in selected soil quality attributes.
   Tillage had no effect on amount of crop residues returned to the land,
   but the tilled systems had significantly (P<0.05) lower total organic C
   and N in the 0-7.5 cm soil depth, though not in the 7.5-15 cm depth.
   Further, these differences were observed after only 3 years and
   persisted for the entire II years of the study. For example, in the
   0-7.5 cm depth, organic C in F-W (MT) after 3 years was 10 480 kg ha(-1)
   and in F-W (NT) 13 380 kg ha(-1), while in Cont W (CT) and Cont W (NT)
   corresponding values were 11 310 and 13 400 kg ha(-1), respectively.
   After 11 years, values for F-W (MT) and F-W (NT) were 11 440 and 14 960
   kg ha(-1), respectively, and for Cont W (CT) and Cont W (NT), 12 970 and
   16 140 kg ha(-1), respectively. In contrast to total organic matter, two
   of the more labile soil quality attributes {[}i.e., C mineralization
   (C-min) and N mineralization (N-min)] did not respond to fallow
   frequency until after 7 years and only in the 0-7.5 cm depth. Microbial
   biomass (MB) and the ratio of C-min to MB {[}specific respiratory
   activity (SRA)], two attributes also regarded as labile, were not
   influenced by the treatments even after 11 years. After 11 years, only
   C-min and N-min among the labile soil quality attributes responded to
   the treatments. Surprisingly, the labile attributes were no more
   sensitive to the treatments than was total organic C or N. More research
   is required to determine why responses in this soil differed from those
   reported elsewhere. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{On the Canadian prairies there has been a steady increase in no-till
   seeding coupled with more frequent cropping, facilitated by the greater
   use of snow management to increase stored soil water. Although no-till
   seeding can gradually improve soil conservation and soil quality, it may
   also increase the incidence of grassy weed infestations and thus cause
   more frequent use of costly herbicides, such as glyphosate. Our
   objective was to determine if no-till producers experiencing grassy weed
   problems could introduce pre-seeding tillage for a few years to more
   economically control perennial weeds, without adversely affecting grain
   yield and quality, and soil quality. An experiment in which spring wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown for 9 years with no-tillage management
   on an Orthic Brown Chernozem (Typic Haplobroll) with treatments
   involving snow management and N rate, placement and timing, was
   converted to a study of pre-seeding shallow (5-7.5 cm) tillage with a
   cultivator, versus no-tillage, by replacing the N timing treatment in
   the tenth year. The experiment was then continued for three more years,
   during which we assessed the effect of tillage on weed populations,
   grain yield and N content, and on soil quality. Soil quality was also
   assessed following one more year during which the entire study site was
   summerfallowed and subjected to four tillage operations. Weed
   populations generally were not affected by tillage or snow management
   treatments, but differed among N rate and placement treatments, though
   not in a way that could be easily interpreted. Tillage had no effect on
   yield or grain N content. It increased the erodible fraction of soil
   (dry sieving), but did not affect wet aggregate stability. Neither
   microbial biomass C, nor C and N mineralization were affected by the
   change in tillage method. We conclude that the judicious use of shallow
   pre-seeding tillage in an otherwise no-till cropping system can be
   tolerated to manage persistent grassy weed problems without
   deleteriously influencing soil quality, grain yield or protein. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Differences in mineral nutrient composition of soils have been
   considered to affect health and population characteristics of
   free-ranging animals, particularly herbivores. Contents of Ca, Mg, and K
   in hair of female fawn white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were
   measured for eight consecutive years to determine if soil and annual
   effects occurred in two areas of contrasting soil productivity in
   Illinois. Soil differences may account for some of the autumnal weight
   difference (7.2 kg for 4 yrs of observation) observed in fawn does from
   the areas. Ca, Mg, and K were assayed, because these macronutrients were
   known to differ in soils of the areas and were presumed to differ in
   forages. In 6 of the 8 yrs, at least one element was significantly
   different (P less than or equal to 0.05) between areas. Significant (P
   less than or equal to 0.05) differences for K occurred in 5 yr, for Ca
   in 4 yr, and for Mg in 2 yr. Ca and Mg were lower in hair in 7 yr from
   deer collected from the area in which extractable Ca and Mg were higher
   in soils; that is, hair Ca and Mg levels tended to be inversely related
   to levels of plant-available Ca and Mg in soil. For 7 of the 8 yr, K
   content was lower in hair from the area of lower soil K content. Within
   one area, between-year differences occurred for Ca and K and for Ca and
   Mg in the other area. Between-year differences in diet selection and
   annual climatic effects on mineral uptake of forages, among other
   factors, may account for some of the latter differences. Results for
   hair analyses suggest that macronutrient differences in Ca, Mg, and K
   occur in the diets of these populations and may account for some of the
   weight difference observed between the areas.}},

Abstract = {{Trees in cities face a severe limitation of plantable space and an
   exceptionally stressful growing environment. In Hong Kong, shortage of
   developable land has relegated trees to a lower priority and intensified
   urban impacts on them, relative to other cities. The vicissitudes of
   urban growth and trees since the founding of Hong Kong are reviewed, and
   eleven specific conflicts between urbanization and trees in Hong Kong
   are described. Redevelopment of existing buildings has raised site
   coverage by impervious surface and taken away ground-level planting
   space within and around affected lots. Infilling of relatively
   low-density areas mainly For government and institutional land-uses has
   increased development density and removed existing greenery and planting
   spaces. Road construction and improvement has widely damaged roadside
   trees and removed valuable and conspicuous greenery. Proliferation of
   underground utilities has fuelled the contest for usable space and
   precluded planting in many places. Widespread and frequent roadside
   trenching, associated with utilities and the laying of cable television
   and telecommunication networks has incurred massive root damage at
   roadsides. Poor soil quality commonly beset by chemical and physical
   constraints has caused chronic poor tree performance. Intrusion into
   urban parks and other green enclaves by buildings and roads has usurped
   the limited stock of green spaces. Encroachment into peri-urban
   woodlands has deprived the city of fringing mature greenery with
   conservation, landscape and amenity worth. Plantable space in reclaimed
   lands has been intensively used with inadequate allocation for trees,
   protection and preservation of champion specimens has lacked statutory
   means and a coordinated policy. Reinforcement and demolition of stone
   walls has destroyed many large trees on unique mural habitats. Quality
   of arboricultural practice is poor, particularly in the private sector.
   Possible solutions to these limitations in Hong Kong are suggested, and
   have implications for other cities facing similar problems.}},

Abstract = {{Indicators of the condition and sustainability of agricultural lands in
   five mid-Atlantic states were measured in 1994. Indicators were selected
   to reflect crop productivity and land stewardship on annually harvested
   herbaceous crop (AHHC) land, which covers almost 10\% of the land area
   in this region. Overall, condition of agricultural lands in the region
   is good. Crops generally yielded more than those grown in the 1980s,
   with a mean observed/expected yield index greater than 1. The mean soil
   quality index was slightly better than a ``moderate{''} rating for crop
   growth. Almost 2/3 of the AHHC land is covered by crop rotation plans,
   with the remaining land mostly in hay fields. Insecticides were applied
   to less than 20\% of AHHC land, and less than 20\% of the land where
   pesticides were applied has high to moderately high potential for
   pesticides leaching into groundwater. However, integrated pest
   management (IPM) is practiced on less than 20\% of AHHC land. Hay showed
   more efficient use of nitrogen than seed crops, and non-tilled sites,
   which are mostly hay, had more microbial biomass (suggesting more
   nutrient cycling) than tilled sites. This information could provide a
   baseline for a long-term monitoring program for agroecosystems in the
   region.}},

   offer alternative knowledge for combating desertification. The resulting
   agriculture is sustainable as well as culturally and environmentally

   system at the Zuni Indian Reservation, New Mexico. The approach links
   agroecology and ethnoscience research to grassroots community action.
   Agroecology research has revealed enhanced soil quality in traditional
   runoff agricultural fields, while ethnoscience shows a subtle
   understanding of local soils and geomorphology. The research supports
   community action by recognizing and valuing a local agricultural system
   so that solutions to land degradation can build on indigenous knowledge.

Abstract = {{Recently some networks for monitoring the soil quality have enriched the
   world of environmental quality assessment. Formerly such networks were
   considered not worthwhile because the spatial variability of the soil
   compartment was regarded too large to detect trends in soil quality.
   However, research suggested that with a statistically sound network
   design it should be possible to detect relevant trends. As a result,
   national and provincial authorities in the Netherlands began to set up
   soil monitoring networks in the early 1990s. These networks cover the
   rural areas and mainly focus on three environmental aspects of the soil,
   namely: spread of contaminants (heavy metals, pesticides, PCB, etc.),
   and eutrophication and acidification. The goals are the assessment of
   the current soil quality of rural areas and the development of this
   quality. An evaluation of the first 5 years of monitoring yields much
   useful information. Naturally, after the evaluation of the first
   results, optimization of the organization and design of these networks
   must be considered. Topics discussed in this paper include sampling
   technique, sampling design and the maintenance of sample archives.
   Topics of a different category are the concept of homogeneous
   subregions, the idea of fixed monitoring locations versus a flexible
   network, seasonal variation and its influence on monitoring, and finally
   the choice of measured parameters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Stubble mulch tillage (SMT) and no-tillage (NT) are well adapted for
   dryland crops in the US Great Plains. Long-term use of NT, however, may
   impair soil physical conditions and crop yields, and, by inference, soil
   quality and production sustainability. We determined effects of using
   SMT and NT in several cropping systems for dryland winter wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench)
   production on soil bulk density (BD), penetration resistance (PR), and
   water content (WC). We determined these in 1994 in plots of a tillage
   method and cropping system study started in 1982 on Pullman (Torrertic
   Paleustoll) clay loam at Bushland, TX, USA. Due to the nature of the
   study, a common statistical analysis of the data was not appropriate,
   but eight separate analyses were possible. Besides tillage method and
   cropping system, these allowed comparisons due to rotation phase, land
   condition (level or non-level), and crop grown. Soil ED and PR always
   increased with depth and WC often increased. The tillage x depth
   interaction effect also was significant. Soil ED and PR were lower in
   the tillage layer (0-10 cm depth) in SMT than in NT plots, but no
   definite trends for ED were evident below 10 cm. Based on regression
   analyses, PR with SMT was related to ED and WC of the entire profile and
   most depth increments. With NT, PR was related to profile ED and WC, but
   only to WC for individual depths. These results indicate some strength
   factor largely independent of ED and affected by WC strongly influences
   PR of NT soil. Because NT does not disturb the soil, we concluded that
   stable biopores created by soil organisms and root channels reduced the
   effects of ED differences among NT plots and that NT soils developed a
   rigid structure independent of ED. Reports of improved trafficability on
   NT soils support this conclusion. Results of this study and previously
   reported crop yields suggest long-term use of NT will not impair the
   quality and production sustainability of this and similar soils under
   dryland cropping conditions. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   lowered soil enzyme activities in the organic layers as compared to the

Abstract = {{To assess soil fertility or quality three controlling components - its
   physical, chemical and biological nature - have to be considered. In
   this study a broad spectrum of agricultural soils from Sweden were
   cropped with ryegrass in pots under standardized conditions in climate
   chambers. Measurements of physical, chemical and biological attributes
   of soil were used to predict C and N yields by simple correlation and
   the multivariate calibration techniques, principal component analysis
   combined with multiple linear regression, and partial least squares
   (PLS) regression. The N yields were typically more accurately predicted
   than the corresponding C yields. The best single predictor of yields was
   always total soil N, but estimates produced by multivariate models
   including organic C, total N, C/N ratio, coarse silt, potential
   denitrification activity, N mineralization. substrate-induced
   respiration and sample site humidity were, in all cases, substantially
   more accurate. Coefficients of correlation bet it een predicted and
   measured C or N yields ranged between 0.61 and 0.80 with total N as
   predictor, and between 0.69 and 0.97 with the multivariate models. Both
   quantitative and qualitative aspects of the organic matter were
   considered to be important with respect to the predictive ability. Both
   these aspects were accounted for by the multivariate models. The
   multivariate technique, PLS regression, facilitated the classification
   of soils into categories of good, normal or poor fertility in relation
   to their organic matter content.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of suppressing couch grass (Elytrigia repens L.), through
   integrated management, on soil biological quality and N and P nutrition
   of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were evaluated in a field experiment
   (1987-92) on a Dark Grey soil in Alberta, Canada. The management
   practices consisted of combinations of herbicide application, crop
   rotations and tillage treatments. The 3-year crop sequences consisted of
   continuous barley, canola (Brassica rapa L.)-barley-barley,
   fallow-barley-barley, and barley or canola undersown with red clover
   (Trifolium pratense L.)-red clover green manure-barley. In 1992, the
   sixth year of the experiment, soil and plant samples were analysed for
   nutrient content. Treatments that consisted of spring and autumn tillage
   only did not suppress couch grass and produced low barley yields and N
   and P uptake. More N was immobilized in couch grass shoots and rhizomes
   and soil microbial biomass with these treatments than with similar
   herbicide-treated crop rotations. Tillage-plus-herbicide treatments
   effectively suppressed couch grass and enabled the barley crop to
   compete for soil N, however, both spring and autumn tillage were
   required for weed control. The fallow treatment impaired soil quality by
   reducing soil and microbial C and N, but produced similar barley yields
   as continuous cropping with tillage-plus-chemical control. Red clover
   ploughed in for green manure enhanced soil quality indicators such as
   soil and microbial biomass C, total and mineralizable soil N, and
   microbial N, but did not increase barley yield compared to continuous
   grain cropping.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy metal contamination can impact soil ecosystems sufficiently to
   result in significant losses in soil quality, The negative impact of
   heavy metals results from their toxicity to biological processes,
   including processes catalyzed by soil microorganisms. Therefore, it is
   postulated that the soil microbial community could serve as an indicator
   of losses in soil quality due to heavy metal contamination and of
   changes in soil quality resulting from reclamation. In this study, the
   size, activity, and structure of microbial communities from remediated
   and unremediated soils in the vicinity of a Zn smelter were evaluated.
   Both total and soluble metal loadings in these soils increased with
   proximity to the smelter. Indicators of microbial activity
   (dehydrogenase activity) and viable population size (plate counts) were
   negatively affected by the elevated metal levels, Microbial community
   structure also varied with increasing contamination, as indicated by
   cluster analysis and principal component analysis of BIOLOG community
   metabolic profiles, Remediated soils at this site were treated by
   surface application of a mixture of sewage sludge and fly ash,
   Remediation resulted in a decrease in soluble metals and an increase in
   indicators of biological activity and viable population size. Remediated
   soils also showed metabolic profiles that were more similar to the least
   contaminated site, suggesting recovery of the microbial populations.
   These data suggest that the microbial community may be a useful
   indicator of changes in soil quality with management of these highly
   contaminated soils.}},

Abstract = {{Tillage and soil management effects on soil physical and chemical
   qualities were monitored for eight years from 1979 through 1987 in a
   long-term experiment involving 17 consecutive crops of maize. Effects of
   no-till and plow-till methods of seedbed preparation were compared at
   two levels of residue management (residue removed versus residue
   returned) and two levels of fertilizer application (without fertilizer
   versus recommended fertilizer). Soil chemical quality was better for
   no-till compared with plow-till methods. Mean soil chemical properties
   of 0-5 cm depth for no-till and plow-till treatments respectively were
   18.6 g kg(-1) versus 12.2 g kg(-1) for soil organic carbon content, 1.9
   g kg(-1) versus 1.1 g kg(-1) for total soil nitrogen, 0.14 units yr(-1)
   versus 0.18 units yr(-1) rate of decline in soil pH, 63.1 mg kg(-1)
   versus 31.8 mg kg(-1) for Bray-P, and 6 0 cmol kg(-1) Versus 2.3 cmol
   kg(-1) for Ca+2. Soil chemical quality consistently declined, although
   the rate of decline differed among tillage and fertilizer treatments.
   There were also differences in soil physical quality. Soil bulk density
   increased with cultivation duration in both tillage methods, and use of
   furadan in no-till plots drastically increased soil bulk density.
   Infiltration rate and soil moisture retention at all suctions was
   consistently more for no-till than plow-till treatments. Decline in soil
   quality with cultivation was reflected in decrease in crop yields. (C)

Abstract = {{Soil quality under irrigation in the Senegal River Valley may become
   affected by salinization (Delta) and alkalinization (Middle Valley)
   processes. The salinity status of 158 irrigated rice fields in the Delta
   was measured with an electromagnetic conductivity meter (EM38).
   Double-cropped fields (two rice crops per year on the same field) were
   least saline (average horizontal EM38 reading: 0.6 dS m(-1)), followed
   by single-cropped drained fields (1.6 dS m(-1)), single-cropped
   non-drained fields (2.5 dS m(-1)), non-cropped sites outside irrigation
   schemes (4.7 dS m(-1)) and abandoned fields (5.7 dS m(-1)). Results
   illustrated that when cultivating rice in the Delta, the ponded water on
   the soil surface blocks capillary rise of salt from the water table.
   In the Valley, the difference in the total amount of carbonates in 1:50
   soil extracts between cultivated and non-cultivated sites was used as an
   indicator for alkalinization risk in 27 irrigation schemes. Highest
   rates of carbonate accumulation (0.65 meg HCO3- (kg soil)(-1) cropping
   season(-1)) and, therefore, greatest soil degradation risk were observed
   in schemes without drainage, compared to 0.10 meg HCO3- (kg soil)(-1)
   cropping season(-1) in schemes with good irrigation and drainage
   facilities. Plot and scheme level recommendations that may pre serve
   soil quality under irrigation are presented.}},

Journal = {{PLANT AND SOIL}},

Pages = {{97-107}},

Abstract = {{Soil microbiological and soil biochemical parameters (pH, exchangeable
   basic cations, inorganic and organic phosphorus pools, total organic
   carbon and total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon, acid and alkaline
   phosphatase, beta-glucosidase and protease activity) were identified as
   indicators of soil quality under improved fallow management systems with
   senna, leucaena and pueraria on severely degraded and non-degraded soil.
   Principal component analysis demonstrated that soil organic matter
   related nutrient dynamics was the major contributor to explain the total
   variance (>80\%) of the sites under the prevailing experimental
   conditions. Highest loadings with the major principal component were
   provided by microbial biomass, alkaline phosphatase, total N,
   beta-glucosidase and organic C. Contrasting fallow management systems
   (alley cropping, live mulch, planted fallow, controls in long-term
   experiments) at three sites differing in degree of soil degradation
   could be evaluated adequately by these indicators. beta-Glucosidase
   indicated soil quality changes better than total organic carbon.
   Alkaline phosphatase was more sensitive than microbial biomass in
   characterizing the effects of improved fallow management on site
   degradation. Acid phosphatase and protease were not considered sensitive
   indicators for soil quality evaluations of these long-term management
   trials. Pueraria sustained soil quality on the non-degraded site but did
   not improve the severely degraded site, suggesting that pueraria is a
   soil fertility maintenance crop. In contrast, senna improved the
   degraded sites and more so on the most severely degraded site.
   Apparently, senna can be considered a suitable candidate for soil
   restoration purposes.}},

Abstract = {{In some Pleistocene soils, forestry practices on sustainability were
   started 80 years ago. On outwash plains the pine forests were changed
   into pine-beech forests ({''}Zweistufenwald{''}). On moraines,
   pine-oak-beech forests ({''}Dreistufenwald{''}) were created.
   Litter decomposition and carbon mineralization were significantly higher
   in the more natural, mainly deciduous ``Dreistufenwald{''} than in the
   pine forest (p less than or equal to 0.01), while C/N ratio was lower (p
   less than or equal to 0.001). Nutrient availability (K+, Mg++, Ca++,
   P2O5) increased, whereas the concentration of Al3+ ions was reduced to
   about one-third of that of the pine forest (p less than or equal to
   0.001). Higher values of microbial biomass were obtained from the soil
   of the ``Dreistufenwald{''}. The increase in microbial biomass was
   mainly due to higher fungal colonization. Soil respiration (mu g
   CO2-C/g{*}h), specific microbial respiration (mu g CO2-C/mg C-mic{*}h)
   and carbon mineralization (mu g CO2-C/mg C-org{*}d) were significantly
   higher in the mixed forest during the entire investigation (p less than
   or equal to 0.01). Furthermore, the abundance of the soil fauna
   increased in comparison to the coniferous forest. This observation was
   made concerning the macroinvertebrates (Lumbricidae) as well as the
   mesofauna (Enchytraeidae, Collembola, Oribatei). With respect to
   earthworms, the number of species and the biomass was higher for all
   ecotypes.
   In the ``Zweistufernwald{''} on outwash plains no improved soil
   characteristics could be detected. Litter decomposition was even lower
   than in the coniferous sites (p less than or equal to 0.001) and the
   concentration of Al3+ was higher (p less than or equal to 0.001). In the
   pine-beech forest, microbial biomass and soil respiration were only
   slightly higher. The biomass of the soil fauna did not differ
   significantly (p > 0.05) in most cases.
   Changes in decomposition rates were mainly due to the soil type and to
   interactions between soil and stocking (ANOVA). Both, soil and stocking
   influenced the microbial characteristics of the soils and the biomass of
   Collembola and Oribatei (p less than or equal to 0.001). Differences in
   the abundance of Enchytraeidae depended on the soil and the interaction
   of soil and stocking, while the abundance of earthworms could be
   explained solely by the soil (p less than or equal to 0.001). Analysis
   of covariance uncovered the significance of the soil fauna for the
   increase in soil respiration, specific microbial respiration and carbon
   mineralization.
   Moreover, soil fauna and soil microbes biased the C/N ratio, nutrient
   availability (K+, Mg++, Ca++, P2O5) and the concentration of Al3+ ions.
   A remarkable correlation occured between high biotic activity, increase
   in pH-values and decrease in concentrations of Al3+ ions in the more
   natural, mainly deciduous forest.}},

Abstract = {{Soil and land quality indicators play an important role in the
   assessment and evaluation of soil and land quality. In contrast with the
   general definitions of soil and land quality, working with indicators
   demands a better awareness of at which scale level measurements were
   made, at which scale calculations and models were developed and
   validated, and at which scale answers are needed. We propose that soil
   and land quality indicators may be classified by three characteristics:
   1) scale level, 2) complexity, and 3) transferability. Each
   characteristic is represented by an axis in the Soil and Land Quality
   Indicator Diagram.
   Indicators with a high complexity can not be measured directly, but need
   to be calculated with one or more models, eg. pedotransfer functions and
   hydrological simulation models. For the application of the indicator it
   is then important to know how the indicator value was obtained, i.e.
   which models were used. A specific sequence of models used for obtaining
   an indicator value is called a `research chain' and is indicated in the
   Scale Hierarchy and Knowledge Type Diagram. The use of research chains
   allows the user to consider and evaluate alternative options for the
   assessment of a specific indicator.
   In this study values for three soil quality indicators were obtained
   through two alternative research chains. The research chains differed by
   the choice of used pedotransfer functions and soil hydrological models.
   The two research chains yielded for each of the three indicators two
   sets of thirty year averages for 166 locations in the study area. Per
   location the obtained indicator values were compared with a t-test. The
   research chains were found to yield significantly different values for
   all three indicators.
   The spatial and temporal variability of the data was analyzed for each
   step, i.e. per model, along both research chains. Alternative models
   yielded different spatial and temporal variability structures.
   Therefore, the choice of research chain not only affects the mean value
   of an indicator, but also the associated spatial and temporal
   variability structure. Knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability
   is important for upscaling purposes.
   Based on these results we conclude that the successful application of
   soil and land quality indicators depends on:
   1) the definition of suitable indicators based on scale level,
   complexity, and transferability;
   2) the careful selection and definition of research chains; and
   3) the combined presentation of indicator values and used research
   chains.}},

Abstract = {{Results from the ``Potato Ecosystem Project,{''} a cropping systems
   study in northern Maine, were used to test the hypothesis that greater
   reliance on organic nutrient sources and less reliance on synthetic
   fertilizer sources can benefit weed management efforts. `Atlantic'
   potato was grown in a 2-yr rotation within a factorial arrangement of
   three pest management systems, two soil management systems, and both
   rotation entry points. Weed control in the conventional (CONV) pest
   management system relied on full rates of herbicides, whereas the
   biointensive (BIO) system relied exclusively on cultivation. The reduced
   input (RI) pest management system relied on cultivation in 1991 and 1992
   and on 50\% of standard herbicide rates plus cultivation from 1993 to
   1995. The two soil management systems, unamended (barley/red clover
   rotation crop; 1x synthetic fertilizer for potato) and amended
   (pea/oat/hairy vetch green manure rotation crop; manure, compost, and
   0.5x synthetic fertilizer for potato) contrasted practices typical for
   the region to those designed to achieve rapid improvements in soil
   quality. Midseason weed biomass in potato was dominated by common
   lambsquarters. In 1991 and 1992, weed biomass in potato was least in the
   CONV system and did not differ between the RI and BIO systems. In 1993,
   weeds in both RI and CONV potatoes were effectively suppressed below the
   level measured in the BIO system. Soil management had no effect on weed
   biomass from 1991 to 1993 but became an important factor affecting weeds
   in the BIO system in 1994 and 1995. Weed biomass was 77\% lower in 1994
   and 72\% lower in 1995 in the amended soil management system than in the
   unamended system. No significant yield loss due to weeds was detected in
   the 1994 BIO system, but in 1995 yield loss due to weeds was 37\% in the
   unamended system compared to 12\% in the amended system. Soil management
   effects on weeds in the 1994 BIO pest management system carried through
   to the following season's germinable seed bank. Density of germinable
   common lambsquarters seed (0 to 10 cm soil depth) in the 1995 BIO system
   was 4,082 m(-2) in the unamended soil management system compared to
   1,280 m(-2) in the amended soil management system. We suggest that
   organic amendments and green manure promote a potato crop better able to
   compete with weeds and that these inputs be considered as potentially
   important components of integrated weed management systems that have
   minimal reliance on herbicides.}},

Abstract = {{The economic well-being of most of the nations on earth depends greatly
   on arable soils and how well their productivity is maintained. Soil
   quality can improve or deteriorate depending on influencing factors.
   There is a need of tools to interpret the different soil quality data as
   well as a strategy for an evaluation that gives a quality picture for a
   specific soil. A strategy for an integrated evaluation of soil quality
   is suggested. The different indicators used are such that they reflect
   biological, chemical, and physical components of the soil. Information
   about climatic conditions as well as data concerning cultivation
   measures, previous and present, should be included. Principal component
   analysis (PCA) is needed to evaluate the complex data sets compiled from
   all these variables.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of biological processes for soil functioning is
   frequently stressed. In spite of this, the biological soil component has
   seldom been used to assess soil quality, while optimal and threshold
   values have been identified for many physical and chemical soil
   parameters. In this investigation, the variation in a number of
   microbiological, chemical and physical variables was studied on two
   scales. Small scales were studied with 52 samples from a single
   agricultural field, and large scales with a set of 26 samples from very
   diverse agricultural sites in Sweden. In addition, the functional
   structures of the two scales were studied by means of principal
   component analysis (PCA). The two scales had more similarities than
   dissimilarities regarding variable variation and functional structures.
   The relationships between variables were, however, more blurred in the
   large than in the small scales as the influences of soil structure,
   climate and cropping practice were larger. The possibilities to reduce
   the number of variables without loss of vital information about the soil
   system are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi constitute a living bridge for the
   transport of nutrients from soil to plant roots, and are considered as
   the group of soil microorganisms that is of most direct importance to
   nutrient uptake by herbaceous plants. AM fungi also contribute to the
   formation of soil aggregates and to the protection of plants against
   drought and root pathogens. Assessment of soil quality, defined as the
   capacity of a soil to function within ecosystem boundaries to sustain
   biological productivity, maintain environmental quality, and promote
   plant health, should therefore include both quantitative and qualitative
   measurements of this important biological resource. Various methods for
   the assessment of the potential for mycorrhiza formation and function
   are presented. Examples are given of the application of these methods to
   assess the impact of pesticides on the mycorrhiza.}},

Abstract = {{Soil protection is an international concern. Due to the irreversible
   deterioration of soils by persistent contaminants and physical erosion,
   policymakers and scientists in many countries are beginning to realize
   that the soil environment is a limited resource. Therefore a number of
   countries and international bodies have developed policies to protect
   their soils generically or dependent on land use. That does not
   implicitly mean generic versus land-use based protection policies; on
   the contrary these approaches are complementary to each other. This
   complementarity is further illustrated in this paper. A basic approach
   is given to what soils, quality, and assessment mean in relation to soil
   protection, followed by a description of various soil functions, and the
   way these are applied in soil protection regulations in various
   countries. In order to reach an integrated soil risk assessment, a
   number of research activities have been started in Europe. These are
   briefly described together with recommendations for further activities.}},

Volume = {{78}},

Abstract = {{A field trial was designed to test the potential of various wastes as
   soil amendments in horticultural production. Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris
   L.) and carrot (Daucas carota L.) were grown during 1993-1995 under
   irrigation in a coarse-textured, British Columbia soil to which annual
   applications of 45 t ha(-1) of various organic amendments plus
   NPK-fertilizers had been applied. The amendments included biosolids from
   Vancouver, Kelowna and Penticton, biowastes from Aldergrove and
   Abbotsford, and peat. Yield of both chard and carrot was increased for
   some organic treatments plus fertilizer relative to plots receiving
   commercially recommended rates of NPK-fertilizer only (control plots).
   Leaf N, P, Zn and Cu concentrations of both crops were usually elevated,
   but not to toxic values, in plots receiving wastes containing high
   concentrations of the respective nutrients. By the end of the third
   growing season, extractable P, Zn and Cu increased in the surface 15 cm
   of soil, relative to control plots, with P and Cu increases evident to
   30 cm depth. Extractable K and pH varied, with applied waste with some
   treatments having higher and other treatments lower values than in
   control plots. The cumulative evidence suggested that many locally
   produced biosolids and biowastes have the potential to improve soil
   quality and the growth of high value horticultural crops.}},

Abstract = {{The successful release of wild type and genetically modified
   micro-organisms into soil has been impeded because efficacy is
   unpredictable. Evidence is presented showing that the plant-inoculum
   interaction can be strongly influenced by cropping system management or
   soil type. Rhizobacteria that inhibited the root growth of Poa annua and
   Lolium perenne were isolated from soil. The isolates, an inhibitory
   isolate (W7(+)) and a noninhibitory mutant (G2Y(-)), were identified as
   Pseudomonas putida. The rhizobacteria were used as soil inocula in a
   completely randomized block design that included Poa and Lolium, four
   soils, and three inoculum carriers. Of the possible 15 interactions, 10
   significantly affected both the root and shoot growth. These results
   suggest that field trials conducted without consideration of soil
   quality factors and carrier delivery systems will be of dubious value
   when evaluating the performance of allochthonous micro-organisms in

Abstract = {{The INTEX-Projekt is an interdisciplinary approach to combine
   agricultural research and farming system development. At two
   experimental sites totally 62 ha are cropped. in focus are two of the
   current farming systems: a) conventional fanning, according to,,Good
   Farming Practice{''} (three course rotation, inversion tillage): b)
   integrated farming (four course rotation, flexible inversion or
   non-inversion tillage). Field size and crop management are according to
   practical demands. All crops of the relation are established in every
   year. Starting in 1989, presently at least two cycles of the rotations
   are completed Details for winter wheat and oilseed rape are given.
   Average yield of winter wheat in the integrated farming system was 14 \%
   lower than in the conventional system. Hardly any difference occured in
   the yield of oilseed rape between the two systems at a site of good
   arable conditions, while at a hilly site with disadvantages in soil
   quality 25 \% yield reduction was observed. In yield variability of both
   wheat and oilseed rape hardly any difference occured between the two
   fanning systems. Time series for the eight years showed a smooth and
   significant increase of yield in (Integrated winter wheat production
   during the experimental period up to the level of Good Farming Practice,
   while yields, grown in the latter system varied around a constant line.
   Galium aparine, a weed occuring at the higher productive site, is taken
   as an example to demonstrate the population dynamics of dicotyledoneous
   weeds in the farming systems. Conversion to Integrated Farming was
   followed by a steep increase of G. aparine density in the first three
   years. Weed densities declined again with course of time. In the 8-year
   period actual populations of G. aparine both in integrated Farming and
   Good Farming Practice increased with equal rates, despite of
   preferential use of non-chemical weed control methods in the Integrated
   system At the hilly site, due to high densities of Alopecurus
   myosuroides no reductions in herbicide use were achieved.}},

Title = {{Valuing soil conservation benefits of agroforestry: contour hedgerows in
   the Eastern Visayas, Philippines}},

Abstract = {{Trees can be considered as investments made by economic agents to
   prevent depreciation of natural assets such as stocks of top soil and
   water. In agroforestry systems farmers use trees in this manner by
   deliberately combining them with agricultural crops on the same unit of
   land. Although advocates of agroforestry have asserted that soil
   conservation is one of its primary benefits, empirical estimates of
   these benefits have been lacking due to temporal and spatial complexity
   of agroforestry systems and the nonmarket aspect of soil capital assets.
   This study designs and applies a bio-economic framework for valuing the
   soil conservation benefits of agroforestry. The framework is tested with
   econometric analysis of data from surveys of households in Eastern
   Visayas, Philippines, where USAID/Government of Philippines introduced
   contour hedgerow agroforestry in 1983. By constructing a weighted soil
   quality index that also incorporates measures of soil fertility, texture
   and color in addition to erosion, we extend previous economic studies of
   soil resources. This index is regressed on a variety of farming and site
   specific bio-physical variables. Next, we use a Cobb-Douglas profit
   function to directly relate agricultural profits and soil quality. Thus,
   the value of soil conservation is measured as a quasi-rent differential
   or the share of producer surplus associated with a change in soil
   quality. Because this framework assumes the existence of markets, the
   assumption is tested by analysing the statistical significance of
   consumption side variables, e.,a., number of household members, on
   production side variables, e.g., profits. Instrumental variables are
   used to handle the endogeneity of the soil index in the profit equation.
   Seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) analysis is used to accommodate
   correlation of errors across the soil and profit equations. Regression
   results reveal the importance of agroforestry intensity, private
   ownership, land fragmentation, and familiarity with soil conservation as
   positive covariates of soil quality. Analysis of production data
   indicate the importance of market prices, education, farming experience,
   farm size, topography, and soil quality as positive covariates of
   household profits. Investments in agroforestry to improve or maintain
   soil capital can increased annual agricultural profits by US\$53 for the
   typical household, which is 6\% of total income. However, there are
   significant up-front costs. Given that small farmers in tropical uplands
   are important players in the management of deteriorating soil and forest
   resources, policy makers may want to consider supporting farmers in the
   early years of agroforestry adoption. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Complex (multi-species) agroecosystems change rapidly as a result of
   farmers' decisions based on their perception of opportunities and
   constraints. Overall, the major trend is still one of reducing
   complexity, This review addresses the driving forces as well as
   consequences of this change and discusses the hypothesis that complex
   agricultural systems are more dependable in production and more
   sustainable in terms of resource conservation than simple ones. Farmer
   decisions regarding planned diversity on the farm have consequences not
   only for the harvested produce, but also for associated diversity and
   non-harvested components which may contribute to ecological
   sustainability. Functional attributes of plants which can lead to
   complementarity in resource capture include root architecture and
   phenology, Three hypotheses on biodiversity and ecosystem function are
   formulated (ranging from weak negative to strong positive interactions)
   and discussed. Evidence is not yet conclusive. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A multispecies riparian buffer strip (MRB) was established along Bear
   Creek in central Iowa by the Agroecology Issues Team at Iowa State
   University (ISU) in order to assess the ability of the MRB to positively
   impact soil erosion and process non-point source pollutants to improve
   water quality. Soil organic matter (SOM), and especially
   biologically-active soil organic matter, is considered to be an
   important soil quality indicator variable because of it has relationship
   to critical soil functions like erodibility and the capacity of the soil
   to act as an environmental buffer. The objectives of this study were to
   examine trends in SOM C accrual and to quantify intra-seasonal changes
   in SOM C and particulate organic matter (POM) C for each vegetation zone
   of a MRBS seven years after establishment on previously cultivated or
   heavily grazed soil. Total SOM C and POM C in soil under perennial
   vegetation (poplar, switchgrass and cool season grass) were
   significantly higher than under cropped soil. Total POM C changed within
   vegetation type over the four month study period, whereas total SOM C
   did not. After six growing seasons, SOM C increased 8.5\% under poplar
   grown in association with cool season grass, and 8.6\% under
   switchgrass. The results are very promising and suggest that changes in
   SOM C can occur in a relatively short time after the establishment of
   perennial vegetation in a MRB. These changes should increase the ability
   of MRB soil to process non-point source pollutants.}},

Abstract = {{Soil microbial biomass comprises less than 5\% of organic matter in
   soil. However, it performs at least 3 critical functions in soil and the
   environment. It is a labile source df carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and
   sulfur; it is an immediate sink of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and
   sulfur; and it is an agent of nutrient transformation and pesticide
   degradation. In addition, microorganisms form symbiotic associations
   with roots, act as biological agents against plant pathogens, contribute
   towards soil aggregation, and participate in soil formation.
   Critical evaluation of the significance of soil microbial biomass is
   hampered by the reliable measurement of microbial biomass, and
   simultaneous partitioning of its 3 major functions in soil. For
   comparative purposes, soil microbial biomass and its derived indices
   have been successfully used to measure early changes induced by land use
   practices, zero tillage, crop rotations and other cultural practices,
   nutrient cycling, land disposal of sewage sludge, and applications of
   herbicides and insecticides. However, as a routine analytical tool, it
   is limited by the cumbersome and time consuming measurements, lack of
   benchmarking values and interpretation, ambiguous relationship with
   productivity, and cost-effectiveness.
   With increasing demand to monitor soil quality and protection of the
   environment, improved and rapid techniques, including molecular
   biotechniques, will be required to measure soil microbial biomass for
   its size of sink, source and rates of turnover. Eventually, agricultural
   science will benefit and utilise soil microbial biomass as an analytical
   tool to produce abundant, economical, and clean food and fibre.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced crop growth rates ('long-fallow disorder') can be a feature of
   long-fallow; cotton (cotton, alternating with a bare fallow, is sown
   every other year). This is usually attributed to decreased development
   of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), although associated soil physical,
   chemical, and biological properties are very rarely reported. A study
   was conducted from 1993 to 1997 in a grey, self-mulching Vertosol in the
   central-west of New South Wales to characterise soil properties under
   long-fallow cotton with a view to identifying soil factors other than AM
   that could contribute to cotton growth rate reductions. Soil quality
   indicators monitored were compaction (bulk density and air-filled
   porosity), strength (cone resistance), plastic limit, exchangeable
   cations, nitrate-N, pH, organic C, development of AM, and incidence of
   cotton root diseases. In comparison with continuous cotton, long-fallow
   cotton had lower soil strength, and lower plastic limit. Exchangeable Ca
   and Mg Ir ere higher with continuous cotton only in 1994. Higher
   nitrate-N was also observed with long-fallow during the first fallow
   phase of the experiment. Long-fallow did not have any significant effect
   on soil organic carbon. However, a net decline in soil organic C and
   exchangeable Mg occurred with both treatments. During the cotton phase,
   subsoil nitrate-N and incidence of black root rot were lower with
   long-fallow cotton. Uptake of nitrogen by continuous cotton may have
   been reduced by greater severity of black root rot. Vegetative and
   reproductive growth, water extraction, and cotton lint yields in
   long-fallow cotton plots were higher than those in continuous cotton
   plots. AM development was similar with continuous cotton and long-fallow
   cotton. Compared with long-fallow cotton, the lower lint yield in
   continuous cotton was thought to be due to the interactive effects of
   declining nutrient availability, higher soil strength, and greater
   severity of black root rot causing decreases in nutrient and water
   uptake.}},

Abstract = {{Soil biological and biochemical properties are highly sensitive to
   environmental stress and thus can be used to assess quality. Any soil
   quality index should include several biological and biochemical
   variables so as to reflect better the complex processes affecting soil
   quality and to compensate for the wide variations occurring in
   individual properties. Many authors recommend the use of a native soil
   supporting climax vegetation that has undergone minimal anthropogenic
   disturbance as a high quality reference soil. In this study which
   examined three such native soils of Galicia (N.W. Spain) bearing
   Atlantic oak-wood as the climax vegetation, biological and biochemical
   properties were found to vary widely seasonally and with samplmg site
   and depth. These variations were closely correlated with the total
   carbon (C) and/or total nitrogen (N) contents of the soils. The
   following equation:
   Total N=(0.38x10(-3)) microbial biomass C
   +(1.4x10(-3)) mineralized N
   +(13.6x10(-3)) phosphomonoesterase
   +(8.9x10(-3)) beta-glucosidase+(1.6x10(-3)) urease
   explained 97\% of the variance in total N for the soils studied,
   suggesting that a balance exists between the organic matter content of a
   soil and its biological and biochemical properties. A simplified
   expression of the above equation may be useful as a biochemical quality
   index for soils.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. continues efforts to develop genetically superior
   short-rotation woody crops (hybrid poplar and willow) and herbaceous
   crops (switchgrass). These biomass crops can provide multiple
   environmental benefits as well as energy and fiber. This paper focuses
   on results of site-specific studies that are quantifying the
   environmental potential and ramifications of converting agricultural
   croplands to biomass crop production.
   At research-scales, no differences have been found in erosion and
   movement of nutrients from annual row crops, switchgrass, and tree crops
   with and without a cover crop in the initial year of establishment.
   Research- and watershed-scale studies on different soil types, in
   different regions, and to match tree species with specific site
   characteristics and management regimes will help determine whether
   research-scale results can be used to predict effects at larger scales
   and to identify best management practices to minimize environmental
   effects while maximizing yields.
   Studies in different regions of the U.S. are evaluating the habitat
   value of biomass crops compared to agricultural row crops, grasslands,
   or natural forests. Results to date from both research- and larger-scale
   plantings show that SRWCs support greater bird diversity than row crops,
   but less diversity than natural forests. Switchgrass plantings extended
   habitat for grasslands birds compared to row crops. Surveys on
   industrial tree crop plantings in the south-eastern U.S. are addressing
   the relationship between site characteristics (planting acreage,
   species, landscape context, and age of plantings) and breeding bird use.
   The environmental studies of water and soil quality and wildlife
   diversity are being used to identify management strategies for biomass
   crops to increase productivity while increasing agricultural
   sustainability. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Pages = {{317-324}},
Abstract = {{The environmental costs and benefits of producing bioenergy crops can be
   measured both in terms of the relative effects on soil, water and
   wildlife habitat quality of replacing alternate cropping systems with
   the designated bioenergy system, and in terms of the quality and amount
   of energy that is produced per unit of energy expended. While many forms
   of herbaceous and woody energy crops will likely contribute to future
   biofuels systems, The Department of Energy's Bioenegy Feedstock
   Development Program (BFDP), has chosen to focus its primary herbaceous
   crops research emphasis on a perennial grass species, switchgrass
   (Panicum virgatum). The choice of switchgrass as a model bioenergy
   species was based on its high yields, high nutrient use efficiency and
   wide geographic distribution. Another important consideration was its
   positive environmental attributes. The latter include its positive
   effects on soil quality and stability, its cover value for wildlife, and
   relatively low inputs of energy, water and agrochemicals required per
   unit of energy produced. A comparison of the energy budgets for corn,
   which is the primary current source of bioethanol, and switchgrass
   reveals that the efficiency of energy production for a perennial grass
   system can exceed that for an energy intensive annual row crop by as
   much as 15 times. In addition potential reductions in CO2 emissions,
   tied to the energetic efficiency of producing transportation fuels and
   replacing non-renewable petrochemical fuels with ethanol derived from
   grasses are very promising. Calculated carbon sequestration rates may
   exceed those of annual crops by as much as 20-30 times, due in part to
   carbon storage in the soil. These differences have major implications
   for both the rate and efficiency with which fossil energy sources can be
   replaced with cleaner burning biofuels. Current research is emphasizing
   quantification of changes in soil nutrients and soil organic matter to
   provide improved understanding of the long term changes in soil quality
   associated with annual removal of high yields of herbaceous energy
   crops. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter is an active component of agroecosystems. Rapid and
   precise measurement of organic carbon (C-org) is essential to monitor
   changes in organic matter and soil quality. A new semi-micro wet
   digestion method for the determination of Corg Was developed using rapid
   microwave energy applied at 500 J mL(-1) digestion mixture to enhance
   oxidation of C-org by K2Cr2O7 and cone. H2SO4. This proposed method and
   three existing methods of soil C determination were compared with the
   LECO dry combustion carbon analyzer. The r(2) value for the proposed
   microwave method regressed against LECO C was 0.9913. The recovery of
   C-org by the rapid microwave digestion method for spectrophotometric
   measurement was 91.7+/-1.2\% (conversion factor 1.09) of C measured by
   the LECO dry combustion method. Compared to the traditional
   Walkley-Black's method, the proposed spectrophotometric with microwave
   digestion method was rapid and more precise, used smaller reagent
   volumes, and produced less waste.}},

Abstract = {{Erosion changes soil properties, removes nutrients and alters crop
   yields. A knowledge of these impacts on soil productivity is needed for
   economic analyses of erosion and conservation. Based on a United Nations
   Food and Agriculture Organization experimental design to monitor these
   changes, results are reported from four research sites in southern
   Brazil on Ferralsols and Cambisols, enabling the construction of
   erosion-yield-time and nutrient loss relationships. Plot experiments ran
   for up to seven years of natural erosion, followed by one or two years
   of maize cropping. A remarkably consistent composite erosion-yield
   relationship in logarithmic form was found, showing a sharp yield
   decline with initial soil loss. Soil `resilience' was identified through
   erosion-time relationships, `sensitivity' through erosion-yield
   equations. As erosion progressed, losses of nutrients, especially of
   organic carbon and calcium, were significant. In situ changes in soil
   properties were far less marked. Together with measured yield reductions
   caused by cumulative erosion, these results enabled the modelling of
   changes in soil productivity over time with respect to both soil quality
   and impact on yields. A production `half-life' of between one and 39
   years according to soil type and level of erosion was also identified.}},

Abstract = {{Maize production in Argentina is obtained mostly under dryland
   conditions and grain yield is highly related to water availability
   around silking. Drought, and differences in soil quality caused by
   intensive land use, sometimes limit water availability for the crop.
   Field experiments were performed on silty clay loam soils in the
   temperate humid region of Argentina (32 degrees to 35 degrees S, 58
   degrees to 62 degrees W), to (i) validate a methodology to determine
   maize water stress (Crop water stress index, CWSI), (ii) describe the
   behavior of CWSI along the crop cycle of three maize hybrids growing in
   environments with different soil quality, and () establish the effect of
   Soil quality and hybrids on the relationship between CWSI and available
   soil water. The CWSI methodology was satisfactorily validated. Crop
   water stress increased along the growing season in all environments and
   hybrids. No interactions between soil quality and hybrid on CWSI were
   found. The effect of soil quality on CWSI did not present a single and
   clear trend. Differences between hybrids in CWSI were detected. A
   relationship between CWSI and available soil water was fitted for all
   hybrids and environments (r(2) = 0.52, n = 51, P < 0.001). The threshold
   below which crops presented symptoms of water stress was 60\% of
   available soil water. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality is one of the most important factors in sustaining the
   global biosphere and developing sustainable agricultural practices. It
   has been defined in several different ways in recent years from view
   points of bioproductivity, sustainability, environmental protection, and
   human and animal health. In this paper, soil quality refers to its
   capacity to meet the need of plant growth. Land use and management
   practices greatly impact the direction and degree of soil quality
   changes in time and space. Understanding the effects of land use and
   management practices on soil quality and its indicators has been
   identified as one of the most important goals for modern soil science.
   This paper presents a method for assessing and mapping soil quality
   changes in time and space in small watersheds. It was developed and used
   to evaluate the changes in soil quality after 11 years of reclamation at
   Qian-Yan-Zhou experimental station (QYZES), which is located in
   subtropical China. Changes in soil quality was assessed and analyzed for
   cropland, citrus orchards, pastureland, grassland, sparse weed land,
   artificial forests, natural forests, bare land and other land uses. The
   Qian-Yan-Zhou Soil Quality Information System (QYZSQIS) has been
   developed using ARC/INFO and FOXBASE software. Two concepts of Relative
   Soil Quality Index (RSQI) and its difference (Delta RSQI) are introduced
   and used in the evaluation and analyses. By combining the QYZSQIS with
   databases of soil properties for different time periods, the system
   provides an effective method for evaluating soil quality changes in time
   and space in small watersheds. The RSQI provides a standard for
   comparing regional soil quality and the Delta RSQI a standard for
   evaluating soil quality changes over time. After 11 years of
   reclamation, there was a decrease in the area of both low quality and
   high quality soils, while medium quality soils increased. In terms of
   land use systems, the soil quality in paddy fields, vegetable fields and
   citrus orchards was dominated by improvement, whereas fuel woods, sparse
   weed land, and bare land were mainly degraded. Annual grass played an
   important role in the conservation and improvement of soil quality in
   the area. Except for land uses and management practices, original soil
   quality level also plays a major role in soil quality changes. Soils
   with higher quality were degraded more rapidly, because they usually
   need more nutrient input to maintain their quality status than those
   with lower quality. These analyses show that it is of equal importance
   to improve soil quality in degraded locations and to sustain it in
   high-quality areas. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   leaching studies demonstrated that land application was feasible and
   provided guidance for implementation of relevant and practically
   designed field studies. Two field trials were established to evaluate
   the impact of single and multiple applications of sludges from different
   mills on agricultural crops and soil quality in 1992 and 1993 and are
   monitored to obtain long-term data relative to crop yields and soil
   quality. The sludge amended treatments have demonstrated yield increases
   from two-to-five-fold greater than control and that increased yields
   have been sustained for at least five growing seasons. Three experiments
   were established in the forest beginning in 1993. The first involved
   application and incorporation of four rates of two sludge types in a
   replicated experiment on a recently harvested cut-block. Height and
   diameter increases up to 2.5 fold for white spruce (Picea glauca) and
   lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) seedlings planted in the
   sludge amended plots compared to the control plots have been observed
   during the past five growing seasons. Another experiment involved
   application of three rates of sludge on frozen and non-frozen soil on
   haul roads, borrow areas, and wellsites to assess the efficacy of the
   sludge in reclaiming disturbed areas in the forest and returning forest
   productivity. The bulk density of the sludge amended haul road soils was
   reduced by 30\%, soil water holding capacity was increased by 25\% and
   lodgepole pine seedling growth increased three-fold over control
   treatments.}},

Abstract = {{The book entitled ``Soil and Water Quality: An Agenda for
   Agriculture{''} by the U.S, National Academy of Sciences caused people
   to ask whether soil quality assessments could be used to evaluate the
   impact of public policies such as the Conservation Reserve Program
   (CRP), However, differences in scale, perception of soil quality, and
   the inability to directly measure soil quality led to significant
   uncertainty among several potential users, A major challenge was
   determining how to evaluate and combine information from different
   indicators to make an overall soil quality assessment that is
   meaningful. Our objectives are to present a structured approach for
   interpreting soil quality indicator data and to introduce a conceptual
   framework that can be used to link the various scales of evaluation,
   including those needed for assessing effectiveness of public policies
   such as the CRP. The framework and its use are discussed and
   demonstrated using soil quality indicator data from published and
   unpublished studies, On-farm measurements suggest that biological
   indicators such as microbial biomass and respiration were affected most
   quickly and to the greatest extent when cultivated land was converted to
   grassland, Applying the conceptual framework to this data suggests that
   enrolling fragile lands into CRP had a positive soil quality effect, It
   also indicates that using no-till practices to return CRP land to
   row-crop production will preserve soil quality benefits of the CRP, but
   tilling to prepare a seedbed will destroy the benefits almost
   immediately.}},

Abstract = {{A grazing study was initiated in the foothills of southwestern Alberta
   on the rough fescue grasslands (Festuca campestris (Rydb.) in 1949
   comparing various grazing intensities. In 1992, soil samples were
   obtained from the Ah horizon of paddocks grazed at 1.2 (light), 2.4
   (heavy), and 4.8 (very heavy) animal unit month ha(-1) and from an
   ungrazed exclosure (control). The thickness of the Ah horizon of the
   control averaged 22 cm while that of the lightly, heavily and very
   heavily grazed paddocks averaged 18, 12, and 8 cm, respectively. Soil
   color changed from 10YR 2/1 (black) to 10YR 4/3 (dark brown to brown) in
   response to very heavy grazing. Grazing pressures decreased the
   mean-weight diameter of water-stable aggregates, total C and P,
   monosaccharide content and the galactose + mannose/xylose + arabinose
   ratio, while it increased bulk density, pH-CaCl2, and total N. The loss
   of P must be viewed with concern. Treatment effects on most soil
   parameters were most pronounced at the two heavier grazing pressures.
   Particularly, the heavy grazing pressure jeopardized the sustainability
   of the ecosystem by reducing fertility and water-holding capacity.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally believed that soil erosion is the greatest single factor
   causing loss of soil productivity, However, the exact nature of these
   losses in terms of the concentrations of nutrients removed in windblown
   sediment vs, the parent soil from whence the sediment originated has not
   been adequately quantified. Two field sites were established in southern
   Alberta (one in 1990, one in 1993) as validation sites for the Wind
   Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) model. As part of this project, move
   than 400 windblown sediment samples (dt heights of 10-100 cm above the
   soil surface) were collected from a total of 29 erosion events. Analysis
   of windblown sediment sampler presented an opportunity to compare the
   nutrient content of windblown sediment with that of the adjacent surface
   soil where it originated Additionally, the effects of natural wind
   erosion on crop productivity were monitored. At Site 1, total N in
   windblown sediment trapped at 25-cm height showed an average (13 events)
   enrichment ratio of 1.11, while organic C in windblown sediment showed
   an average enrichment ratio of only 1.02 compared with soil from the
   erodible surface. At Site 2, the average (4 events) total N enrichment
   ratio was 1.08 and the average organic C enrichment ratio was 1.05. The
   depositional area at Site 1 showed nutrient enrichment compared with the
   erodible surface. Changes in soil productivity due to natural erosion
   were reflected in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields in 1992,
   but not in canola (Brassica napus L.) yields in 1993. Spring wheat
   yields showed a linear decrease with increased severity of erosion. For
   every 1 m increase in the distance from non-erodible surface there was a
   decrease of 3.6 kg ha(-1) in grain yield. The results provide further
   evidence that every effort should be made by producers and government
   agencies to prevent erosion of the thin layer of surface soil that
   ensures the future sustainability of agriculture on the semiarid
   Canadian prairies.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION}},

Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{214-218}},
Abstract = {{The importance of cover crops as determinants of soil quality has long
   been recognized in agriculture, from their common use as green manure
   crops in the mid 1900s to the broader range of cover mop management
   strategies in cropping systems of the 1990s. The two principal elements
   regulating soil biological activity, and hence nutrient cycling, are
   carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). This regulatory effect is manifested
   primarily in resource quality, which is a term representing the chemical
   composition and physical characteristics of cotter crops. The primary
   chemical factors determining the kinetics of residue decomposition and
   nutrient release are the C:N ratio and concentrations of lignin and
   other structural carbohydrates in plant tissues. With respect to N
   availability, grasses and legumes may serve different roles in cover
   crop-based production systems. Certain grass cover crops, most notably
   rye, have demonstrated a superior ability to scavenge for residual soil
   inorganic N compared to legumes. In contrast, legume cotter mops such as
   crimson clover and hairy vetch have the ability to provide substantial
   amounts of biologically-fixed N to crops such as corn, cotton, and
   sorghum. However, improvements are needed in the synchrony of cover crop
   N release with principal mop demand for N to efficiently utilize this
   source of N. In this regard future avenues for research should include a
   greater emphasis on plant breeding efforts to enhance the multipurpose
   roles of grass and legume cover crept, innovative management strategies
   utilizing cotter crops, and the we of models to enhance our predictive
   capabilities of nutrient cycling efficiencies in cropping systems.}},

Abstract = {{Cover cropping impacts soil properties in many positive ways. These
   include higher total carbon, which usually contributes to increased
   cation exchange capacity and water-holding capacity. Enhanced soil
   physical and chemical properties result in a better environment for the
   activity of soil microorganisms. We conducted a study of biological
   properties in no-till corn plots receiving either 0 or 168 kg N ha(-1).
   Plots were planted in the fall each year with a hairy vetch (Vicia
   villosa Roth), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), or not cover crop.
   The vetch cover resulted in the highest organic C accumulations, and the
   addition of N to the wheat or no cover plots increased C relative to the
   no N treatments. Soil organic C was not different between the vetch with
   adn without N, but pH was significantly reduced by N fertilization.
   Hairy vetch had a greater effect on microbial numbers than did the wheat
   cover or no cover. The greatest bacterial numbers were observed in the
   vetch with no N treatment. Acid phosphatase, arylsulfatase,
   beta-glucosidase and L-asparaginase activities were all higher in the
   vetch with no N treatment than any of the other combinations. In the
   wheat and no cover treatments, the enzyme activities mentioned earlier
   were all higher in the 168 kg N treatments. Soil treatments that
   increased soil organic C enhanced the activity of soil microorganisms
   and/or provided a better environment for the stabilization of
   microbially produced soil enzymes. Our data indicated that the use of
   cover crops significantly enhanced soil biological properties as
   measured by microbial numbers and enzyme activities. The use of cover
   crops provides soil quality benefits in addition to the reduction in
   soil loss attained with these systems.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining environmental quality implies sustainable agricultural
   production systems that preserve and protect soil resources. Cover crops
   play a dual role maintaining resource quality by providing ground cover
   to prevent wind and water erosion and carbon input to enhance soil
   quality. Carbon input from cover crops and crop stover play a vital role
   in agroecosystems for insuring long-term economic benefits with minimal
   impact on soil, water and air quality. The fresh carbon from cover crops
   is critical because of the role of the soil organic carbon cycle in
   controlling water, temperature, aeration, and soil structure. Both
   aboveground and root biomass are important to chemical and biological
   properties for the role in nutrient cycling. The benefits of available
   nitrogen from symbiotic fixation makes legume cover crops an
   environmental and economic preference. Use of selected cover crops and
   associated allelopathic effects can reduce chemicals required for weed
   control. While there are positive and negative aspects of cover crops
   from the economic viewpoint, when environmental costs are properly
   credited, cover crops surface as a major contribution to soil and
   environmental quality. The challenge is to assure cost-effective
   production using cover crops to maintain a healthy environment, a
   healthy economy, and a high quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{Conserving natural resources, especially soil and water are national
   goals in Austria. Soil and water quality are inherently linked,
   therefore enhancing or improving soil quality is a fundamental step
   towards enhancing or improving water quality. Vineyards near Vienna,
   Austria, are located on steep (35\%) slopes, and soil loss is a major
   problem. Tillage practices have been designed to reduce soil erosion. We
   evaluated these tillage practices in terms of each treatment
   effectiveness in reducing soil erosion from vineyards. Different amounts
   of soil cover by manures or clover were investigated, including a bare
   soil treatment. The impact of each tillage practice on physical chemical
   and I; biological soil properties and crop (grape) productivity were
   also investigated Each tillage practice had been established for eight
   years. Compared to bare soil treatment manure and clover cover had a
   positive impact on soil quality. Also, amount and quality of grapes were
   greatly enhanced compared to bare soil treatment. At another field site,
   eight cover crops were evaluated with regard to soil cover, cover crop
   yield, and water use and redistribution. Significant differences were
   observed between water use and redistribution among cover crop
   treatments. A cover crop mixture of Lolium perenne, Festuca arundinacea
   and Trifolium repens developed high soil cover with low crop water
   requirement.}},

Pages = {{5-20}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the effects of long-term
   (1950s to 1992) cropping by farmers, using their own cultural and
   fertilization practices, on soil quality as measured by soil OC, total
   N, NaHCO3-extractable P, and pH. We sampled farmers fields at 27
   Oklahoma sites (representing six soil associations) in the 1950s and
   again in 1992. We also sampled soil at 2 sites with native sod to
   determine changes in soil properties since initial cultivation. Most of
   the sites were in areas commonly cropped to continuous wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L.). One of the 27 sites was planted to tall fescue (Festuca
   arundinacea Schreb), in the late 1970s. On the 26 cropped sites, OC and
   total N levels did not change significantly during the time period.
   Sodium bicarbonate extractable P increased significantly on 2 soil
   associations but remained unchanged on the other associations. Soil pH
   decreased on 2 associations and remained unchanged on the others. These
   results indicate that, except for reducing pH on some soils, farmers are
   growing continuous wheat without degrading these measures of soil
   quality.
   In the study of changes since initial cultivation, virgin Grant silt
   loam lost 45\% of its surface (0-13 cm) OC in 25 yr and 59\% in 92 yr of
   cultivation. Respective losses in total N were 23 and 46\%. Kirkland
   silt loam surface (0-15 cm) soil had lost 42 and 47\% of its initial OC
   after 58 and 92 yr in cultivation. Respective losses of total N were 29
   and 36\%. After cropping, both OC and total N levels in surface soils
   were similar to those in the subsoils. This was also true on the 26
   cropped soils.
   At the site converted to grassland, OC and total N increased sharply,
   extractable P was unchanged, and pH was increased, probably as a result
   of lime application. Results obtained on this site may be indicative of
   changes occurring on land in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality and resilience characteristics determine productivity,
   sustainability, and risks of soil and environmental degradation. Soil
   surface management, comprising residue mulch and tillage methods,
   affects soil quality and resilience. Field experiments were conducted in
   western Nigeria on soils prone to erosion and degradation to evaluate
   the effects of mulch rates on runoff, soil erosion and crop yield.
   Effects of five mulch rates (4, 3, 2, 1 and 0 Mg/ha/season of rice straw
   mulch) with notill on crop response were compared with that of plow till
   treatment on field runoff plots for four consecutive years from 1981 to
   1984. Runoff and soil erosion effects of different mulch rates were
   measured for only 1981 and 1984. Maize grain yield was significantly
   affected by mulching in 1 out of 3 seasons, and was the highest at 5.4
   Mg/ha for 4 Mg/ha mulch rate and the lowest at 3.5 Mg/ha for 1 Mg/ha
   mulch rate, a difference of 54\%. Soybean grain yield was significantly
   higher at 1.4 Mg/ha for 4 Mg/ha mulch rate than 0.8 Mg/ha for 1 Mg/ha
   mulch rate, a difference of 62.5\%. Mean cowpea yield was the highest at
   about 1 Mg/ha for 4 Mg/ha mulch rate and the lowest at 0.7 Mg/ha for
   unmulched plots. Runoff and soil erosion were lower in 1981 than in
   1984, with higher losses generally for the plow till treatment. The
   index of relative mean annual soil erosion was in the order 100 (plow
   till), 35.1 (0 Mg/ha mulch rate), 25.0 (1 Mg/ha mulch rate), 30.9 (2
   Mg/ha mulch rate), 20.8 (3 Mg/ha mulch rate), and 16.1 (4 Mg/ha mulch
   rate). Reductions in soil erosion by mulching were due both to decreased
   runoff and to lower sediment concentration in runoff. The data show that
   the desirable mulch rate for soil and water conservation is about 4
   Mg/ha/season for these soils.}},

Abstract = {{Low residue-producing crops such as cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.),
   especially when grown in monoculture, are detrimental to soil quality.
   Cover crops, crop rotations with legumes and high-residue crops can
   improve soil quality. The `Old Rotation' (1896) is the oldest continuous
   cotton experiment in the world and includes rotations and winter legume
   cover crops in cotton production systems. There are six treatments in
   the `Old Rotation': a three-year rotation of cotton and grain crops plus
   a winter legume cover crop; two fertilizer treatments (with and without
   N fertilizer) imposed on a two-year rotation of cotton and a grain crop
   plus a winter legume cover crop; and three continuous cotton cropping
   systems (with N fertilizer, without N or N supplied from a winter legume
   cover crop). Because of the uniqueness of `Old Rotation' and the current
   interest in soil quality, the specific objectives of this study were: 1)
   to determine the effects of rotations on soil qualify after 100 years;
   2) to evaluate the USDA Soil Quality Kit and compare results with
   standard procedures for selected indicators; and 3) to develop a
   baseline of soil quality indicators to monitor change. After 100 years,
   soil quality was better for the three-year rotation and the two-year
   rotation plus N due to higher soil C (1.3 and 1.1\%, respectively,
   compared to a mean of 0.8\% for others). The three-year rotation had
   higher percentage water stable aggregates (64\% compared to a range of
   34 to 53\% for other treatments). Cation exchange capacity was highest
   for the three-year rotation and the two-year rotation (5.5 and 5.4
   cmol(c)/kg, respectively, compared to a mean of 4.4 cmol(c)/kg for other
   treatments). Soil strength was lowest (six bars) for the three-year
   rotation while continuous cotton without a cover crop or N had the
   highest soil strength in the top 4 in. of the plow layer. Kit
   measurements had higher variability relative to standard procedures.
   Soil moisture was greater at the time Kit measurements were taken and
   fewer samples were used, which may explain increased variability. The
   Kit can be used to evaluate trends and comparisons but should not be
   used in place of standard procedures for research. Information from this
   study will set a baseline for soil quality indicators for the `Old
   Rotation', and future studies will measure the differences in soil
   quality as a result of the conversion to conservation tillage in 1997.}},

   erosion is ca. (5-7) x 10(9) t year(-1). The eroded area may be
   classified into 5 regions according to the soil characters. Each region
   has its own features of erosion and temporal variability. Soil erosion
   has brought about serious consequences: loss of farmland, degeneration
   of soil quality, aggradation of rivers, reservoirs and lakes, hazard for
   navigation: deterioration of urban environment etc. Extensive works for
   soil and water conservation have been conducted in China with great
   success. The main approaches for control of soil erosion include
   technical measures, social and nonstructural measures, and comprehensive

Abstract = {{Soils perform five functions (biochemical and geochemical cycling,
   partitioning of water, storage and release, buffering, energy
   partitioning) that are essential for the support of ecosystems. When
   shifting from natural/semi-natural systems to managed systems, the
   balance among these functions can be extensively changed. This is
   especially true in the case of agroecosystems. Food supply is one of the
   most important questions in the domain of interactions between humans
   and their environment. Land available to agriculture is limited for
   topographical and climatic reasons, and half of that land is under
   production. Increasing food production to meet the future needs of the
   world's growing population will require management practices that make
   optimal use of available land and water resources, while maintaining the
   balance among the soil functions. A large imbalance results in land
   degradation. Increasing productivity on the best arable lands will
   require additional research towards establishing the tolerable intensity
   of soil use for sustainable agriculture. A better understanding of soil
   ecology will help in developing more environmentally-friendly
   sustainable farming systems.}},

   from neighbouring arid areas. Ecophysiological records and botanical

Abstract = {{In the arid and semi-arid areas of Morocco, irrigation is necessary to
   obtain good and sustainable agricultural production. In the last 10
   years, pivot irrigation, along with other irrigation techniques, has
   been introduced in arid regions on range lands where an uncertain
   rainfed agriculture is practiced. The objectives of this study were i)
   to evaluate changes of selected soil characteristics caused by pivot
   irrigation in the Bahira region of central Morocco and ii) relate the
   rates of soil change to water quality.
   Forty-nine pivot plots were selected ranging in size from 25 to 50 ha,
   and irrigated from 1 to 10 years. Both irrigated and control
   (non-irrigated) plots were sampled for determining the major soil
   characteristics. Irrigation water quality was also determined for each
   plot.
   Irrigation caused a significant positive effect bn the annual variation
   rate of EC, ESP, exchangeable sodium and magnesium, and permeability.
   The effect of irrigation was not significant on other soil
   characteristics (pH, organic matter, calcium carbonate equivalent,
   cation. exchange capacity, and exchangeable calcium). Even with good
   water quality and good soil permeability, irrigation caused rapid
   salinization and alkalinization of the soils under high
   evapotranspiration. For pivot center units having the same soil type,
   salinization increased as a function of increased irrigation water
   salinity and the number of years under irrigation. Sodification of the
   soil increased with the increase of irrigation water SAR in only clayey
   soils. No relationship was found between ESP and permeability.
   The number of years necessary to reach critical EC values for cereal
   crops is variable from one pivot unit to another. Desalinization
   measures should be undertaken to prevent building up of salts in the
   soils.}},

Abstract = {{The Better Land Husbandry (BLH) philosophy suggests that soil
   conservation is best served by promoting local land management
   strategies that benefit both the land user and the soil. BLH strategies
   work with the soil's regenerative capacities to improve the vitality of
   the total soil ecosystem. BLH emphasises creating favourable soil
   structure and managing soil organic matter rather than merely preventing
   physical soil loss. This paper offers a case study of a BLH approach to
   the regeneration of opencast coal-lands in Wales. Here, many officially
   `reclaimed' lands are in poor condition. Attempts to reclaim this land
   by masking the spoil with a thin layer of alien topsoil have not proved
   universally successful. Trafficking and the natural accelerated
   weathering of minestones have raised soil densities to levels which
   inhibit plant growth and foster accelerated runoff. A different approach
   involving soil self-creation is being developed. Countering soil
   compaction may be the key. While grassed spoils have a lower density and
   a greater capacity to absorb runoff than unvegetated, the effect is too
   superficial. At Blaenavon, flood peaks on reclaimed grasslands remain
   more than twice those on adjacent moorland. However, trees affect soil
   density, hydrological processes and erosion rates more dramatically than
   grass. Thus, long term forest fallowing may prove the best route to the
   regeneration of self-sustaining soils. In Wales, the problem remains to
   demonstrate to local communities that forestation is a valid option for
   the restoration of waste lands.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality standards designed to focus land reclamation agencies on
   potential problems, supported by sustained post-project inspection and
   enforcement, may be the best route to securing the long term
   productivity of reclaimed lands. This paper opens discussion on the
   determination of appropriate measures of soil quality by discussing two
   aspects: soil architecture and soil pH. It suggests that `successfully
   reclaimed' land should have soil bulk densities not exceeding 1.6
   g/cm(3) within 50 cm, and 1.8 g/cm(3), within 100 cm of the surface and
   a soil pH not exceeding the bounds pH (3.0) 3.5 - 8.5 (9.0) within 150
   cm of the soil surface. Since, many problems associated with soil
   decline develop slowly, these conditions should obtain in tests
   conducted at reclamation, and 10 and 20 years subsequently. It is
   emphasised that the environmental standards proposed are arbitrary and
   that the inter-relationships between bulk density, soil acidity and
   other aspects of the soil system are complex.}},

Abstract = {{The key problem of tropical agriculture is the steady decline in soil
   fertility, which is closely correlated to duration of soil use. This is
   due primarily to soil erosion and the loss of organic matter associated
   with conventional tillage practices, that leave the soil base and
   unprotected in times of heavy rainfall and heat. The implications of
   soil preparation on soil erosion and the sustainability of agricultural
   production was studied with special reference to experience and projects
   carried out in Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina under tropical and
   subtropical conditions.
   Scientific data show that under tropical and subtropical conditions,
   tillage generally has a detrimental effect on chemical, physical and
   biological soil properties. Investigations also show that erosion damage
   is enhanced when the soil is bare. Water infiltration rates are
   increased and consequently erosion is reduced when mulch covers the soil
   in a no-tillage system. Tillage also. releases considerable amounts of
   CO2 into the atmosphere contributing to global warming. In order, to
   achieve sustainable agriculture in the tropics and avoid global warming,
   soil tillage has to be reduced to a minimum or avoided completely and
   the soil has to stay as long as possible covered with mulches, sod and
   growing crops. No-tillage in mulches of previous crops or green manures
   in combination with adequate crop rotations is the production system of
   the future if sustainable agriculture is to be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{What are the benefits of agricultural research in relation to existing
   knowledge and the need to implement already known practical and
   political measures to stimulate agricultural production? During the
   Green Revolution investments in agricultural research at both national
   and international levels resulted in significant increase of the
   agricultural productivity in several developing countries especially in
   Asia. This positive response depended primarily upon the development of
   hybrids, the relatively homogeneous environment with regard to soils,
   climate and cropping systems, the access to irrigation and not least
   upon a development oriented state with an efficient extension service.
   These preconditions are unusual in Africa. A growing population demands
   more food but the possibilities to raise production are limited not only
   by poor governance but also by climatic factors which together with soil
   quality define the agro-ecological zones. Further, little new land is
   available in many countries, where increased production entails
   increased productivity. The need for a sustainable solution to this
   problem is a major argument for the necessity of agricultural research.
   The implementation of research will depend on the research climate
   within the countries and at the international institutes. National
   research networks are often weak and the international agricultural
   research centres have had difficulties in getting their new technologies
   adopted. Current attempts to improve the situation are being made by the
   Special Program for African Agricultural Research, SPAAR, and the World
   Bank. Where should the efforts be made? In areas of high agricultural
   potential, where fast results may be possible. Or in areas of unreliable
   rainfall and poor soils, where the need is to maintain a diversified
   system and to spread risks rather than raising the yield of a particular
   crop. There is a call for a double green revolution, i.e, production
   increase in an environmentally sound way, with new paradigms of
   biotechnology and research in complex systems. Will this research
   contribute to sustainability, will it be cost-efficient and possible to
   implement?}},

Abstract = {{Conservation tillage has become an attractive form of agricultural
   management practices for corn and soybean production on heavy textured
   soil in southern Ontario because of the potential for improving soil
   quality. A controlled drainage system combined with conservation tillage
   practices has also been reported to improve water quality. In
   Southwestern Ontario, field scale an farm demonstration sites were
   established in a paired watershed (no-tillage vs. conventional tillage)
   on clay loam soil to study the effect of tillage system on soil
   structure and water quality. The sites included controlled drainage and
   free drainage systems to monitor their effect on nitrate loss in the
   tile drainage water.
   Soil structure, organic matter content and water storage in the soil
   profile were improved with no-tillage (NT) compared to conventional
   tillage (CT). No-tillage also increased earthworm populations.
   No-tillage was found to have higher tile drainage volume and nitrate
   loss which were attributed to an increase in soil macropores from
   earthworm activity. The controlled drainage system (CD) reduced nitrate
   loss in tile drainage water by 14\% on CT site and 25.5\% on NT site
   compared to the corresponding free drainage system (DR) from May, 1995
   to April 30, 1997. No-tillage farming practices are definitely enhanced
   by using a controlled drainage system for preventing excessive nitrate
   leaching through tile drainage. Average soybean yields for CT site were
   about 12 to 14\% greater than the NT site in 1995 and 1996. However,
   drainage systems had very little effect on soybean yields in 1995 and
   1996 due to extremely dry growing seasons. (C) 1998 Published by

Abstract = {{This study examines the effect of sewage sludge application on
   biological and biochemical properties of soil in the plots maintained by
   the City of Winnipeg at Oak Hammock Marsh, Manitoba. Soils were
   collected from plots receiving single and multiple applications of 0, 50
   and 100 tonnes of sludge ha(-1). Sludge application significantly (P <
   0.05) increased the amount of microbial biomass present in the soils.
   The biomass N content was uncharacteristically low resulting in a mean
   microbial biomass C:N ratio of 36:1. Despite the low C:N ratio of the
   biomass, sludge application enhanced the N mineralization potential of
   the soil. Potential activities of three soil enzymes (arylsulfatase,
   acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase) were also monitored in this
   study. Sludge application somewhat increased soil enzyme activities. In
   addition, a significant (P < 0.05) temporal variation in potential
   activities was also observed in this study. The functional diversity of
   the soil community was assessed using Biolog(TM) microplates. The
   highest rate of sludge application (2 x 100 t ha(-1)) was found to
   significantly (P < 0.04) reduce the functional diversity of the soil
   community. These results suggest that although the sludge application
   resulted in a reduction in the diversity of the microbial population,
   the overall size of the soil microbial biomass and its nutrient
   mineralization potential were either unchanged or increased. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Understanding the spatial distribution pattern of soil properties is
   important to determine soil constraints to plant nutrition and
   appropriate management of soil resources in recently cultivated areas.
   This study addresses spatial variability of exchangeable potassium (K-e)
   and sum of bases (S-B) in Mato Grosso State, Brazil. Geostatistical
   methods described the spatial variability and predicted along four
   transects crossing different soil mapping units and land use types.
   Ordinary kriging appropriately estimates values in unsampled areas. It
   identifies places where more intensive sampling is required. This study
   shows that land use affected spatial variability of K-e and S-B in
   well-defined structural patterns. In particular, K-e exhibits a strong
   spatial dependence and anisotropy in two horizons. Traditional surveys
   of soil fertility, together with data from soil survey maps, can be used
   in combination with geostatistics by decision-makers to support
   management planning and to predict indicators related to soil quality as
   a measure of sustainability. As it turns out, K-e and S-B need to be
   sampled at different densities, and soil survey information can be used
   to advantage to reduce the sampling efforts of S-B by 96\%. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{A regression study among environmental quality objectives on soil,
   marine and fresh water is studied, considering toxicity data on
   ecological representative species of invertebrates. The study was
   carried out by comparing VIE-C values, as defined by E. Angulo and A,
   Urzelai (1994, in Plan Director para la Proteccion del Suelo. Calidad
   del Suelo, Valores Indicativos de Evaluacion, pp, 121-184. IHOBE,
   Bilbao), To derive these VIE-C values, no-observed-effect concentrations
   from chronic single-species assays that consider relevant parameters in
   population dynamics are used, The calculations follow the method of N,
   M, van Straalen and C, A, J, Denneman (1989, Ecotoxicol. Environ. Saf.
   18, 241-251), Equations relating long-term toxicity data of fresh/marine
   waters, soil/marine water, and soil/fresh water for five metals (Cd, Cu,
   Hg, Pb, and Zn) are calculated, indicating good correlation between
   environments: 0.85, 0.78, and 0.89, respectively, On the basis of these
   results this approach may be useful to obtain soil quality criteria
   values from other environmental compartments, when soil data are not
   available. (C) 1997 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Soil compaction is a concern worldwide, particularly where compactible
   soils are used for intensive agriculture in a wet climate. We have
   investigated the impact of compaction and the associated changes in soil
   structural qualities on crop production and environmental pollution. The
   overall objective was to develop soil management systems that provide
   suitable conditions for crop growth and minimize environmental damage.
   We ran large-scale field experiments studying the preservation of
   structural quality in arable and permanent grassland, using management
   systems such as the control or elimination of field traffic and the
   application of conservation tillage and zero tillage. We measured bulk
   density, shear strength, cone resistance, macroporosity, relative
   diffusivity, air permeability and water infiltrability to identify soil
   qualities that could be used for selecting suitable soil management.
   Along with crop yield, we measured environmental impacts, such as the
   emissions of nitrous oxide from the soil, which require the interaction
   of soil structure and water content near the soil surface. Soil
   structure influenced wetness, which affected trafficability, compaction
   and nitrogen retention. Measurement of properties that affect fluid
   storage and transport, such as macroporosity, provided soil quality
   indices that helped in recommending suitable soil management systems.
   Spatial variation of structure associated with wheel-track locations
   could be estimated rapidly using a cone penetrometer. Variation was
   particularly important in determining crop yield consistency. Crop
   productivity and soil structural qualities were preserved best when
   field traffic was eliminated. A reduced ground-pressure system
   successfully minimized compaction in grassland but was less effective in
   an arable rotation. Unless traffic is eliminated, good timing of
   operations is the most effective way to preserve soil structural
   quality.}},

   This article considers the choice of irrigation systems conditional on

   low-pressure irrigation technologies are estimated for citrus and
   vineyard crops using a held-level data set from California's Central
   Valley. Results show that the influence of land quality and water price
   on low-pressure technology adoption is greater for citrus than for

Abstract = {{The study reports on the impact of inorganic fertilisers with or without
   farmyard manure on the cation exchange capacity (CEC), cationic balance
   and microbial biomass carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in a
   savanna Alfisol after 45 years of cultivation. Soils for the study were
   fertilised with N or N + P + K, cow dung (D), D + N and D + N + P + K
   for 45 years. Inorganic fertiliser significantly reduced CEC,
   exchangeable cations and upset the cationic balance. The reduction in
   CEC and exchangeable cations seemed to operate via organic matter
   depletion and pH reduction. Similarly inorganic fertiliser stressed
   microbial activity evidenced by the low amounts of microbial biomass C,
   N and P compared to the soil under native vegetation and the soils
   fertilised with D + N and D + N + P + K. From the perspective of the
   flows of C, N and P through soil microbial biomass, and cation exchange
   properties and prevention of nutritional imbalances involving basic
   cations, a rational fertilisation program for savanna Alfisols is one
   that combines inorganic fertilisers with farmyard manures.}},

Journal = {{SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4, S}},
Pages = {{230-244}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural soils, having been depicted of much of their native carbon
   stocks, have a significant CO2 sink capacity. Global estimates of this
   sink capacity are in the order of 20-30 Pg C over the next 50-100 years.
   Management practices to build hip soil C must increase the input of
   organic matter to soil and/or decrease soil organic matter decomposition
   rates. The most appropriate management practices to increase soil C vary
   regionally, dependent on both environmental and socioeconomic factors.
   In temperate regions, key strategies involve increasing cropping
   frequency and reducing bare fallow, increasing the use of perennial
   forages (including N-fixing species) in crop rotations, retaining crop
   residues and reducing or eliminating tillage (i.e. no-till). In North
   America and Europe, conversion of marginal arable land to permanent
   perennial vegetation, to protect fragile soils and landscapes and/or
   reduce agricultural surpluses, provides additional opportunities for C
   sequestration.
   In the tropics, increasing C inputs to soil through improving the
   fertility and productivity of cropland and pastures is essential. In
   exclusive systems with vegetated fallow periods (e.g. shifting
   cultivation), planted fallows and cover crops can increase C levels over
   the cropping cycle. Use of no-till, green manures and agroforestry are
   other beneficial practices. Overall, improving the productivity and
   sustainability of existing agricultural lands is crucial to help reduce
   the rate of new land clearing, from which large amounts of CO2 from
   biomass and soil are emitted to the atmosphere,
   Some regional analyses of soil C sequestration and sequestration
   potential have been performed, mainly for temperate industrialized
   countries. More are needed, especially for the tropics, to capture
   region-specific interactions between climate, soil and management
   resources that are lost in global level assessments.
   By itself C sequestration in agricultural soils can make only modest
   contributions (e.g. 3-6\% of total fossil C emissions) to mitigating
   greenhouse gas emissions. However, effective mitigation policies will
   not be based on any single `magic bullet' solutions, but rather on many
   modest reductions which are economically efficient and which confer
   additional benefits to society. In this context, soil C sequestration is
   a significant mitigation option. Additional advantages of pursuing
   strategies to increase soil C are the added benefits of improved soil
   quality for improving agricultural productivity and sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{A monitoring programme for the concentrations of heavy metals in Danish
   arable soils and on nature areas was initiated in 1990 by the Danish
   EPA. The monitoring programme comprises 393 sampling points scattered in
   a regular grid over the country and in addition 20 sampling points on
   agricultural fields fertilised with sewage sludge. Samples taken from
   the top 25 cm of the soil at each sampling point have been analysed for
   the heavy metals Pb, Cd, Cu, Cr, Hg, Ni and Zn and for the metalloid As.
   The content of Ni, Zn and Cr and to some extent Cu and As, are well.
   correlated with soil texture. Differences are not found between soils
   with different land use, atmospheric deposition, etc. that renders it
   possible, that the soil content of heavy metals in general is determined
   by anthropogenic sources. It is, however, possible, that the
   concentrations at some points with high values of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Hg
   are affected by anthropogenic sources. The measured concentrations are
   comparable to what have been found in earlier Danish investigations and
   typically lower than levels found in neighbouring countries. It is
   concluded that the levels of heavy metals found in Danish arable soils
   and on nature areas in general do not give rise to concern. The levels
   are generally low compared to Danish soil quality criteria and the
   current load is modest compared to the content in the soil. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The total content of Ba, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V and Zn, determined by means
   of X-ray fluorescence was studied in soils of an agro-industrial area
   near Barcelona (NE Spain) in order to establish their background levels.
   A total of 363 samples were analysed, of which 268 belonged to 67
   slightly disturbed and representative soil profiles. The remainder were
   taken at the soil surface (0-5 cm) in a polluted area located near a
   composting plant. The background ranges were established with
   probability plots and the upper limits of the resulting ranges were
   compared with those reported in the literature. In order to study the
   statistical distribution of the trace elements in the soils of the area,
   the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of distribution fitting was applied. The
   upper limits of the established background ranges were: Ba, 1762 mg/kg;
   Cr, 275 mg/kg; Cu, 145 mg/kg; Ni, 83 mg/kg; Pb, 91 mg/kg; V, 183 mg/kg;
   and Zn, 326 mg/kg. It was concluded that probability plots seemed to be
   a reliable statistical method for establishing the background contents
   of these elements in the soils of the area studied. The trace elements
   investigated were distributed in these soils following the log-normal
   law. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Green manures (GM) may offset inorganic N needs and improve soil
   quality, Study objectives were to determine effects of green manure on
   soil-N fertility, water use, soil quality, and yield of spring wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.), On two treatments, lentil (Lens culinaris
   Medikus cv. Indianhead) was green manured in a green manure-spring wheat
   rotation. Lentil was killed by disking (GMMF) or chemicals (GMCF).
   Additional treatments were annually cropped wheat (AW) in a mechanical
   fallow (MF) or chemical fallow (CF) sequence. No inorganic N was used on
   GMMF and GMCF. Experiments were started in 1991 on a Williams loam
   (fine-loamy, mixed Typic Argiboroll) near Culbertson, MT. Green-manure
   treatments used 56 mm more water than fallow treatments when lentil was
   grown to lower-pod set. When lentil was killed at full bloom, there were
   no differences in water use among GM and fallow treatments, There were
   no differences among treatments in soil water at wheat planting, Wheat
   yield was 25\% less on GM than on MF and CF, Soil NO3-N (0-0.6 m) was
   35\% less on GM than MF and CF rotations. There were no differences in
   soil quality indicators of bulk density, organic C, pH, electrical
   conductivity, and deep NO3-N (0.6-1.8 m) among treatments after two
   cycles of GM, Potentially mineralizable N was 66\% greater on GM
   treatments than on fallow treatments, Short-term results (5 yr) show
   that available N limited wheat production more than did soil water on
   the GM treatments, Soil improvement using green manures may require many
   additional cropping cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Cropping systems can affect soil quality and productivity of subsequent
   crops. We conducted this study to evaluate effects of several annual and
   perennial crop species on N removal, residual soil N, aggregate
   stability, and subsequent corn (Zea mays L.) production. Thirteen
   cropping systems were grown with various rates of N fertilizer for 6 yr
   on a Typic Calciaquoll soil in central Iowa. Perennial plant species
   were then killed, corn was planted, and half of each plot was fertilized
   with 224 kg N ha(-1) and half was left unfertilized. Plant analyses
   showed that the perennial C-4 species, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.)
   and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman var. gerardii),
   consistently removed the least N. There was little difference for soil
   total N, NH4-N, or NO3-N concentrations to a depth of Im among reed
   canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), switchgrass, sweet sorghum
   {[}Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.).
   Residual NO3-N concentrations were higher to a depth of lm for subplots
   fertilized with 280 kg N ha(-1) for 6 yr than for plots fertilized with
   less N. Aggregate stability did not differ following reed canarygrass,
   switchgrass, sweet sorghum, or alfalfa. Without N during the 7th yr,
   corn following sweet sorghum produced the lowest yield (7.5 t ha(-1)),
   whereas the highest yield following a nonlegume crop was for corn after
   big bluestem (11.8 t ha(-1)). Corn without N following soybean
   {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yielded 11.1 t ha(-1), while that following
   alfalfa yielded 13.6 t ha(-1). Fertilizer N reduced the rotation effect,
   but increased profile N with both perennial and annual crops. Corn
   following reed canarygrass, big bluestem, alfalfa, soybean, and sorghum
   intercropped into alfalfa had significantly higher yields (14.1, 14.2,
   15.7, 14.2, and 15.3 t ha(-1), respectively) than corn following corn
   (13.0 t ha(-1)). Non N rotation effects (those remaining despite applied
   N) could not be explained by residual soil N or aggregate stability
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{An 11-yr study was conducted on a coarse-textured Brown Chernozemic soil
   in the semiarid prairie of southwestern Saskatchewan. Soil was sampled
   after 3, 7 and 11 yr, and the results were used to assess the influence
   of fallow frequency and tillage on selected soil quality attributes
   {[}e.g., total soil organic C and N, microbial biomass C (MB-C) and
   microbial biomass N (MB-N), C mineralization (C-min) and N
   mineralization (N-min), and specific respiratory activity (SRA)] in the
   0- to 7.5-cm and 7.5- to 15-cm depths. Although it took 11 yr before we
   observed significant treatment effects on total organic C or N, effects
   on C-min and N-min were observed in 7 yr in the 0- to 7.5-cm depth and
   by 11 yr, MB and SRA also showed significant treatment effects in this
   depth, Generally, soil quality attributes were greater in no-tillage
   (NT) systems than in conventional mechanical tillage (CT) or minimum
   tillage (MT), and greater in continuous wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
   (Cont W) than in fallow-wheat (F-W) systems. With time, the labile
   constituents tended to increase under the Cent W cropping, but to
   decrease when F-W was coupled with MT. After 11 yr there was a strong,
   direct association between the labile attributes (viz., C-min, N-min and
   MB-C) in the 0- to 7.5-cm depth and the mean annual straw produced (kg
   ha(-1)yr(-1)) in the four cropping systems tested. Of the soil quality
   attributes tested, C-min and N-min were the most sensitive indices to
   tillage and fallow frequency effects.}},

Abstract = {{In this study the impact of a rotation grazing system on the soil and
   vegetation of a Stipa-Bouteloua-Agropyron community in the mixed prairie
   ecoregion was compared with the ungrazed treat ment in exclosures. At a
   low stocking rate, grazing had no effect on the vegetation but did alter
   soil quality. Grazing pressure was so light in the rotational grazing
   treatment that recovery of productivity, as measured by standing crop
   and litter, was not significantly different from the ungrazed treatment.
   Conversely, the species distribution was unchanged but was indicative of
   a lower seral state for this mixed prairie. The effect of grazing on

Abstract = {{Conversion of improved pastures to Pinus radiata plantations is a
   significant land-use change and provides an opportunity to evaluate the
   effects of changes in chemical and biological soil parameters on soil
   organic matter dynamics. We assessed changes in soil microbial and
   microfaunal populations for a series of paired sites in the Manawatu
   region, New Zealand. The change in land-use to P. radiata was associated
   with declines in soil pH, microbial C and N, soil C and N, soil C : N
   ratio, microbial C : organic C ratio, total nematodes, most nematode
   functional groups, and nematode diversity in 0-10 cm mineral soil. These
   shifts reflect a decline in both the quantity and quality of organic
   matter input to mineral soil, with lower \% organic C contents and wider
   C : N ratio in soils under P. radiata. While these declines could be
   regarded as reductions in `soil quality', such changes involve shifts in
   soil properties originating from pasture rather than from the original,
   native vegetation. As the soil microbial biomass and soil microfauna
   readily recolonize depopulated areas once the trees are harvested, we
   see few problems in restoring the populations of soil organisms
   important in controlling nutrient cycling to sites of small woodlots
   after felling and return to pasture.}},

Abstract = {{When temperate soils are cultivated, rates of organic matter
   mineralization rarely exceed 50\% of total carbon (C) for about 50 to
   100 years of cultivation, and the remaining soil organic matter
   contributes to soil quality by storing nutrients and providing
   aggregation, In weathered tropical soils, rates of C loss caused by
   cultivation are many times faster than those for temperate soils, with a
   substantial deterioration in soil quality often in less than 10 years.
   Here we examine the role of minerals and microaggregation in organic
   matter stability in the search for a stable organic C pool in a semiarid
   tropical soil (Oxisol) from the Chapada de Araripe in Pernambuco, NE
   Brazil. In this soil, 14\% of the C and N was lost in 6 years of manual
   shifting cultivation, after which it was abandoned.
   Carbon in the sand fraction accounted for 22\% of total soil C and
   declined by 40\% upon cultivation, Although silt and silt-sized
   microaggregates accounted for only 10\% of total soil mass, they
   contained nearly half the soil C, which declined by 13\% during
   cultivation. Clay-associated C (27\% of soil C) showed no decline
   because of a mass transfer from sand and silt-sized microaggregates to
   clay, probably as a result of their destabilization under cultivation.
   Chemical oxidation with 0.03 M KMnO4 was able to predict the proportion
   of labile C and indicated a decreased organic matter stability after
   cultivation. Density and magnetic fractionation indicated that
   organo-mineral complexes were broken down during cultivation, with a
   subsequent mineralization of C and redistribution to finer, lighter
   fractions. The most stable fraction appeared to be in silt-sized
   microaggregates and in clays of intermediate magnetic susceptibility,
   indicating its association with Fe of low crystallinity. Even this most
   resistant fraction showed a C-14 age of only about 100 years,
   approximately double that of the whole soil but only one-tenth of values
   typical of resistant fractions in temperate soils, This result indicates
   that organic matter of weathered tropical soils may be less stable than
   assumed, that rapid degradation of soil quality is possible, and that
   organic matter management should be a priority for sustainable
   agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian forest zones are used for mitigation of agricultural and urban
   nonpoint source pollution. Phosphatase activity is ubiquitous in soil
   and sensitive to environmental perturbations, and hence, it may serve as
   an indicator of soil quality in riparian areas. We examined the
   relationship between phosphatase activity and selected soil physical and
   chemical properties and the spatial distribution patterns of
   phosphatase, organic matter, and moisture in a soil drainage catena
   within a riparian forest zone. Mean (\%CV) phosphatase activity for the
   whole catena was 1.220 (40.6) mu mol p-nitrophenol released/g/h
   (p-NP/g/h), with activity ranging from 0.152 to 2.544 mu mol p-NP/g/h (n
   = 271). Poorly (PD), somewhat poorly (SPD), and moderately well drained
   (MWD) soil had significantly different (P < 0.01) mean (\%CV)
   phosphatase activity of 1.516 (25.1), 1.327 (34.9), and 0.800 (39.9) mu
   mol p-NP/g/h, respectively (n = 87-94). Phosphatase activity in each
   drainage class showed a significant, positive, and unique linear
   relationship with soil organic matter and moisture, and activity in MWD
   soil was also correlated positively with pH and water-extractable
   inorganic P levels. When data for the whole catena were considered,
   phosphatase activity was found to increase disproportionally with soil
   organic matter and moisture. Analysis of root mass distribution in a
   limited number of soil samples indicated that in SPD and PD soils roots
   constituted a significantly higher proportion of soil mass than in MWD
   soil. Furthermore, when mean phosphatase activity for each drainage
   class was considered, enzyme activity appeared to increase
   proportionally with the fraction of soil mass constituted by roots.
   Spatial structure of phosphatase activity was evaluated using spatial
   semivariance models. The fraction of total variance in phosphatase
   activity explained by the semivariance model, a measure of level of
   spatial structure exhibited by this variable, decreased in the order
   SPD>MWD>PD. The range value, representing the distance over which
   phosphatase was autocorrelated, differed markedly among drainage
   classes, with values of 12.2, 2.7, and 0.8 m for MWD, SPD, and PD soil,
   respectively. The range for organic matter and moisture was similar to
   that observed for phosphatase activity in SPD and PD soil; organic
   matter had a range similar to that of the enzyme activity only for MWD
   soil. Kriged maps of phosphatase distribution showed that spatial
   co-occurrence of phosphatase activity, soil organic matter, and moisture
   levels was most apparent in MWD soil, less so in SPD soil, and no
   spatial co-occurrence of these properties was apparent in PD soil. The
   spatial distribution of phosphatase activity in riparian forest soils
   appears to be partly controlled by position in the landscape, with
   organic matter and moisture as important factors in determining the
   distribution of phosphatase in moderately well and somewhat poorly
   drained areas, and less so in poorly drained areas. The distribution of
   roots may also be an important determinant of the spatial variability of
   phosphatase activity in riparian forest soils.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript reviews the potential impact of residue management,
   conservation tillage and soil restoration on carbon sequestration in
   world soils. The greenhouse effect is among four principal ecological
   issues of global concern that include: (i) adequacy of land resources to
   meet needs of present and future generations; (ii) role of world soils
   and agricultural practices in the `greenhouse' effect; (iii) potential
   of crop residue management, restoration of degraded soils, and
   conservation tillage in carbon sequestration in soil; and (iv)
   minimizing risks of soil degradation by enhancing soil resilience and
   soil quality. Annual increase in CO, concentration in the atmosphere is
   3.2 x 10(15) g, and there exists a potential to mitigate this effect
   through C sequestration in soils. Just as world soils are an important
   active pool of organic carbon and play a major role in the global carbon
   cycle, crop residue is a major renewable resource which also has an
   important impact on the global carbon cycle. I have estimated the annual
   production of crop residue to be about 3.4 billion Mg in the world. If
   15\% of C contained in the residue can be converted to passive soil
   organic carbon (SOC) fraction, it may lead to C sequestration at the
   rate of 0.2 x 10(15) g/yr. Similarly restoring presently degraded soils,
   estimated at about 2.0 billion ha, and increasing SOC content by
   0.01\%/yr may lead C sequestration at the rate of 3.0 Pg C/yr.
   Conservation tillage is an important tool for crop residue management,
   restoration of degraded soil, and for enhancing C sequestration in soil.
   Conservation tillage, any tillage system that maintains at least 30\% of
   the soil surface covered by residue, was practised in 1995 on about 40 x
   10(6) ha or 35.5\% of planted area in USA. It is projected that by the
   year 2020, conservation tillage may be adopted on 75\% of cropland in
   USA (140 x 10(6) ha), 50\% in other developed countries (225 x 10(6)
   ha), and 25\% in developing countries (172 x 10(6) ha). The projected
   conversion of conventional to conservation tillage may lead to a global
   C sequestration by 2020 at a low estimate of 1.5 x 10(15) g, and at a
   high estimate of 4.9 x 10(15) g of C. These potentials of C
   sequestration can be realized through adoption of regional, national and
   global soil policy that stipulate appropriate use of world soil
   resources. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Maintenance and improvement of soil quality in continuous cropping
   systems is critical to sustaining agricultural productivity and
   environmental quality for future generations. This review focuses on
   lessons learned from long-term continuous cropping experiments. Soil
   organic carbon (SOC) is the most often reported attribute from long-term
   studies and is chosen as the most important indicator of soil quality
   and agronomic sustainability because of its impact on other physical,
   chemical and biological indicators of soil quality. Long-term studies
   have consistently shown the benefit of manures, adequate fertilization,
   and crop rotation on maintaining agronomic productivity by increasing C
   inputs into the soil. However, even with crop rotation and manure
   additions, continuous cropping results in a decline in SOC, although the
   rate and magnitude of the decline is affected by cropping and tillage
   system, climate and soil. In the oldest of these studies, the influence
   of tillage on SOC and dependent soil quality indicators can only be
   inferred from rotation treatments which included ley rotations (with
   their reduced frequency of tillage). The impact of tillage per se on SOC
   and soil quality has only been tested in the `long-term' for about 30
   yrs, since the advent of conservation tillage techniques, and only in
   developed countries in temperate regions. Long-term conservation tillage
   studies have shown that, within climatic limits: Conservation tillage
   can sustain or actually increase SOC when coupled with intensive
   cropping systems; and the need for sound rotation practices in order to
   maintain agronomic productivity and economic sustainability is more
   critical in conservation tillage systems than conventional tillage
   systems. Long-term tillage studies are in their infancy. Preserving and
   improving these valuable resources is critical to our development of
   soil management practices for sustaining soil quality in continuous
   cropping systems. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Excess levels of plant nutrients are being applied to soils when
   effluent from waste treatment lagoons is repeatedly irrigated on small
   parcels of land adjacent to large poultry operations. Therefore, field
   research was conducted at College Station and Overton, Texas, to
   evaluate the effects of poultry lagoon effluent on soil, vegetation and
   surface runoff quality. Two cropping systems, bermudagrass and a
   bermudagrass/ryegrass rotation, and three application rates, 0, 538 and
   1076 kg N/ha/yr, were studied in experimental plots 1.2 m wide and 2.4 m
   long, from February 1995 to April 1996. Each treatment was replicated
   three times in a modified random block design. The site located near
   College Station was on a Ships series clayey soil with a 0.5\% slope.
   The sire near Overton was on a Bowie series fine-loamy soil with a 5.0\%
   slope. Nutrient increases in the soil were directly related to effluent
   nutrient levels and background soil concentrations. Nitrate and
   potassium concentrations significantly increased throughout the soil
   profile to a depth of 914 mm at the 1076 kg N/ha/yr rate at Overton. The
   1076 kg N/ha/yr rate did not significantly increase yields on either
   crop system above the yields at the 538 kg N/ha/yr rate. The
   bermudagrass/ryegrass crop was the most effective in nutrient uptake
   with 51\% N, 43\% P and 35\% K taken up by the vegetation at the 538 kg
   N/ha/yr rate. Nutrient losses in the surface runoff were directly
   related to slope. Nitrogen losses in the surface runoff at the Overton
   site were three to five time higher than at the College Station site.
   However average nutrient concentrations in the surface runoff at the two
   sires were similar with large standard deviations.}},

Abstract = {{Soil fertility differed substantially among three neighboring sites
   representing different stages of a shifting cultivation cycle on a
   deeply weathered Oxisol on the Chapada de Araripe in the semiarid region
   of NE Brazil. Samples taken from a native thorn forest area (Caatinga),
   from a recently slashed and burnt area (Burnt) and from a site abandoned
   after five years of manual cultivation to cassava (Abandoned), were
   compared using subtractive and additive fertilization greenhouse trials
   and incubations for C and N mineralization. The effect of burning was to
   increase soil nutrient content relative to the Caatinga area samples,
   followed by decreases of N and organic P by 20\%: available P by 70\%,
   and exchangeable bases by 55\%, on average, after abandonment. The
   unfertilized control of the missing-element trial gave the lowest dry
   matter (DM) yields, but still those of the Burnt were twice as large as
   those of the Abandoned area samples. The relative yield ratios were not
   changed by nutrient addition, although total yields were increased by a
   factor of 5. In all three areas, the most severe nutrient limitation was
   of P, followed by N. The N deficiency somewhat increased relative to P
   in the Abandoned samples. Addition of 25 mg P kg(-1) soil produced 4 to
   5-fold dry matter increases in the Caatinga and 7 to 8-fold increases in
   the Burnt area samples. Further increasing P levels improved yields only
   marginally and only at high additions of N and K. In samples from the
   abandoned area, 25 mg P kg(-1) not even doubled the dry matter yield,
   and no additional effects were observed for higher N and K rates. Carbon
   mineralization during the 12 week incubation followed the order Caatinga
   > Abandoned > Burnt, whereas the order for N removed in 13 leachings was
   Caatinga > Burnt > Abandoned. Accordingly, organic matter mineralized
   from the abandoned soil had a higher C:N ratio. In addition to the
   nutrient limitations of this Oxisol, samples from the Abandoned area
   exhibited further limitations resulting in yield reductions, which were
   not explained by any of the factors examined. This indicates that
   alternatives to long-fallow shifting cultivation will require further
   refinement of methodologies to measure and predict soil quality. (C)

Abstract = {{Effects of cropping systems on soil organic matter (SOM) in a pair of
   conventional and biodynamic mixed cropping farms were investigated. Soil
   samples (0-75 and 75-150-mm depths) were analysed for total carbon (TC),
   total nitrogen (TN), microbial biomass C (BC) and microbial biomass N
   (BN), and sequentially extracted for labile and stable SOM using cold
   water, hot water, acid mixtures and alkalis. In the biodynamic farm, TC
   and TN decreased with increasing period of cropping but the reverse
   occurred under pastures. These were not shown in soils from the
   conventional farm, probably due to N fertilizer additions. Under
   pastures, increases in SOM were attributed to greater biological N-2
   fixation and the return of plant residues and excreta from grazing
   animals. Overall, sensitive SOM quality indicators found for labile SOM
   were BN, BN:TN and HC:TC, and for stable SOM were HCl/HFC, HCl/HFC:TC,
   humin C, humin N, humin C:TC and humin N:TN. The BN and BN:TN were
   better indicators than BC and BC:TC. The humin fraction was strongly
   related to both labile and stable SOM fractions suggesting that humin
   contained non-extractable strongly complexed SOM components with mineral
   matter and also non-extractable plant and microbial residual components.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of grazing and three exclosure treatments (no
   grazing, no-grazing plus oversewing, and no grazing plus oversewing plus
   fertilizer) on soils (Ustochrepts) and biomass of tussock grasslands on
   hill country under a mean annual rainfall of about 500-600 mm in the
   Benmore Range, South Island, New Zealand.
   Excluding grazing by sheep and rabbits for 15 years, with no oversewing
   or fertilizer, resulted in a two-to three-fold increase in the total
   biomass (roots + litter + herbage) relative to the grazed treatment. On
   all three exclosure treatments root biomass was approximately doubled in
   relation to root biomass on the grazed treatment. With the exception of
   Mg, total nutrient pools in biomass plus soil were lowest in the grazed
   treatment. Oversewing alone, without added fertilizer, maintained soil
   pH at pre-exclosure values and prevented exchangeable Ca, Mg and K
   decline, but had no significant effect on soil C, N or P. In contrast,
   oversewing and fertilizing had the effect of increasing soil C and N by
   5.7 t/ha and 0.6 t/ha respectively, relative to the ungrazed treatment,
   and by 8.7 t/ha and 0.87 t/ha respectively, relative to the grazed
   treatment. Under ungrazed, grazed, and the oversewn + fertilizer
   treatments pH declined relative to pre-exclosure values and values on
   the oversewn treatment. The lower pH under the oversown + fertilizer
   treatment was attributed to the direct and indirect acidifying effects
   of elemental S fertilizer, while the lower pH of the ungrazed treatment
   was attributed, in part, to the acidifying effect of Hieracium
   pilosella, with both cation removal by animals and Hieracium effects
   likely to have lowered pH in the grazed treatment.
   A positive balance of 425 kg/ha of Ca, 680 kg/ha of K and 1900 kg/ha of
   N remained in total biomass plus soil on the oversown + fertilizer
   treatment, after fertilizer additions and previous herbage removals were
   taken into account. The positive Ca and K balance was attributed to
   release of nutrients by soil weathering, and the N balance to N fixation
   by legumes.
   Grazing of seasonally dry South Island tussock grasslands on hilly land,
   even at the present low levels, without fertilizing, appears
   incompatible with the maintenance of soil pH and carbon and total soil
   and biomass nutrients. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.}},

Abstract = {{Production reliability is poorer for poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) than
   for other field crops, due not only to its sensitivity to soil quality
   and weather, but also to its susceptibility to various diseases, such as
   stem rot, which may kill 90-100\% of the stand in the case of an
   epidemic.
   Resistance breeding has been part of the fight against disease in the
   Kompolt institute since the 1980s. In the course of repeated natural
   epidemics an experimental variety, Kompolti Rezisztens, was developed
   from Kompolti M and was tested between 1987 and 1995 in comparative
   variety trials with 5 replications. The disease was only noted
   sporadically between 1987 and 1993, while in 1994 and 1995 it caused
   epidemics which destroyed a large proportion of the experimental stock.
   Examinations show that the variety Kompolti Rezisztens differs from the
   initial variety Kompolti M in the following ways:
   a) In epidemic years (1994-1995)
   While Kompolti M proved susceptible during confirmed epidemics, with an
   87-97\% killed plant rate, the mortality of the resistant Kompolti R did
   not exceed 50\%. Consequently, in such years Kompolti M did not give an
   evaluable yield, while the seed yield of Kompolti R was greater than 400
   kg/ha in all cases.
   Although the morphine content of the capsule, even in epidemic years,
   was 20\% higher on average in Kompolti M than in Kompolti R, the
   morphine yield per hectare for Kompolti M was extremely low in such
   years due to the low capsule yield, while that of Kompolti R was more
   than 60\% of that achieved in non-epidemic years.
   b) In epidemic-free years (1987-1993)
   The mortality rate in Kompolti R stands was 13\% lower on average than
   for Kompolti M, though in two years it was 1-5\% higher.
   The seed yield per hectare was 20\% higher on average for Kompolti R
   than for Kompolti M. This surplus arose due to the greater plant number
   and the greater seed yield per plant, which was 13\% higher for Kompolti
   R on average than in the control.
   The morphine content of the resistant lines was lower in every year than
   that of the Kompolti M lines, by an average of 19\%.
   In summary it can be concluded that by means of resistance breeding it
   has proved possible to select a resistant variety particularly suitable
   for human consumption and possessing not only disease resistance, but
   also good seed-producing ability in epidemic-free years.}},

Abstract = {{The extended concept of soil quality which encompasses the attributes of
   environmental quality, food safety and quality, and human and animal
   health, in addition to soil productivity, has been widely accepted in
   the U.S.A. and abroad. In due course, the indicators of soil quality
   will need to be properly quantified and weighted according to
   site-specific conditions. Nevertheless, many scientists now tend to
   characterize the effects of soil degradative processes and soil
   conservation practices in terms of the time/rate of change in soil
   quality. It follows then that soil quality is the linkage or linchpin
   that bridges the strategies of alternative agriculture and the goals of
   sustainable agriculture. Thus, soil quality is the real ``key{''} to a
   more sustainable agriculture. The concept of soil quality and these
   relationships should provide farmers, researchers, environmentalists,
   administrators and society as a whole with a better understanding of the
   challenges ahead, i.e., a) how to increase the productivity of
   arable/irrigated croplands while maintaining their sustainability and,
   b) how to increase the agricultural productivity of marginal/drylands
   without adversely affecting their potential sustainability. These are
   monumental tasks with problems that will not be resolved by the usual
   ``standardized{''} research agenda. Rather, it will require new
   perspectives, innovative thinking, careful planning, and proper
   organization of both information and people. A vital requisite will be
   the involvement of scientists, extension agents and farmers working as a
   team to conduct the necessary research and development, technology
   transfer, on-farm testing, practical applications and adaptations that
   will meet these challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Most dryland fanning systems depend an tillage to grow crops. There is
   overwhelming evidence that repeated tillage is destroying the soil
   resource base and causing adverse environmental impacts. Tillage
   degrades the fertility of soils, causes air and water pollution,
   intensifies drought stress, destroys wildlife habitat, wastes fuel
   energy, and contributes to global warming. Consequently, most
   tillage-based systems in a dryland environment are not sustainable in
   the long-term. Today, dryland farmers are expected to produce food in
   ever greater quantities. This is becoming more difficult to do in view
   of declining soil quality, most of which is caused by soil tillage. It
   is becoming well documented scientifically that continuous no-till is
   the most effective, and practical approach for restoring and improving
   soil quality which is vital for sustained food production and a healthy
   environment. With this way of farming crop, residues or other organic
   amendments are retained on the soil surface and sowing/fertilizing is
   done with minimal soil disturbance. Research and farmers' experience
   indicate that with continuous no-till soil organic matter increases,
   soil structure improves, soil erosion is controlled, and in time crop
   yields increase substantially from what they were under tillage
   management, due to improved water relations and nutrient availability.
   These changes help to promote a cleaner and healthier environment and a
   more sustainable agriculture. A major obstacle that farmers often face
   with change to continuous no-till is overcoming yield-limiting factors
   during the transition years, that is, the first years of no-till
   following a history of intensive conventional tillage. These factors are
   often poorly understood and may be biologically-driven. Some of the
   problems involve residue management and increased weed and disease
   infestations. Farmer experience seems to indicate that many problems
   during the transition are temporary and become less important as the
   no-till system matures and equilibrates. The judicious use of crop
   rotations, cover crops and same soil disturbance may help reduce
   agronomic risks during the transition years. Farmers switching to
   continuous no-till must often seek new knowledge and develop new skills
   and techniques in order to achieve success with this new and different
   way of farming. Answers to their questions are urgently needed to
   provide strategies far promoting no-till as a way to enhance
   agricultural sustainability for future generations.}},

Abstract = {{Dryland crop production is limited by precipitation and by soil factors
   such as texture and profile depth-that affect water storage capacity,

   factors are not in balance, crops will not yield at their potential and
   productivity may be impaired because soil degradation processes outweigh
   conservation practices. Sustainable crop production is possible through
   use of appropriate tillage and crop residue management practices. When
   adequate crop residues are available, conservation tillage is highly
   effective for conserving soil and water, achieving favorable crop
   yields, maintaining soil organic carbon contents, and soil and water
   quality. Other tillage methods along with appropriate conservation

Abstract = {{The vegetation in a grassland area in the prefecture of Kilkis (N.
   Greece), known for its surface Cu-mineralization, was studied. 43
   quadrats were established along a transect through an area where the
   vegetation formed patches of different size. Cover-abundance and
   frequency estimates for all species were made. Normal Association
   Analysis revealed five quadrat groups characterized by Trifolium
   scabrum, Linaria pelisseriana, Anthoxanthum ovatum, Gypsophila muralis
   and Minuartia hirsuta ssp. falcata. 43 soil samples were analysed for
   pH, organic C, CaCO3, total content of Fe, Zn, Pb, Cu, Mn, Ca, Mg, K, Na
   and soil texture. From a discriminant analysis performed on soil data
   five soil groups resulted, which are highly related to the five
   vegetation groups. Thymus sibthorpii, Minuartia hirsuta ssp. falcata and
   Rumex acetosella are the most important taxa with respect to physiognomy
   and patchiness of the vegetation. The number of species in each group of
   quadrats is affected by the relative favourableness or severity of the
   soil conditions. Metal contents, mainly Zn, Cu, Mg and Na, and soil
   texture are considered to be among the main factors controlling the
   structure and physiognomy of the vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of erosion-induced degradation on soil chemical quality, plant
   nutrient loss in runoff water and water quality were related to slope
   length for a 5-year study from 1984 through 1988 conducted on tropical
   Alfisols under maize (Zea mays)-cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata) rotation. A
   total of 13 field runoff plots involved six slope lengths (i.e. 60 m, 50
   m, 40 m, 30 m, 20 m, and 10 m), two tillage methods (i.e. conventional
   till and no-till), and an uncropped control of 25 m length. Slope length
   effects on soil chemical quality differed among tillage methods.
   Decrease in slope length had a favorable effect on soil chemical quality
   in the conventional till treatment for exchangeable Ca2+, cation
   exchange capacity (CEC) and Bray-P. The soil organic carbon (SOC)
   increased with decrease in slope length at the rate of 0.007 per cent
   m(-1) for 0-5 cm depth and 0.015 per cent m(-1) for 5-10 cm depth, and
   soil pH decreased with increase in slope length. Soil concentration of
   Bray-1 P generally increased with decrease in slope length. For the
   no-till treatment, however, there were no consistent trends in soil
   chemical quality with regard to slope length. Further, soil chemical
   quality was superior under no-till than conventional till treatment for
   0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depths. All soil chemical properties declined with
   cultivation duration, with the rate of decline being more in
   conventional till compared with the no-till treatment. The rate of
   decline for the conventional till treatment was 0.396 per cent year(-1)
   for SOC, 0.21 unit year(-1) for pH, 0.053 per cent year(-1) for total
   soil N, 0.375 cmol kg(-1) year(-1) for Ca2+, and 0.41 cmol kg(-1)
   year(-1) for CEC. The rate of decline in soil quality with cultivation
   duration was consistently more for longer than for shorter slope lengths
   especially for SOC and soil pH. Temporal changes in soil chemical
   quality for the no-till treatment were not well defined. The total loss
   of plant nutrients in runoff ranged from 8.4 kg ha(-1) to 17.8 kg ha(-1)
   for season 1, and, in general, the nutrient loss decreased with decrease
   in slope length. The total loss of plant nutrients in season 2 was lower
   than that in season 1, and lower with no-till compared with conventional
   till treatment. Total nutrient loss in runoff decreased with increase in
   slope length for conventional tillage, and increased with decrease in
   slope length for the no-till treatment. Concentration of plant nutrient
   in runoff differed among elements, tillage methods and slope length
   treatments. Concentration of bases and NO3-N in runoff followed a
   U-shape response over time during the year, with relatively high
   concentrations toward the beginning and end of the rains. The
   concentration of PO4-P in runoff generally decreased with time after
   application of fertilizer. For the conventional till treatment, the
   concentration of PO4-P, K, and Fe decreased with decrease in slope
   length. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Inclusion of pastures in a rotation may reverse the effects of
   conventional cropping and tillage on soil degradation. We hypothesized
   that crop-pasture rotations could be defined with a minimum pasture
   component and a maximum conventional cropping component to accomplish
   sustainable management. Soil organic carbon (SOC), light-fraction carbon
   (LFC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), and aggregate stability index
   (ASI) mere measured in the surface 0 to 0.15 m of a fine, mixed, thermic
   Typic Argiudoll with 2\% slope under a long-term crop rotation
   experiment at Balcarce, Argentina. Treatments were continuous cropping
   and crop-pasture (50:50 and 75:25) rotations, All seedbeds mere prepared
   with conventional tillage, All soil quality indicators decreased with
   cropping and increased with pasture. Data for each variable were fitted
   is an exponential model to describe their variation in time. Soil
   organic C decreased 4.4 g kg(-1) in 6 to 7 yr under cropping and rose to
   the original level (37.2 g kg(-1)) after 3 to 4 yr under pasture.
   Light-fraction C, MBN, and ASI fell 0.9 g kg(-1), 39.0 mg kg(-1), and
   43.9, respectively (97-100\% of the estimated decline), after 7 yr under
   cropping, while they recovered to the values at the beginning of the
   cropping period (1.8 g kg(-1) 99.5 mg kg(-1), and 76.7, respectively) in
   a few years under pasture. Rotations including a maximum of 7 yr of
   conventional cropping alternated with a minimum of 3 yr of pasture would
   maintain soil properties within acceptable limits and meet the goals of
   sustainable agriculture under conditions similar to this experiment.}},

Abstract = {{The projected increase in sewage sludge used on land within many
   countries in the European Community will provide a major source of entry
   for several heavy metals into the soil. Although the application rate of
   sewage sludge to agricultural land is constrained by maximum annual
   additions of heavy metals, there is a need to know the sensitivity of
   those soils to heavy metal inputs which are physically suited for
   application A rule-based classification using weighted parameters
   designed to assess the metal binding capacity of soil and the risk of
   groundwater pollution has been applied to soils data held within the
   Macaulay Land Use Research Institute's National Soils Inventory. The
   classification uses soil pH, organic matter content, texture and soil
   colour as a surrogate for iron oxide concentration. The results indicate
   that some metals, for example cadmium and zinc are potentially more
   mobile in soils than others such as lead, but that the majority of soils
   display a strong or very strong binding capacity for all the metals.
   However this pattern can only be sustained if the soil pH values are
   maintained at their present values; a fall of one pH unit marks a
   dramatic shift towards the weak and moderate binding classes. The
   approach is largely unvalidated but does provide a useful framework for
   incorporating our mechanistic understanding of processes into wide area
   soil quality assessments and in identifying future research
   opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{Baseline concentration levels of trace elements in the soils of Flanders
   (Belgium) were assessed as a function of clay and organic carbon
   contents. Outliers in the data were identified and rejected according to
   statistical criteria. Median trace element concentrations in mg/kg dry

   21.5, Zn 34.5. Clay and organic carbon contents were found to be
   significant in predicting soil trace element contents in unpolluted
   soils. The coefficients of determination ranged from 0.07 (Hg) to 0.69
   (Ni). Based on confidence intervals of the observations, trace element
   concentrations that have a known probability of being exceeded can be
   assessed as a function of clay and organic carbon content and used as

Abstract = {{The aim of sustainable heavy-metal management in agro-ecosystems is to
   ensure that the soil continues to fulfil its function in agricultural
   production, in environmental processes such as the cycling of elements,
   and as a habitat of numerous organisms. Assessment of sustainability has
   to be carried out in time, since metal accumulation in soil is largely
   irreversible and may cause problems if certain concentration levels are
   exceeded. In this study, we provide a concept to assess the
   sustainability of current metal cycles in agro-ecosystems based on
   dynamic heavy-metal balances for the plough layer. After presenting some
   general aspects of dynamic metal balances, we introduce `sustainability
   indices'. These characteristic numbers can be used as indicators for
   potentially adverse effects of current agricultural practices, since
   they account for (ecotoxicologically founded) soil quality standards and
   for quality standards for produce, groundwater and surface water. They
   can also be used to assess the effects of different management options
   that aim to prevent quality standards from being exceeded as they
   provide insight in the dynamics governing input-output relationships.
   This is illustrated with a case study on heavy-metal flows in different
   arable farming systems. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of acidification on ecosystems is reviewed. About 30\% of the
   world land area is acidified mostly by natural processes. Only a small
   part of it is acidified from pollution which leads to extensive forest
   and surface water deterioration in Europe and North America. The damage
   is especially visible in areas of poor soil quality. The acid deposition
   pattern is characterized, with a special emphasis on Poland, It was
   shown that strategies for mitigation of ecosystem acidification lead to
   a decrease of SO2 emissions due to the use of lower sulphur content
   fuels and application of desulphurisation methods. Also, a decrease in
   NOx emissions is observed due to use of catalysts and application of NOx
   removal technologies. However, since about 50\% of NOx emission is from
   vehicles, this improvement is offset by a continuously increasing
   vehicle population, The application of liming, forest fertilisation and
   suitable land use for mitigation of ecosystem acidification is also
   reviewed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Debate on global soil degradation, its extent and agronomic impact, can
   only be resolved through understanding of the processes and factors
   leading to establishment of the cause-effect relationships for major
   soils, ecoregions, and land uses. Systematic evaluation through
   long-term experimentation is needed for establishing quantitative
   criteria of (i) soil quality in relation to specific functions, (ii)
   soil degradation in relation to critical limits of key soil properties
   and processes; and (iii) soil resilience in relation to the ease of
   restoration through judicious management and discriminate use of
   essential input. Quantitative assessment of soil degradation can be
   obtained by evaluating its impact on productivity for different land
   uses and management systems. Interdisciplinary research is needed to
   quantify soil degradation effects on decrease in productivity, reduction
   in biomass, and decline in environment quality through pollution and
   eutrophication of natural waters and emission of radiatively-active
   gases from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere. Data from long-term
   field experiments in principal ecoregions are specifically needed to (i)
   establish relationships between soil quality versus soil degradation and
   soil quality versus soil resilience; (ii) identify indicators of soil
   quality and soil resilience; and (iii) establish critical limits of
   important properties for soil degradation and soil resilience. There is
   a need to develop and standardize techniques for measuring soil
   resilience.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of soil quality based exclusively on chemical analysis is not
   feasible, because it is impossible to measure all chemical substances
   including their degradation products which may occur. Therefore risk
   assessment can only consider those substances and concentration ranges
   which can actually be detected by chemical analysis. Usually, in hazard
   assessment effect concentrations (ecotoxicity data) are related to
   exposure data (soil concentrations of the respective substance).
   Such a risk assessment is highly uncertain because data on ecotoxicity
   for the compartment soil are rare and insufficient. Besides the
   difficulties associated with the determination of mixtures of substances
   in the soil, it is nearly impossible to determine the substance
   concentrations associated with the different exposure pathways, i.e.
   pore water, soil air, uptake of contaminated food, and contact with
   particle-bound substances.
   The same is true for the assessment of synergistic or antagonistic
   actions using substance data.
   These difficulties can be minimized by combining chemical and
   ecotoxicological analysis.
   In the study separated batches of Cambisol, Luvisol and Chernozem were
   homogeneously contaminated with lindane and PCP at concentrations of 10
   mg/kg and 100 mg/kg soil dry weight and with 50 and 500 mg/kg dry weight
   PCB 52.
   The toxicity of the substances in the soils were tested using several
   representative soil organisms (plants, nematodes, soil algae,
   microorganisms). Single species tests with aquatic organisms
   (luminescent bacteria, algae, daphnids) were used for determining the
   toxicity of the soil extracts.
   Good correlation between effects in aquatic (extract testing) and
   terrestrial (soil examination) test systems were obtained for the easily
   soluble PCP in the highest concentration. For the moderately soluble
   lindane, a correlation was obtained for the highest test concentration
   at the early sampling points. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The use of tropical grass-legume mixtures containing the grasses
   Brachiaria decumbens or Andropogon gayanus associated with a mixture of
   several herbaceous legumes was tested on farms in the rainforest area of
   Pucallpa, Peru. Pastures were established by farmers using manual labour
   and without fertilizer in previously deforested areas covered with
   secondary growth. The pastures, together with their grass-alone control,
   were incorporated by farmers into the normal paddock rotation, and were
   grazed by dual-purpose cattle of mixed breeding. Cows were milked once
   daily by hand and with their calves at foot. Following a training
   period, farmers kept records of milk yields. Frequent and unannounced
   visits at milking time by the research team were used to verify milk
   yields and to annotate events such as calving, drying out, sales and
   others. Across farms and years, grass-legume mixtures significantly
   outyielded grass-alone pastures by 9\%. Milk yields on the mixed
   pastures were examined further by stepwise regression. A positive and
   significant effect of the proportion of crossbred cows in the herd was
   established, whereas soil quality (evaluated by the percentage of
   aluminium saturation) had a negative impact on milk yields. Two of the
   farms, which for different circumstances had poorer than average animal
   and pasture management, also had a significantly negative effect on milk
   yield. The interactions between animal and pasture management, and
   regional infrastructure are discussed. It is concluded that grass-legume
   mixtures increased milk yields on farms. Nevertheless, it is also
   hypothesized that they may have a more restricted niche than anticipated
   and that their adoption may be highly sensitive to the overall economic
   context of the region.}},

Abstract = {{Cover crops hold potential to improve soil quality, to recover residual
   fertilizer N in the soil after a summer crop that otherwise might leach
   to the groundwater, and to be a source of N for subsequently planted
   vegetable crops, The objective of this 5-year study was to determine the
   N uptake by winter cover crops and its effect on summer vegetable
   productivity. Winter cover crops {[}red clover (Trifolium pratense L.),
   cereal rye (Secale cereale L. var. Wheeler), a cereal rye/Austrian
   winter pea (Pisum sativum L.) mix, or a winter fallow control] were in a
   rotation with alternate years of sweet corn (Zea mays L. cv. Jubilee)
   and broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. Botrytis Group cv. Gem). The subplots
   were N rate (zero, intermediate, and as recommended for vegetable crop).
   Summer relay plantings of red clover or cereal rye were also used to
   gain early establishment of the cover crop, Cereal rye cover crops
   recovered residual fertilizer N at an average of 40 kg.ha(-1) following
   the recommended N rates, but after 5 years of cropping, there was no
   evidence that the N conserved by the cereal rye cover crop would permit
   a reduction in inorganic N inputs to maintain yields. Intermediate rates
   of N applied to summer crops in combination with winter cover crops
   containing legumes produced vegetable yields similar to those with
   recommended rates of N in combination with winter fallow or cereal rye
   cover crops. There was a consistent trend (P < 0.12) for cereal rye
   cover crops to cause a small decrease in broccoli yields as compared to
   winter fallow.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between farming practices and the quality or function
   of agricultural soils is difficult to characterize because of the
   complexity of soils and spatial variability within the landscape. This
   study in Saskstchewan, Canada, tested the hypothesis that soil quality
   differed among farming systems that varied in fallow intensity
   (crop-fallow {[}fallow every second year], extended rotation {[}fallow
   every 3-5 yr], and continuous cropping {[}no fallow]) and that
   differences could be assessed using soil properties as indicators of
   soil quality. In 20 fields with coarse to fine loamy, glaciolacustrine
   soils (Typic Haploborolls), major landform elements were sampled. As
   years of continuous cropping and related fertilizer inputs increased,
   increases in organic C (by weight {[}C-w] 22\%, by volume {[}C-v] 3\%),
   aggregate size (24\%) and stability (45\%), microbial biomass (50\%),
   resin-sorbed N (503\%) and P (227\%), and nitrification potential
   (approximate to 25\%), decreases in bulk density (8\%) and infiltration
   time (19\%), and greater solum thickness (26\%) were measured. We
   postulate that the changes in soil properties indicate an improvement in
   soil quality under the continuous cropping system and that the observed
   changes were caused by more frequent additions of crop residues (organic
   C), especially near the soil surface, which resulted in lower bulk
   density, more microbial biomass, and greater soil aggregation. It seems
   that the annual inputs of crop residues in conjunction with nutrients,
   such as N and P, resulted in the formation of an active and labile soil
   organic matter, increased availability of soil N and P, and a
   comparatively large pool of microbial C.}},

Abstract = {{Technologies to support precision farming (PF) began to emerge in 1989
   when the Global Positioning System (GPS) became available to a limited
   extent and was tested as a means for locating farm equipment within
   fields. Substantial PF technology is available with rapidly decreasing
   costs and increasing capabilities. However, one major class of
   information that is missing is a method for determining how much
   material to apply or what action to take as a result of a specific
   condition at any position within a field Developing this information
   will require knowing the spatial and temporal variability of plant
   response and will most likely be obtained by measuring yield
   variability. This field study was designed to quantify yield variability
   within a 16 ha field which has had consistent practices for several
   years. Crop yields showed a coefficient of variation ranging from near
   12\% in 1989 and 1992 to over 30\% in 1990 and 1993. Rankings of the
   long-term relative yield for 224 locations were not stable even after 6
   years when recalculated each year Many PF scenarios are based on the
   assumption of a stable yield pattern within a field but only a few
   points in this field have exhibited such a pattern, Perhaps stable
   patterns will eventually emerge, but the time frame for this to occur
   may be quire long. Overall, this study suggests that implementation of
   PF practices within the Clarion-Nicollet-Webster soil association area
   will reveal both difficulties and opportunities.}},

   rich and meaningful improvement, or extension of conventional logic. The

   may be seen as a generalisation of classic set theory. Applications in
   soil science, which may be generated from, or adapted to fuzzy set
   theory and fuzzy logic, are wide-ranging: numerical classification of
   soil and mapping, land evaluation, modelling and simulation of soil
   physical processes, fuzzy soil geostatistics, soil quality indices and
   fuzzy measures of imprecisely defined soil phenomena. Many other soil
   concepts or systems may be modelled simulated, and even replicated with
   the help of fuzzy systems, not the least of which is human reasoning

Abstract = {{Hydrological and water-quality measurements were made on a 44.3 ha
   watershed under forest cover and-following deforestation and conversion
   to an agricultural land-use. Under secondary tropical rainforest, water
   yield ranged from 2.2 per cent to 3.1 per cent of annual rainfall.
   Deforestation of 7 per cent of the watershed area increased water yield
   to 7.0 per cent of annual rainfall. Baseflow increased with
   deforestation, and increased progressively with time after
   deforestation. It was 5.1 per cent of annual rainfall in 1979, 15.1 per
   cent in 1980, 16.4 per cent in 1981 and 17.9 per cent in 1982. In
   comparison, surface flow was 4.5 per cent in 1979 and 6.2 per cent in
   1980, but decreased to 2.3 per cent in 1981 and 2.4 per cent in 1982.
   Total water yield following deforestation and conversion to agricultural
   land-use ranged from 9.6 per cent to 21.3 per cent of the annual
   rainfall received. The dry season flow decreased with time as the dry
   season progressed, but increased over the years following deforestation.
   Surface runoff during the rainy season depended on ground cover and soil
   quality. The extent and severity of soil degradation affected the
   dynamics of surface flow. Because of actively growing crops, plant
   nutrient concentrations in surface runoff were low. Forested lysimeters
   had higher seepage losses than cropped lysimeters, and the water-use
   efficiency was 1.9-3.6 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) for cowpeas compared with
   6.1-11.0 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) for maize. The delivery ratio was high
   immediately after deforestation and decreased to a steady value of about
   3.2 per cent within 7 years. The data show five distinct phases of soil
   degradation in relation to generation of surface runoff. (C) 1997 by

Abstract = {{A wide range of tillage methods (e.g. mouldboard ploughing, discing,
   harrowing, chiselling, notill, ridge till, and their combinations) are
   used for continuous maize (Zea mays L.) cropping in western Nigeria
   without the benefits of experimental data on their comparative effects
   on soil properties and crop response. Therefore, the main objective of
   this experiment was to evaluate the impact of a range of tillage methods
   and continuous maize culture on grain and stover yields and degradative
   effects on soil properties. Tillage-induced changes in soil physical
   properties and maize yields were studied for 8 consecutive years from
   1980 through 1987. Two crops were grown every year in the two rainy
   seasons. Season I lasted from April through July and Season 2 from
   August to November. The eight tillage treatments studied were: (1)
   notill + residue mulch, (2) notill + chiselling in the row zone to 50 cm
   depth, (3) mouldboard ploughing + harrowing, (4) disc ploughing +
   rotovation, (5) notill - residue mulch, (6) mouldboard ploughing at the
   end of rains or summer ploughing, (7) mouldboard ploughing and harrowing
   + residue mulch, (8) mouldboard ploughing and harrowing + ridging or
   ridge till. The experiment was established on a newly cleared land that
   had been under fallow (native vegetation regrowth) for about 6 years.
   With some exceptions, soil physical properties were measured in the dry
   season from 1980 through 1987, year by year. Maize grain yield was
   significantly affected by tillage treatments in 3 of 8 years only in
   Season 1. Notill + residue mulch produced the highest yield in both
   seasons. In addition, ploughing + residue mulch produced high yield in
   the first season only. Mean maize grain yield (averaged for 8 years) was
   3.1 Mg ha(-1) in the first season compared with 1.4 Mg ha(-1) in the
   second. Maize gain yield in the first season increased from 2.3 Mg
   ha(-1) in 1980 to 4.4 Mg ha(-1) in 1984 and then progressively declined
   to 1.6 Mg ha(-1) in 1987. In the second season, grain yield was highly
   variable and depended on the rainfall amount and distribution. Complete
   crop failure occurred in Season 2 of 1983. The highest seasonal yield of
   2.5 Mg ha(-1) was in 1984, and yield progressively declined to 0.6 Mg
   ha(-1) in 1987. Tillage treatments had no effect on soil bulk density of
   the surface 0 to 10 cm depth which progressively increased with
   cultivation duration. After 8 years, sand content was significantly
   lower and clay content significantly higher in the surface 0-10-cm layer
   of notill + mulch compared with plough-based and unmulched treatments.
   Equilibrium infiltration rate was rapid in all treatments, but
   significantly higher in notill compared with ridged treatment. Maize
   monocropping had drastic adverse effects on soil quality and crop yield.
   Adverse effects were more drastic in plough-based systems - residue
   mulch than with the notill system + residue mulch. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Intensive monocropping of maize is widely practised in densely populated
   regions of west Africa. A wide range of tillage systems are used for
   seedbed preparation without the benefits of research information from
   long-term experiments relating tillage method to soil properties. Soil
   chemical effects of eight tillage and residue management treatments were
   studied for 8 years or 16 consecutive maize monoculture crops for a
   western Nigerian soil with a coarse-textured surface horizon. Treatments
   established on a newly cleared land were: (1) notill +/- crop residue
   mulch, (2) notill +/- chiselling in the row zone at 50 cm depth, (3)
   mouldboard ploughing +/- harrowing, (4) disc ploughing +/- rotovation,
   (5) notill - residue mulch, (6) mouldboard ploughing at the end of rains
   or summer ploughing, (7) mouldboard ploughing +/- residue mulch, and (8)
   mouldboard ploughing and harrowing +/- ridging or ridge till. Soil
   chemical properties of the 0-5-cm and 5-10-cm depths were measured
   during the dry season every year beginning with base line
   characterization soon after land clearing in 1980. Soil pH declined with
   cultivation duration from 6.6 in 1981 to 5.4 in 1987 for the 0-5-cm
   depth, and from 6.5 in 1981 to 5.5 in 1987 for the 5-10-cm depth. Mean
   soil pH for the 0-5-cm depth declined from 6.7 to 5.6 in notill +/-
   residue mulch, and from 6.7 to 5.4 with mouldboard ploughing. Soil
   content of Bray P increased with cultivation duration due to application
   of phosphatic fertilizers. There occurred a significant decrease in soil
   organic carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen (TSN), and an increase in
   C:N ratio with cultivation duration. Mean SOC content in 1987 of the
   0-5-cm depth was 13.9 g kg(-1) for the notill treatment compared with
   11.0 g kg(-1) for the plough-based methods. Soil concentration Ca and Mg
   and total cation exchange capacity (CEC) increased with cultivation
   duration. Maize grain yield was significantly correlated with SOC,
   exchangeable Ca2+, and CEC.
   Continuous cropping decreased soil chemical quality, and the rate of
   decreases was more with plough-based than notill methods. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon concentrations (OCCs) decline when semiarid
   grasslands are brought under cultivation. As a result, soil aggregate
   size and stability may decline, which, with the decreases in OCC, may
   degrade soil quality and reduce crop yields. Effects of cropping
   systems, crop or field conditions, and tillage methods on dry and
   water-stable aggregation and OCCs in the surface layer of a Torrertic
   Paleustoll (Pullman clay loam) were determined. Samples were obtained
   from the 0-3-cm depth in plots of four dryland studies and three
   non-replicated field areas. Areas sampled ranged from those cropped to
   winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor
   (L.) Moench) for over 20 years to grasslands converted to cropland in
   1994. In general, soil aggregates were smaller and OCCs were greater
   with no-tillage (NT) than with stubble mulch tillage (SMT) on areas
   cropped for over 20 years. On areas recently converted to cropland,
   aggregates were larger and OCCs were greater with NT than with other
   tillage methods. The 0.42-0.84- and 0.84-2.0-mm dry aggregates were
   among those most stable when sieved in water. The results indicate
   practices that maintain soil OCCs at the higher levels and promote
   development of dry aggregates in the 0.42-2.0-mm size range are
   important for production sustainability of Torrertic Paleustolls such as
   Pullman clay loam and similar soils. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) status of a
   savanna Alfisol under continuous cultivation complemented with farmyard
   manure and inorganic fertilization for 45 years were determined. The
   objective of the study was to determine the effect of farmyard manure
   (D), N + P and N + P + K fertilizers and their combinations on soil
   quality under continuous cultivation. Six field plots from the long-term
   DNPK experiment at Samaru were sampled for the study: D, N + P, N + P +
   K, D + N + P, D + N + P + K fertilized plots, a control plot with no
   fertilization and a native site soil. Continuous cultivation caused
   significant losses of C, N and P. The N + P or N + P + K fertilization
   could not mitigate these losses. Losses of N and P were mainly in
   organic forms. However, combination of farmyard manure with N + P and N
   + P + K fertilization enabled C, N and P to be maintained equal to, or
   greater than, the native site soil. It was concluded that farmyard
   manure applied alone, or in combination with N + P or N + P + K
   fertilization, was effective in maintaining soil quality under
   continuous cultivation in the savanna. In contrast, continuous inorganic
   fertilization was deleterious to soil quality because of depletion of
   organic matter, the reservoir of plant available N and P in weathered,
   tropical soils. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality measurements were made as part of a larger study of
   conversion to certified organic management in a California apple
   orchard, and results are reported here. The general objectives of the
   soil research were: (1) to compare soil properties between the two
   production systems (conventional and transitional organic); (2) relate
   observed differences to soil processes and management practices; and (3)
   determine the relative usefulness of each of the measured parameters as
   soil quality indicators.
   Bulk density and water holding capacity were useful indicators of
   changes in soil physical characteristics. Because treatment differences
   in bulk density were detected, biological and chemical data were
   expressed volumetrically to more closely approximate in-field values.
   EC, Ca, and Mg readings were used as an indication of the absence of
   significant salinity problems in both production systems. Soil pH in
   surface soils was mildly acidic, and values were slightly higher in the
   organic production system plots.
   Potentially mineralizable nitrogen and biomass carbon (C) were more
   sensitive indicators of system change than total N or organic C. Because
   microbial respiration was higher from organic plots on some sample
   dates, C loss via CO2 was evaluated against C inputs in the two systems.
   It was concluded that in both production systems, C inputs appear to
   outweigh C loss via microbial respiration, and therefore the potential
   for net organic matter loss is minimal. No significant treatment
   differences were seen in the respiratory ratio, or in the ratio of
   biomass C to total organic C. Increased colonization by mycorrhizal
   fungi seemed to provide an explanation for higher tissue P levels in the
   organic trees, and thus was an indicator of increased soil biological
   function in the organically managed plots.
   Soil invertebrates did not seem to be sensitive indicators of short-term
   responses to management changes in the current study, as no significant
   differences were seen during 1990-1991, the first 2 years of transition
   to organic management in the organic treatment plots. However, earthworm
   abundance and biomass increased significantly during 1992 in the organic
   plots, and seemed to provide an indication of long-term response to
   changes in weed, pest, and soil fertility management. Pitfall trap
   arthropods were too variable in abundance and diversity to discern any
   significant treatment effects with the sampling scheme used, and
   therefore these parameters were not useful indicators of soil quality
   changes. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Studies assessing the effects of different tillage and N fertilizer
   management practices on distributions and amounts of various C and N
   pools in soil can provide information about the influence of such
   management on the quality of organic matter in agricultural soils. To
   assess the influence of management on soil quality, we characterized the
   organic matter by measurements of total N, organic C, microbial biomass
   N and active N in the 0-20 cm profiles of soil from long-term field
   experiments containing plots under treatments of plow or no tillage and
   0, 135, or 270 kg N ha(-1) fertilizer. Previous work had established
   that on the basis of the crop growth requirement of maize, these
   application rates of fertilizer N provide amounts of N that are
   deficient, sufficient, and excessive, respectively. The studies reported
   provide evidence that the sufficient amount of fertilizer N stimulated
   formation of the biologically active pools of N (biomass N and active N)
   in soils under no tillage treatments, but the excessive amount of
   fertilizer N tended to suppress these pools. The results demonstrated
   that these influences of excessive N fertilization were not reflected in
   distributions of total N or total organic C in soil profiles but became
   evident with the measurements of biologically active N. This suggests
   that such measurements can provide information related to the influence
   of different management practices on soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Topsoil depth is an indirect indicator of soil quality and crop
   productivity. A 2-yr field study was conducted in north-central Alberta
   with the following objectives: (I)to determine aboveground barley dry
   matter yield, N uptake, and fertilizer-use efficiency (FUE) in two
   artificially eroded soils of contrasting properties, and (2) to assess
   the effectiveness of KNO3 and urea in compensating for lost
   productivity. Field experiments were conducted on an Orthic Gray Luvisol
   (Site 1) and on an Eluviated Black Chernozem (Site 2) in 1991 and 1992.
   The treatments consisted of three depths of topsoil removal (0, 10 and
   20 cm) and three N fertilizers (KNO3 and urea at 150 kg N ha(-1), and
   the control). The plots were sown to barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Yields
   and N uptake of aboveground barley dry matter decreased with each
   increment of topsoil removal and were lowest in the 20-cm topsoil
   removal. Fertilizer N improved yields and N uptake at each depth of
   erosion. In most of the erosion treatments barley yields and N uptake
   tended to be greater with KNO3 than with urea. The effectiveness of each
   N source, however, varied with site. At the 20-cm depth of erosion, KNO3
   was more effective than urea. The trend in fertilizer-use efficiency
   increased with depth of erosion at Site 1 but decreased at Site 2.}},

Abstract = {{For more than a decade environmental specimen banking (ESB) has been an
   established approach for monitoring and retrospective environmental
   survey purposes in a number of developed countries. Specimen banking is
   carried out on regional or national scales for various environmental
   materials. The ecological or problem-oriented approach, as pursued e.g.
   in Germany or USA has the advantages of a restricted survey and a clear
   political mandate. Environmental problems, however, are by no means
   national or regional issues, since the diversity and dispersion of
   hazardous substances make environmental monitoring clearly a global
   affair. The structuring of our environment suggests that banking should
   not be limited by national boundaries, but rather be based on
   eco-systematic principles. Such distinct banking efforts should be
   devoted to the monitoring of physico-chemical aspects of climatic change
   and air pollution, soil quality, and aquatic monitoring on a world-wide
   scale. As some experience already exists with specialized banking
   programs for marine samples, such as the National Marine Mammal Tissue
   Bank or the Mussel Watch Program in the United States, an international
   marine specimen bank, based on principles of national ESB's, is
   advocated to be established in due time. Following the recommendations
   of the 1992 Rio `Earth Summit' to pursue sustainable development
   strategies, such an establishment could strongly facilitate efforts
   concerning pollution control and mitigation, overexploitation and mining
   of ocean resources on a regional or global scale. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Africa, with a total land mass of about 30.7 million km(2) and a
   population exceeding 746 million persons, has generally lagged behind in
   agricultural development. Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa) is
   the poorest developing region, with 29 out of 34 countries being some of
   the poorest in the world. The purpose of this study is to develop a Soil
   Taxonomy map, based on the FAO Soil Map of the World, which together
   with other data, is used to make continent-level assessments of land
   productivity and sustainability. Prime land occupies about 9.6\% of
   Africa and the lands with high potential occupy an area of about 6.7\%.
   The medium- and low-potential lands, which together occupy 28.3\% of the
   area have major constraints for low-input agriculture. Resource-poor
   farmers who live on these lands have high risks and, generally, the
   probability of agriculture failure is high to very high. The remaining
   about 55\% of the land consists of deserts or other lands with major
   constraints even for low-input agriculture. The desert margins have
   nomadic grazing which with increasing animal population is stressing the
   environment. A soil quality analysis and an evaluation of sustainable
   production, based only on biophysical considerations, suggest the need
   for major investments to enhance the productivity of the soil resources
   of this continent.}},

Abstract = {{Certain terms and expressions that relate to the environment are
   problematic in that they vary widely in usage within and between
   disciplines, and several have been used as synonyms. In an attempt to
   correct the problem and standardize usage, this paper defines or
   redefines 10 of the most common environmental terms. Two of these terms,
   natural environment and environmental change, are defined on the basis
   of what is meant by natural as reflected by common usage and dictionary
   entries. The three degradation terms, environmental degradation, land
   degradation, and soil degradation, are defined as any change or
   disturbance to the environment, land, or soil perceived to be
   deleterious or undesirable. A sixth term, soil regeneration, is defined
   as the reformation of degraded soil through biological, chemical, and/or
   physical agencies. The remaining four terms, environmental quality, air
   quality, soil quality, and water quality, are defined as measures of the
   condition or state of each relative to the requirements of one or more
   biotic species and/or to any human need or purpose.}},

Abstract = {{Alternatives to landfilling ny ash may be to use it as a soil amendment
   since it is fine textured and could alter soil texture and thus improve
   water retention. However, by ash contains elevated B, soluble salts, and
   trace element concentrations that could adversely affect plant and soil
   quality. Objectives were to characterize leaching of soluble salts,
   plant nutrients, and trace elements in a sandy soil amended with a high
   rate of by ash (similar to 662 Mg ha(-1)). We established field plots in
   an Evesboro loamy sand using typical agricultural equipment. Lysimeters
   were installed to a depth of 120 cm and used to collect leachate over a
   9 mo period. We also used microplots (1.0 by 1.0 m) and similar ash
   rates to characterize leaching under controlled conditions. Lysimeters
   were installed at four depths in each microplot (15, 30, 60, and 120 cm)
   and water applied with a rainfall simulator. Boron and soluble salts
   were leached from the rooting zone after similar to 38 cm of natural
   rainfall or 42 cm of irrigation. Calcium and S were the dominant plant
   macronutrients in leachates while Cu, Mn, and Zn were the only
   detectable micronutrients. Peak concentrations of these elements were
   detected after similar to 50 cm of rainfall or irrigation and decreased
   to below or near initial concentrations by the conclusion of the study.
   Nickel was the only detectable trace element in leachates, however,
   concentrations were variable and <0.15 mg L-1. Results suggest that if
   ny ash incorporation is properly timed to allow for natural leaching,
   adverse effects will be minimal.}},

   area in Northern Mississippi was maintained in a fallow condition for
   nine months. Soil loss from simulated rainfall events was minimal on
   recently tilled plots and an adjoining, undisturbed CRP area. In
   contrast, soil loss from the former CRP site which had been tilled nine
   months previously was similar to values obtained before the CRP program
   when the area had been cropped for several years. Tillage and
   over-winter fallowing caused a degradation in soil quality resulting
   from the decomposition of biological nutrient reserves. The conservation
   and sail quality benefits derived from the CRP may rapidly decline once
   an area is tilled and then left fallow during the non-cropped period.}},

   from simulated rainfall events were significantly greater on sites

   Substantial soil loss was measured from the moldboard plow treatments,
   hut no significant differences in erosion rates were found between the
   undisturbed CRP and no-till management systems. No-till management
   maintained levels of soil quality similar to those of CRP by preserving
   soil structural integrity and reducing losses of soil organic matter
   (SOM) associated with tillage. Conservation tillage systems which
   maintain residue materials on the soil surface may be well suited for

Abstract = {{Good-quality soil is important for crop production sustainability of
   agricultural lands. An indicator of soil quality is the soil organic
   carbon (OC) concentration, which affects the soil dry aggregate (DA) and
   water-stable aggregate (WSA) size distribution. These, in turn, affect
   the soil quality. This study was conducted to establish relationships
   among various DA, WSA, and soil OC variables of a Torrertic Paleustoll
   (Pullman clay loam) using simple, polynomial, and multiple regression
   procedures. Samples were obtained from a depth of 0-3 cm of 18
   differently managed dryland treatment areas or fields at Bushland,
   Texas, USA, to determine DA and WSA size distributions and OC
   concentrations of bulk soil. The water stability and OC of aggregates
   obtained by dry sieving were determined also. Areas sampled ranged from
   plots or fields cropped to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain
   sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) for over 20 years to grasslands
   converted to cropland in 1994. Of the 110 relationships analyzed, 63
   were significant at P less than or equal to 0.05 and another 23 were
   related at P levels of 0.10, 0.20, or 0.40. Variables involving the 0.84
   to 2.0 mm DAs often were significantly related to various other DA and
   WSA variables and to soil OC variables, including a positive
   relationship with bulk soil OC. The DAs in this size range resist
   erosion by wind. Because of their significant relationship with WSAs,
   they are important also for maintaining water infiltration, thereby
   reducing the potential for erosion by water and increasing the potential
   for greater soil water storage. Practices such as reduced or no-tillage
   retain crop residues on the soil surface and thereby maintain or enhance
   surface soil OC concentrations, which enhance the development of DAs in
   this size range. By inference, these practices, therefore, are important
   also for maintaining production sustainability of Torrertic Paleustolls
   such as Pullman clay loam and similar soils. (C) 1997 Published by

Abstract = {{Typical soils from the Ebro Valley (NE Spain) under different land use
   regimes (flood irrigation for more than 100 years and dryland) were
   studied from various analytical data, including classical
   physicochemical and mineralogical parameters, and submicroscopic and
   porosimetric properties, in order to assess potential changes in soil
   quality (particularly soil structure). The submicroscopic study revealed
   marked differences in structural characteristics between the dry
   (uniform, complex granular structure) and the irrigated (weakly
   developed subangular blocky structure) soils, which,nay be explained in
   several ways. When dry soil is flooded, soil aggregates are stressed by
   swelling of the clay present and entrapped air causing immediate
   break-lip and slaking of aggregates. Another source of soil structure
   changes is the ploughing and traffic of agricultural machinery under
   moist conditions in the irrigated soil; these practices create
   mechanical stress in the top soil (Ap horizons) and lead to the
   disappearance of packing voids and the formation of a very dense fabric.
   The B horizons in the irrigated soil show clear signs of degradation
   typically associated with saline-sodic soils irrigated with low-salinity
   water (mainly structure collapse and reorganization of fine materials).
   The use of submicroscopic and porosimetric techniques proved very
   powerful for assessing soil structure degradation: It allowed detection
   of some processes that cannot be properly evaluated with conventional
   analyses. Based on the results, improved water management practices are
   required to avoid land degradation in semiarid irrigated areas similar
   to the ones studied.}},

Abstract = {{Three parameters for indicating toxicologic risk of pesticides to soil
   organisms were compared: the traditional total content parameter, the
   equilibrium partitioning approach, and the pore-water concentration
   parameter. The relevance of each parameter was tested using different
   soil types and prolonged chemical-soil contact time by relating the
   results to bioavailability as measured in toxicity tests. The pesticide
   concentration measured in the soil pore Rater could be shown to
   correspond strongly with toxicologic effects on the soil organism
   Folsomia candida, irrespective of soil type and chemical-soil contact
   time. This relationship is predicted by the equilibrium partitioning
   theory and so this aspect of the theory could be validated in this study
   for pesticides in soil. However, the theory's assumption of equilibrium
   (which implies that the bioavailable fraction of the chemical is
   constant with time and can be calculated using one particular soil to
   pore-water partition coefficient) could not be justified in this study.
   Although organic matter normalization reduced soil-to-soil differences,
   it did not account for the time-related decrease in bioavailability that
   was found in two of the four soil-chemical combinations investigated. As
   a consequence, pore-water concentrations calculated from chemical
   content measurements in soil and a partition coefficient obtained in
   short-term laboratory experiments may not be a good estimate for
   sorption or toxicologic effects on a longer term. The suggestion is made
   to measure the concentration of chemical in pore water directly and to
   use water-only toxicity values asa basis for soil quality criteria.}},

Abstract = {{1. As a pilot study, descriptions of the vegetation and soil sampling
   were carried out on 20 forest sites to investigate the soil factors
   likely to be of importance in assessing soil quality for
   silvicultural/ecological purposes, and to see how useful indicator
   species were in predicting soil factors.
   2. Soil analytical properties, mostly expressed in units of kg ha(-1),
   were examined statistically by principal components analysis.
   3. The vegetation descriptions were treated numerically by assigning to
   each plant species Ellenberg indicator values for F (soil moisture), R
   (soil reaction) and N (soil nitrogen). The indicator values were
   weighted either using the Domin scores for abundance or the frequency of
   each species in the vegetation.
   4. Measures of nitrogen availability (especially mineralizable NO3 and
   NH4) and pH were the most important variables loading Principal
   Component 1 (PC1).
   5. The site mean indicator values for R (mR) and N (mN) were combined
   (mR + mN) to provide a simple proxy for `soil nutrient regime', and the
   site mean indicator value for F (mF) was used as a proxy for `soil
   moisture regime'.
   6. The scores for each site on PC1 were related to the values of mR +
   mN.
   7. A grid formed from mF and (mR + mN) was used to ordinate the sites in
   terms of `soil quality' (soil nutrient regime and soil moisture regime).
   8. Further work along similar lines is proposed to enable local
   (British) ecological indicator values for plant species to be developed.}},

Title = {{Composting for feedlot manure management and soil quality}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{235-241}},
Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Contemporary industrialized grain and livestock production is
   characterized by efficient, large-scale confined animal feedlot
   operations (CAFOs) and equally efficient and large-scale, but separate,
   grain operations. Though both are highly productive, feedlot operators
   have come to view manure as a waste management problem, while grain
   operations face declining soil quality and a reliance on commercial
   fertilizers to maximize yields. Neither type of operation can be
   considered sustainable. Cooperative on-farm composting may provide
   solutions to some of the problems facing our industrialized agricultural
   systems and render the systems more sustainable. In this paper we view
   cooperative on-farm composting as the combination and processing of
   feedlot manure with crop stover to produce a beneficial natural soil
   amendment and fertilizer for those fields from which the stover was
   taken. Cooperative on-farm composting would help protect surface and
   groundwater from nutrient loading, save resources, and help renew social
   ties within the agricultural community. Composting stabilizes nutrients,
   kills pathogens and weed seeds, reduces moisture content, reduces odor,
   and improves physical properties of manure, thereby improving its value
   as a soil amendment and fertilizer. Although some N in raw manure is
   lost during composting, the end product differs from raw manure in that
   it exhibits minimal N loss in storage or after field application.
   Composted manure can become the primary fertilizer for grain production
   once the cumulative N mineralization from previous applications reach
   steady- state. The use of composted manure improves soil quality and
   greatly reduces total energy consumption compared with the use of
   commercial fertilizer. A hypothetical example illustrates how compost
   applications to irrigated corn (Zea mays L.) could result in a net
   energy savings of about 3.3 million Btu/acre, which is equivalent to the
   energy contained in 19.4 gallons of diesel fuel/acre.}},

Abstract = {{Relationships among liming, fertilization, water and soil chemistry,
   phytoplankton response, and aquatic animal production are still poorly
   understood. There is considerable confusion about critical nutrients and
   fertilizer formulations for pond fertilization. The literature does not
   support the high application rates of nitrogen often used. Nitrate is
   more desirable than ammonium or urea as a source of fertilizer nitrogen.
   Problems in ponds with water and soil quality that are related to
   feeding result primarily from high inputs of feed. Organic matter is
   decomposed mostly to stable humus during a growing season, and there is
   little accumulation of highly decomposable organic matter from one crop
   to the next. High input of fresh organic matter to the bottom during. a
   crop period can cause high oxygen demand in sediment, but sediment
   removal between growth cycles does not greatly reduce soil oxygen demand
   for the next crop. Organic matter resuspension without erosion of
   mineral soil has the potential for improving bottom soil condition
   during crops. This can possibly be achieved by new approaches to
   mechanically induced aeration and water circulation and the use of
   sodium nitrate as a soil oxidant. Chemical precipitation of phosphorus
   by application of aluminum, iron, or calcium ions has the potential for
   reducing phytoplankton blooms that result from feeding. The most
   important principle regarding water quality and soil management is that
   a pond has a finite capacity to assimilate nutrients and organic matter.
   When this capacity is exceeded, water and soil quality deteriorate.
   Sediment removal and water exchange only transfer pollution problems
   from pond environments to surrounding environments.}},

Abstract = {{Quantification of soil quality changes following deforestation by
   measurable soil attributes is important to sustainable management of
   soil and water conservation. A study was initiated in 1994 to evaluate
   the effects of deforestation on physical and chemical properties of
   soils under oak (Quercus brontii) forests in Lordegan region of central
   Zagrous mountain, Iran. Nine profiles which were derived from Bakhtiari
   conglomerate from three sites were selected for this research. These
   sites were: i) a virgin forest; ii) a completely deforested and
   currently utilized as crop land; and iii) a forest which has been
   cultivated for cropping under the trees (a type of agroforestry). Soil
   (coarse-silty, carbonatic, calcixerollic xerocherpts) characteristics
   that were analyzed include: bulk density, mean weight diameter,
   aggregate uniformity coefficient, organic matter nitrogen, potassium,
   phosphorous, pH, EC, soluble anions and cations, plasticity index, and
   tilth index. Deforestation and subsequently tillage practices resulted
   in almost a 20\% increase in bulk density, 50\% decrease in organic
   matter and total nitrogen, a 10 to 15\% decrease in soluble ions
   comparing to the undisturbed forest soil. The filth index coefficient
   (average of three depths) of the forest site was significantly higher
   (0.717) than the cultivated forest (0.633) and the deforested (0.573)
   sites. Deforestation and clear cutting, of the forests in the central
   Zagrous mountain resulted in a lower soil quality and thus decreasing
   the productivity of the natural soil.}},

Abstract = {{A standardized dataset of derived soil properties for the 106 soil units
   considered on FAO-UNESCO's 1 : 5 million scale Soil Map of the World is
   presented. It was derived from a statistical analysis of the 4353 soil
   profiles held in the WISE (World Inventory of Soil Emission) database,
   which was developed at the International Soil Reference and Information
   Centre (ISRIC) for the geographic quantification of soil factors that
   control processes of global change. Median values are presented by soil
   unit for selected soil properties, including: pH(H2O); organic carbon
   content; cation exchange capacity; sum of exchangeable Ca2+, Mg2+ and
   K+; exchangeable sodium percentage; bulk density; total porosity;
   available water capacity; soil drainage class; and gravel content class.
   Medians for these variables are presented both for the topsoil(0-30 cm)
   and subsoil(30-100 cm), where applicable. The data set can help to
   refine ratings for soil quality in global environmental models pending
   the availability of comprehensive georeferenced databases on soil and
   terrain resources such as SOTER, the World Soil and Terrain Database. In
   a Geographical Information System (GIS) it can be linked to the units
   shown on the digital Soil Map of the World through the legend code.}},

Abstract = {{This is a general survey of soil quality degradation and its
   consequences on human health and environment quality.
   The first part deals with the large complexity and reactivity of soil
   and its specific position as an environmental interface.
   The origin and behaviour of the main pollutant accumulated in soils are
   treated in the second and third parts. A special attention is paid to
   the main pollutants i.e anions, cations (trace elements), pesticides
   persistant organic pollutants (POP), bacteria, DNA... As they are
   closely linked to the soil constituants (clays, humus...), their real
   toxicity or effectiveness is examined.
   In the last part, the risks of soil pollutants for the environment and
   human health are shortly considered. Direct risks for health are few and
   mainly concern the ingestion of polluted soil by children; as regards
   the ecotoxicological and toxicological risk the Critical pollutant loads
   have to be defined.
   The main risks are indirect and involve pollution of either the food
   chain or of the water and sediments by vertical or lateral (erosion)
   transfers.}},

Abstract = {{Growth responses of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea
   abies Karst.) to elevated atmospheric CO2 (366 and 550 mu l CO2 l(-1))
   and increased wet deposition of nitrogen (2.5 and 25 kg N ha(-1) a(-1))
   in combination with two soil types were studied in open-top chambers.
   Eight young beech and spruce trees, together with five understory
   species, were established in each of 32 model ecosystems. We present
   initial growth responses of trees during the first year of treatment
   which may set the trends for longer term responses to elevated CO2.
   Above-ground biomass production at the system level (biometric data)
   during the first year and root biomass (coring data) did not show
   significant responses to elevated CO2, irrespectively of other
   cc-treatments. Increased nitrogen deposition (treatment commencing by
   mid-season) also had no effect on above-ground biomass, whereas end of
   season root biomass was significantly increased in the high-nitrogen
   treated low fertility acidic soil (74 g m(-2) in the high-N versus 49 g
   m(-2)? in the low N-treatment), but not-in the more fertile calcareous
   soil. Stem diameter increment of beech was significantly increased
   (+9\%) under elevated CO, in the calcareous soil, but not in the acidic
   soil. The opposite was found for spruce stems, which responded
   positively to elevated CO2 in the acidic soil (+ 11\%; P < 0.05) but nor
   in the calcareous soil. These results suggest that soil type
   co-determines the CO2 response of young forest trees and that these
   interactions are species specific. These initial differences are likely
   to affect long-term responses of community structure and ecosystem
   functioning. Soil type appears to be a key factor in predictions of
   forest responses to continued atmospheric CO2 enrichment.}},

Abstract = {{The application of uncomposted waste paper and other organics requires
   in situ composting of 4 to 6 weeks in which microorganisms incorporate C
   into the soil organic matter (SOM) fraction and nutrients are returned
   to the soil. Three annual applications resulted in an increase in
   soil-available P, K, Ca and Mg by a factor of 3 to 4, while SOM content
   was increased by a factor of 1.5 to 2. Repeated applications of
   uncomposted organic waste along with poultry litter (PL) as a N source
   resulted in buildup of soil P. Nitrogen mineralization, C mineralization
   and N turnover were increased more by applying N as Fl, when compared to
   soil amended with NH4NO3. Uses of organic wastes on agricultural land
   include erosion control agent, biodegradable mulch, non-chemical weed
   control, and biological control agent. Potential environmental problems
   from repeated application of organic wastes include groundwater
   contamination from excessive NO3-N, increased heavy metal
   concentrations, and induced soil nutrient imbalances. Pelletized waste
   paper applied as a surface residue reduced sediment loss by wind and
   water, increased water infiltration, and increased total available soil
   water. Developing soil-crop production systems that use uncomposted
   organic wastes along with manures can serve as valuable sources of
   organic C to soils with low organic matter, improving soil quality and
   agricultural production.}},

Abstract = {{Leaching toxic substances out of the rootzone is an effective measure
   for improving soil quality and crop yield in acid sulfate soils (ASS).
   However, leaching of ASS may pollute the environment. We quantified the
   concentration and amount of pollution from leaching of ASS for rice,
   pineapple and yam cultivation in a Typic Sulfaquept in the Mekong River
   Delta, Vietnam, The fields studied were originally uncultivated and had
   been reclaimed 2 months, and 1 and 2 years prior to the initiation of
   the study. Pineapple and yam were cultivated on raised beds constructed
   using soil excavated from adjacent lateral ditches. The pH of the
   drainage water ranged from 2.9 to 3.9 and aluminum concentration from 3
   to 13 mmol(+) 1(-1), The mean monthly aluminum concentration in the
   leachate from pineapple and yam raised beds was about three times
   greater than that from rice fields. The monthly total amount of aluminum
   released by the upland raised beds could be as high as 16690 mol ha(-1),
   and was three to five times greater than that from rice fields.
   Consolidation and crust forming in pineapple raised beds reduced the
   concentration and amount of aluminum released with respect to the age of
   the raised beds. Pollution from ASS leaching was probably greatest in
   June due to a combination of the highest total amount of aluminum
   released to the canal network and low river discharge. Environmental
   hazards make it imperative to plan carefully the reclamation of ASS,
   such that the toxicity carrying capacity of the surface water is not
   exceeded.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial processes within the rhizosphere of crop plants are crucial to
   agriculture. The relation of soil microbial community diversity to
   cropping system, yield, and soil quality are unclear at present. The
   Farming Systems Trial at the Rodale Institute Research Center, Kutztown,
   PA, is a 15-year study in which a conventional corn-soybean rotation has
   been compared with low-input systems (i.e. animal manure or legumes as
   nitrogen sources). The effects of the cropping systems on diversity of
   fast-growing, aerobic, culturable bacteria and fungi were conducted in
   1994 by taking 84 cores in between corn plants in June, July, and
   August. Rhizosphere bacteria and fungi were extracted, plated, and
   counted. Approximately 6000 bacteria were identified by fatty acid
   methyl ester analysis, while 18000 fungi were identified by microscopic
   examination of spores. Microbial diversity and evenness were calculated
   using several different methods. Total counts, diversity, and evenness
   were not significantly different for the three cropping systems. These
   results suggest that conventional agricultural practices may maintain
   high indices of microbial diversity in the rhizosphere. The functional
   significance of this needs to be investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Some New Zealand soils withstand intensive cultivation and support
   continuing high production and yet maintain essential soil physical
   qualities of infiltration, aggregation, and aeration. In other soils,
   essential soil qualities deteriorate rapidly under the impact of even
   moderately intensive management practices. Our objective was to estimate
   the inherent susceptibility of New Zealand soils to physical degradation
   by focusing on structural vulnerability. We took a deductive approach by
   reviewing the available information on the structural stability and
   physical degradation of New Zealand soils. We identified 4 soil
   attributes that are well represented in the national soils database and
   are most likely to control structural vulnerability: (i) stabilising
   short-range-order oxy-hydroxides of aluminium and iron as estimated by
   phosphate retention, (ii) total organic carbon content, (iii) clay
   content, and (iv) wetness. The 4 attributes were standardised and
   transformed and a simple structural vulnerability index (SV) was
   devised. We determined SV for all mineral soils in the national soils
   database. The results provide a ranking of soil groups according to
   their structural vulnerability. We concluded that the index may be used
   as a first approximation rating of the structural vulnerability of New
   Zealand soils to aid resource management.}},

Abstract = {{New Zealand and Australia generate large quantities of agricultural,
   industrial, and municipal wastes. As authorities move to protect the
   environment by regulating waste disposal practices, environmentally
   sound methods of waste disposal are being sought. In particular, land
   application of wastes as a means of disposal, nutrient re-cycling, and
   water conservation is becoming increasingly popular.
   This paper provides an overview of the types, quantities, and
   characteristics of wastes generated in New Zealand and Australia, and
   highlights the problems with current waste disposal practices, including
   landfilling, incineration, and discharging into waters. This is followed
   by a detailed review of the beneficial effects and adverse impacts of
   land application of wastes on plant production and soil and
   environmental quality, and possible hazards to human health.
   The management of waste application on land is a challenging task and
   requires rigorous scientific input. Sludges and effluents contain
   significant concentrations of plant nutrients, particularly nitrogen,
   phosphorus, and organic matter. Their application on land has been
   shown, in many cases, to result in significant increases in plant yields
   and improvements in soil physical conditions and chemical fertility. The
   constraints with some wastes, particularly those of industrial and
   municipal origin, are that they contain undesirable constituents, e.g.
   heavy metals, toxic organics, pathogens, and salts, or have extremely
   high or low pH. High concentrations of nitrate and phosphate derived
   from wastes are also of concern for ground and surface water
   contamination. The processes that control the fate of wastes in the soil
   are complex and many of them are poorly understood, e.g. rate of release
   of nutrients and other chemicals; leaching of nutrients, metals, and
   organics through macropores and as suspended solids; emission of
   greenhouse gases; impact of solvents, surfactants, and sludge organic
   matter on the sorption, degradation, and leaching of hydrophobic
   organics; and the long-term bioavailability and fate of metals and
   organics fixed by soil organic matter. More research is urgently
   required to develop a sound understanding of waste characteristics and
   the processes affecting their fate in the soil in order to ensure that
   land application of wastes is safe.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed differences in soil quality linked to differences in
   the diversity of residues returned to the soil in nine pairs of farm
   fields in central Michigan. To assure that management was the main
   difference within pairs, study sites were selected that mapped to the
   same soil series. Analysis of variance using subsamples as replicates
   for all nine comparisons revealed significantly higher maize (Zen mays
   L.) yield and total and mineralizable N for the high-diversity fields.
   Manuring history reported by farmers was difficult ro reconcile with
   levels of total C and extractable P. To account for uncertainty in
   manuring histories, comparisons were separated into four subsets on the
   basis of residue diversity (DVS) and extractable P (high DVS high P, low
   DVS low P, high DVS low P, and low DVS high P). For these segregates,
   analysis of variance (ANOVA) using subsamples as replicates revealed
   significant improvements in 6 of 21 soil quality indices in the
   high-DVS-P subset. For all nine comparisons, correlation analysis
   revealed moderately strong relationships between total C, extractable P,
   as well as their ratio (C-tot/P-ext), and both bulk density and
   log(infiltration time). When the data were segregated as before, these
   relationships were much stronger for the high-DVS high-P subset, and
   their slopes differed significantly from those of the other subsets,
   indicating that the data points originated from different populations.
   These results suggest a strong interaction between residue diversity,
   and P likely applied in manure, that influenced soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion of cropland to short-rotation woody biomass crops (SRWC) has
   received increasing interest as biomass utilization technologies have
   improved and concerns for effects of fossil fuel emissions on global
   climate have developed. Effects of this conversion on erosion,
   hydrology, water quality and soil productivity may be significant. A
   large cooperative research project began in the spring of 1995 at three
   sites representative of the lower Tennessee Valley to compare the
   environmental effects of growing traditional row crops with the
   production of SRWCs over 3- to 5-year rotations. This paper presents the
   research approach be used to evaluate these effects and a few
   preliminary results from the initial 3 months of the study. Small
   watersheds cultivated in row crops: corn (Zea mays L.) or cotton
   (Gossypium hirsutum L.), are being compared with small watersheds in
   tree crops: sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.), sweetgun (Liquidambar
   styraciflua L.) or eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr.) with
   respect to: (1) erosion; (2) run-off quality (nutrients, pesticides) and
   quantity; (3) groundwater quality; (4) soil chemical changes (carbon,
   nutrients, pesticides); (5) soil physical changes (infiltration, bulk
   density, aggregate stability); (6) soil biological changes; and (7)
   wildlife populations. During the spring and summer of the first growing
   season, few differences in run-off quantity and erosion were observed
   between treatments. One exception was a tendency towards higher erosion
   under cotton than cottonwood. Larger differences are expected in later
   years as trees become established and a litter layer develops. At two
   sites during the first growing season. differences between row crops and
   SRWCs were observed in both the runoff and leaching of NO3-N, NH4-N, P,
   Ca, Mg and K in spring following fertilization of the row crops only at
   these two sites. Wildlife studies on small mammals and bird populations,
   as well as microfauna, are just getting under way. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The concept of soil quality is relevant to a range of human-induced
   disturbances on soil; our objective was to examine the impact of
   clear-cutting on soil quality conditions in six Mixedwood (Populus
   tremuloides-Picea glauca) stands in Central Saskatchewan, Canada. Soil
   quality conditions at two short-term (1 to 5 years) and four medium-term
   (6 to 20 years) clear-cut sites were compared to eight mature Mixedwood
   sites. All sites had a similar, albeit complex, distribution of soil and
   parent sediments. No major differences were observed between the
   short-term clear-cut sites and the mature Mixedwood sites. At the
   medium-term sites, substantial losses of soil organic carbon (24\%),
   soil nitrogen (27\%), and LFH thickness (28\%) were observed, along with
   decreases in the soil surface (0 to 15 cm layer) of exchangeable calcium
   and magnesium (30\%), soluble organic P (15\%), and cation exchange
   capacity and base saturation (20\%). The losses were much lower in the
   15 to 45 cm layer of the soil. Overall, the levels of these soil
   components observed at the clear-cut sites were within the natural or
   undisturbed range as assessed at the mature Mixedwood sites; however the
   amounts of soil organic carbon and nitrogen at the clear-cut sites were
   lower than the natural range. Although the absolute levels of loss of
   soil organic carbon and nitrogen were much lower than in typical
   agricultural landscapes, the long-term ecological significance of the
   losses in these forested landscapes remains a concern.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality is emerging as an issue of vital importance to the use and
   management of land, water, and air. Clearly, we must maintain soils in a
   clean state that is suitable for agriculture, that minimizes the
   pollution of water and air, and that allows for the safe and productive
   use of wastes and by-products as soil amendments. We must also remediate
   many unclean soils that have been severely impacted by anthropogenic
   activities. It can be argued that to sensibly approach these complex
   tasks we must first begin to develop a consensus on the proper means to
   assess soil quality from an environmental perspective. In doing so we
   must recognize that conceptual and mechanistic interpretations of soil
   quality will vary with the intended use of the land and will not always
   be the same for nonagricultural and agricultural systems. Measures of
   soil quality important for environmentally sound agronomic crop
   production will not always be the most appropriate for contaminated
   soils where cost-effective remediation is often the primary objective.
   This paper raises some fundamental questions about the changing role of
   soil scientists who now must contribute more than ever to the research,
   technology transfer, and public policy critical to soil and
   environmental quality. The need for soil scientists to take a proactive
   role in framing, from all perspectives, the debate on soil quality and
   environmental issues is emphasized, as is the need for new approaches to
   quantify the environmental risks posed by soils in agricultural and
   nonagricultural settings.}},

Abstract = {{Protecting the ability of the soil resource to operate for the benefit
   of all biological entities is a necessary and unarguable goal. Soils are
   central to life, and the processes that occur in soils are crucial
   components of the global ecosystem. Protecting these resources from
   deterioration as a result of human activities is the present focus of
   many, not only in the scientific community, but in society at-large.
   Ecologists, climatologists, hydrologists and, of course,
   agriculturalists are well aware of the importance of protecting soil
   quality. So too, have land-use planners, public works engineers, water
   quality specialists, and fertilizer and pesticide dealers become aware
   of the importance of maintaining the ability of soil to sustain plant
   growth, infiltrate and redistribute water and chemicals, and act as
   natural biological Biters. The dynamic processes that exist in a soil
   system are the determinants of the soil's condition, or quality, at any
   one time. These dynamic processes determine the potential of the soil
   to, for example, redistribute water, allow gas exchange, and bear a load
   at a specific time. Prediction of soil quality must project the effect
   of these dynamic processes in current or proposed management systems, if
   soil quality is to be maintained or enhanced.}},

Abstract = {{Bioremediation through venting, biodegradation and biofiltration was
   considered to be a feasible approach to remediate a
   hydrocarbon-contaminated soil from a site underneath a paint factory.
   Before the field-scale treatment process was designed, a microbial
   enumeration study was performed to establish the existence of an
   indigenous population of microorganisms capable of degrading naphtha in
   the impacted soil. A significant remediation of a limited area
   contaminated with approximately 100 Kg of naphtha, toluene and xylenes
   was achieved in a 2 month treatment in which the soil was remediated to
   conform with local soil quality regulations. The bulk of soil removal of
   contaminants was achieved by vapour extraction (about 70 kg).
   Biodegradation also provided a significant contaminant removal (about 18
   Kg). The hydrocarbons removed from the vent system were successfully
   biofiltered and outlet gas stream concentrations were acceptable under
   Italian national law. The biodegradative capacity of a mixed culture of
   microorganisms selectively isolated from the soil was tested in vial
   culture experiments. After 1 day of incubation, four of the seven most
   important naphtha components were completely degraded; the remaining
   constituents were slowly degraded.}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Soil quality is a term associated with soil suitability for productivity
   and environmental quality-related uses It is often assessed from
   quantitative measurements of soil properties that can exhibit a wide
   range of variability across the landscape due to differences in soil
   formation and erosion processes. Thus, the depth to some profile feature
   that delineates the zone in which most soil processes are restricted to
   (effective sail depth ESD) must be included in the development of soil
   quality indices that apply spatially. Our objective was to determine the
   potential of ESD as an integrator of properties that change with depth
   and are wed to characterize productivity and erodibility, two common
   indicators of soil quality. Selected soil properties were determined for
   a range of ESD above a fragipan horizon which restricted sail water
   movement and rooting depths. As ESD decreased from 100 to 20 cm,
   productivity decreased and erodibility generally increased These adverse
   changes in soil quality were attributed to the modification of several
   properties that were highly correlated with ESD. Therefore, ESD is
   considered a reasonably accurate method of assigning a soil quality
   index to soils that have a limited depth.}},

Abstract = {{More than four decades of research and development work in Africa have
   not resulted in the 3-5\% annual increase in agricultural growth
   necessary for most African countries to ensure sustainability of
   agriculture and the promise of food security in the next decade. The
   present study evaluates the quality of the soil resource base of Africa
   and also the risks to sustainable agriculture and soil productivity on a
   continent-wide basis. Fifty-five percent of the land in Africa is
   unsuitable for any kind of agriculture except nomadic grazing. These are
   largely the deserts, which includes salt flats, dune and rock lands, and
   the steep to very steep lands. Though these lands have constraints to
   sustainability, about 30\% of the population or about 250 million people
   are living, or are dependent on these land resources. About 16\% of the
   land has soils of high quality and about 13\% has soils of medium
   quality. This 9 million km(2) of land in Africa currently supports about
   400 million or about 45\% of the people. There are compelling reasons
   for African nations to return to fundamentals in terms of research and
   developmental initiatives. Those countries with subsistence agriculture
   have had minimal inputs in acquiring and managing information about
   their resource conditions. The green revolution succeeded in Asia in
   those countries where there was a serious effort to match technology
   with resource conditions and where advances in development and use of
   high-yielding cultivars was accompanied by appropriate soil, water, and
   nutrient management.}},

Abstract = {{A method is given to dynamically evaluate the physical aspects of Parr's
   SOIL QUALITY. Measurements of two main variables are found to be
   essential: OHI (Optimal Hydric Interval>, and RS (Relative Stability of
   the soil aggregates). The OHI is a range of the hydric content at which
   available water is easily used by crops, soil solid mass is capable of
   being drilled by roots and other useful organisms without offering great
   resistance, and aeration is non-limiting for breathing. The OHI reflects
   the properties of the `'porous structure'' of the soil relative to fluid
   motion and retention, and the consistency of its ped units. The RS
   informs about the relation of water infiltration capacity values,
   gaseous exchange, and resistance to erosion for a parcel of cultivated
   soil, in comparison with another parcel of the same soil kept untouched
   for a long time. Sensibility of both variables is illustrated through
   the analysis of real measurements taken in Argiudoll soils of the
   Argentine Pampean region.}},

Abstract = {{World soils represent the largest terrestrial pool of organic carbon
   (C), about 1550 Pg compared with about 700 Pg in the atmosphere and 600
   Pg in land biota. Agricultural activities (e.g., deforestation, burning,
   plowing, intensive grazing) contribute considerably to the atmospheric
   pool. Expansion of agriculture may have contributed substantially to the
   atmospheric carbon pool. However, the exact magnitude of carbon fluxes
   from soil to the atmosphere and from land biota to the soil are not
   known. An important objective of the sustainable management of soil
   resources is to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) pool by increasing
   passive or non-labile fraction. Soil surface management, soil water
   conservation and management, and soil fertility regulation are all
   important aspects of carbon sequestration in soil. Conservation tillage,
   a generic term implying all tillage methods that reduce runoff and soil
   erosion in comparison with plow-based tillage, is known to increase SOC
   content of the surface layer. Principal mechanisms of carbon
   sequestration with conservation tillage are increase in
   micro-aggregation and deep placement of SOC in the sub-soil horizons.
   Other useful agricultural practices associated with conservation tillage
   are those that increase biomass production (e.g., soil fertility
   enhancement, improved crops and species, cover crops and fallowing,
   improved pastures and deep-rooted crops). It is also relevant to adopt
   soil and crop management systems that accentuate humification and
   increase the passive fraction of SOC. Because of the importance of C
   sequestration, soil quality should be evaluated in terms of its SOC
   content.}},

Abstract = {{Most farmers are highly conscious of the importance of sustainable land
   management. However, the economics of present day agriculture place ever
   increasing pressure on farmers to intensify land-use, often exceeding
   the margins of what is truly sustainable. As a result, farmers
   increasingly demand more information and better tools for monitoring the
   sustainability of their agricultural management. This paper describes
   work in progress. It is our intent to present an overview of our
   research and development of a Soil Quality Monitoring System (SQMS). The
   SQMS is designed as an on-farm tool for monitoring and interpreting
   changes in soil quality that reflect on the sustainability of
   agricultural management practices. The paper focuses on the
   philosophical and theoretical basis of our research, the specific
   approach we have taken and some future prospects for the SQMS.}},

Abstract = {{Bees have been pollinating a substantial fraction of Earth's flowering
   plants for over 100 million years, but fewer than 10 of the available 20
   000 non-parasitic bee species have been managed for agricultural
   pollination. These include the honey bee (Apis mellifera): alfalfa
   leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata), alkali bee (Nomia melanderi), and
   several species each of mason bees (Osmia spp.) and Bumblebees (Bombus
   spp.). Among these managed pollinators, only the alkali bee nests in the
   ground, although ground-nesting bee taxa predominate outside of the
   lowland tropics. Despite their many desirable qualities for agricultural
   pollination, including fixed host fidelity (oligolecty), superior
   pollination efficiencies, reliable synchronization with bloom and
   gregarious nesting habits, ground-nesting bees have generally defied
   attempts at manipulative management.
   Progress in managing ground-nesting bees has been impeded by our limited
   insights into the sensory cues and behavioral mechanisms responsible for
   nest site philopatry and the recruitment of females into conspecific
   nesting aggregations. Candidate cues include olfactory attractants
   (mandibular, labial and Dufour's gland secretions), visual landmarks and
   soil quality. The olfactory cues are likely recognized instinctively or
   by imprinting, possibly at eclosion. In contrast, visual cues are
   probably learned during orientation flights, as is known for Apis and
   several sphecid wasps. Specific hypotheses are reviewed and possible
   experimental designs are proposed in the hope of encouraging resolution
   of these long-standing, fundamental facets of bee biology.}},

Abstract = {{This essay summarizes deliberation by the Soil Science Society of
   America (SSSA) Ad Hoc Committee on Soil Quality (S-581) and was written
   to spur discussion among SSSA members. Varying perceptions of soil
   quality have emerged since the concept was suggested in the early 1990s,
   and dialogue among members is important because, unlike air and water
   quality, legislative standards for soil quality have not been and
   perhaps should not be defined. In simplest terms, soil quality is `'the
   capacity (of soil) to function''. This definition, based on function,
   reflects the living and dynamic nature of soil. Soil quality can be
   conceptualized as a three-legged stool, the function and balance of
   which requires an integration of three major components-sustained
   biological productivity, environmental quality, and plant and animal
   health. The concept attempts to balance multiple soil uses (e.g., for
   agricultural production, remediation of wastes, urban development,
   forest, range, or recreation) with goals for environmental quality.
   Assessing soil quality will require collaboration among all disciplines
   of science to examine and interpret their results in the context of land
   management strategies, interactions, and trade-offs. Society is
   demanding solutions from science. Simply measuring and reporting the
   response of an individual soil parameter to a given perturbation or
   management practice is no longer sufficient. The soil resource must be
   recognized as a dynamic living system that emerges through a unique
   balance and interaction of its biological, chemical, and physical
   components. We encourage SSSA members to consider the concept of soil
   quality (perhaps as a marketing tool) and to debate how it might enable
   us to more effectively meet the diverse natural resource needs and
   concerns of our rural, urban, and suburban clientele of today and
   tomorrow.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical and microbial aspects of soil quality are an important
   consideration when evaluating the benefits of soil conservation efforts
   such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The objective of this
   study was to evaluate the quality of CRP and wheat-fallow (W-F) soils
   using soil biological and chemical parameters and C and N mineralization
   processes. The study was conducted on 20 CRP/W-F paired sites in eastern
   Washington, on Ritzville silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, mesic
   Calciorthidic Haploxerolls). Soils collected from the paired fields were
   analyzed for chemical and biological parameters that have been suggested
   as indicators of soil quality. Potential enzyme activities and soil N
   were higher in the CRP soil than the W-F soil. Although there were no
   significant differences in total organic carbon (TOC) or microbial
   biomass carbon (MBC) the C mineralization potentials and C pools mere
   significantly different between the CRP and W-F soils. Soil biota
   measurements showed there was greater active bacterial biomass in the
   CRP soil but greater fungal-feeding nematodes, flagellates, and amoebae
   in the W-F soil. The C mineralization study suggests that there is a
   significant increase in the secondary C pool of the CRP soil, which may
   indicate a buildup of higher quality soil organic matter and the
   potential for higher enzyme levels. When grass or straw was added to
   each soil type, the W-F soil produced more CO2 with either substrate
   than the CRP soil, indicating C limiting conditions in the W-F soil.
   Since it is unknown what constitutes good soil quality, these shifts in
   chemical and biological parameters may seem subtle. However, in general,
   trends in the data indicated that soil quality in the CRP was improved
   after 4 to 7 yr, compared with its previous management in W-F cropland.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality can be broadly defined as the sustained capability of a
   soil to accept, store and recycle nutrients and water, maintain economic
   yields and maintain environmental quality. Soil organic matter is a key
   attribute of soil quality since it is a source of nutrients (N, S and P)
   for plant growth (via mineralisation) and it is important in maintaining
   soil structural stability. Soil biological indicators of soil quality
   such as microbial biomass C, soil respiratory rate, soil enzyme activity
   and soil earthworm population are sensitive to changes in soil C
   availability caused by changes in soil management practice, and can
   change markedly before any changes in total soil organic matter content
   are detected. The use of such soil quality indicators on sugar producing
   soils of South Africa is advocated to further investigate soil
   degradation and sustainability. The long term trash management trial at
   the South African Sugar Association Experiment Station at Mount
   Edgecombe would be a useful initial study site.}},

Abstract = {{The arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is recognized for its multiple
   positive effects on giant growth and for its important contribution
   towards the maintenance of soil quality. In spite of these benefits to
   agriculture, at present, the realization of the full potential of this
   symbiosis has not yet been reached. The understanding of interactions
   existing among crops, fungal partners and environmental conditions must
   improve to allow for the efficient management of the mycorrhizal
   symbiosis through selected agronomic practices and inoculation of
   cultivated crops.}},

Abstract = {{This paper tries to establish a statistically significant relationship
   between the specific forms of land use and the extent of nitrate
   pollution of groundwater. To account for exogenous influences land use
   variables have been supplemented by variables describing local climate
   conditions and soil quality parameters. The data base is related to
   local communities.
   The results are quite encouraging, taking into account that this
   analysis has to deal with highly complex natural relationships within a
   less than optimal data base. The econometric analysis brought forward a
   statistically significant influence of the theoretically relevant
   variables with the correct signs. Improved results are to be expected if
   the data base could be amended by more detailed local data concerning
   land use as well as climatic and soil conditions.
   Such `damage functions' could be used to make rough projections of
   changes in nitrate pollution as a consequence of a change in
   agricultural policy and market parameters. Such relationships could also
   be of use for a quick estimate of the usefulness of regional programs to
   confine nitrate leaching within given limits.}},

Abstract = {{Rainsplash is an important component of interrill erosion. To date, few
   studies have critically examined the linkages between aggregate
   entrainment by splash and associated nutrient flux. An Oxisol was used
   in laboratory rainfall experiments with two different antecedent
   moisture contents (AMC) and ten different rainfall energy flux densities
   (EFD). Splash and soil organic carbon (SOC) flux increased with
   increased EFD regardless of initial AMC. Aggregates were not transported
   in proportion to their content in the original soil matrix, those of
   2000-4000 mu m and < 105 mu m were found to be the most resistant to
   splash. Energy required to detach 1 gC varied from a median of 1870 J
   for the 2000-4000 mu m fraction to 120 J for the 425-850 mu m fraction.
   Temporal variation in cumulative splash flux and carbon flux for various
   combinations of AMC and EFD indicated distinct patterns. Under dry AMC,
   splash increased during 1 h duration storms and this was explained by
   increased aggregate breakdown by air-slaking, decreased soil strength
   and increased erodibility as soil moisture increased. Wet soil runs
   exhibited the opposite pattern of decreased flux with time, probably
   indicating a complex response to limited aggregate availability,
   increased seal development by raindrop compaction, and transient water
   layer effects in drop impact craters. The formulation of mass-based SOC
   enrichment ratios CER) clearly indicated preferential detachment and
   transport of splashed aggregates between 250 and 2000 mu m. A reliance
   of chemical transport models on concentration-based ER values can be
   misleading, because it is the balance between nutrient concentration and
   sediment quantity that is important for soil quality and non-point
   source modelling.}},

Abstract = {{The results of recent filed experiments concerning the effect of
   long-term N-reduction on the yield and quality of sugar beet, winter
   wheat and winter barley on plots which had previously had received ample
   amounts of N are studied in this paper.
   The yield and quality of crops harvested on plots where N-dressings had
   been reduced for 6-8 years were similar to those of crops grown on plots
   where N-application had been reduced for only 1 year. Grain yield of
   winter wheat and winter barley grown without any N-application decreased
   to about 60\% of amounts normally harvested under local conditions with
   recommended N dressing, whereas the white sugar yield still remained at
   90\%. The yields decreased slightly with an increase in the duration of
   the experiments. Yields of both cereals and beets remained constant
   within each level of fertilization, even 6 years after inition of trials
   with 50, 75 and 125\% of locally recommended N dressings.
   On plots that did not receive nitrogen fertilization, N-contents of
   grain were between 1.5 and 1.7\% for winter wheat and 1.0 and 1.6\% N
   for winter barley. These contents remained constant over a trial period
   of 6 years. The amount of annual export of 55-91 kg N/ha also remained
   constant. Limited N availability causes a decrease in grain protein
   content rather that in grain yield.
   Compared to winter grain species, sugar beet (with 74-117 kg N/ha in the
   beet body) could realize the highest annual export of nitrogen for the
   plot. Differences in annual N export existing between the various
   locations of the plots cannot be explained by differences in soil
   quality. Continuous high yields that were found even without any
   N-dressings may be explained by asymbiotic N-fixation, deposition of
   atmospheric N and a progressive decrease in soil N with 17-56 kg N/ha
   removed from soil resources annually.}},

   dominated in the pasture soil. Soil from beneath scrub had the greatest
   proportion of fungal-feeders; the Shannon-Weaver index (H') was greatest
   at this site and, as many Dorylaimida were present, the value of the
   summed nematode maturity index (CMI) was also greatest here. Soil pH was
   lowest and C:N ratio highest under scrub. Bacterial-feeding nematodes
   were the most abundant group in the forest soil. In addition to
   uncertainty in allocating nematodes to feeding groups, absence of
   information on nematodes in other forest types and on the incidence of

Abstract = {{Conservation of soil organic matter (SOM), especially in high-SOM
   surface soils of the Canadian Prairies, is essential for maintaining
   soil quality and regulating soil CO, emissions. We determined the depth
   distribution (0-50, 50-125, and 125-200 mm) of soil organic C (SOC),
   soil microbial biomass C (SMBC), basal soil respiration (BSR), and net N
   mineralization in four Boralfs subjected to shallow conventional tillage
   (CT) and zero tillage (ZT). Tillage regimes were initiated 4, 4, 7, and
   16 years prior to these measurements on a limed clay loam, unlimed clay
   loam, loam, and silt loam, respectively, located in northern Alberta and
   British Columbia. Soils under ZT were an average of 4\% denser and 24\%
   wetter than under CT. SOC content to a depth of 200 mm was 6.5 kg m(-2)
   under CT and 11\% greater under ZT in the limed clay loam, but not
   different between tillage regimes in the unlimed clay loam (7.1 kg
   m(-2)), silt loam (5.1 kg m(-2)), and loam (4.3 kg m(-2)). BSR averaged
   4.0 and 3.1 g CO2-C per square meter per day under CT and ZT,
   respectively. The portions of SOC and SMBC as BSR under ZT were lower
   than under CT. However, net N mineralization averaged 3.4 and 4.1 g
   m(-2) per 24 days under CT and ZT, respectively. The cold, semiarid
   climate of the Canadian Prairies appears to have hindered any
   acceleration of decomposition of SOM and crop residues owing to soil
   disturbance with CT. Therefore, SOC and active soil C pools were not
   enriched by minimized soil disturbance, unlike results obtained from
   more temperate and humid climates.}},

Abstract = {{Many agricultural fields on the semiarid Canadian prairies have areas of
   inherently low productivity associated with loss of soil quality due to
   erosion. This study compared the efficacy of various amendments in
   restoring productivity to a desurfaced fine-loamy, mixed Typic
   Haploboroll (Lethbridge series) in southern Alberta. In spring 1992, 14
   amendment treatments (including livestock manures, crop residues,
   combinations of straw and chemical fertilizer, and fertilizer alone)
   were applied to a site where the lip horizon(approximate to 15-cm depth)
   had been mechanically removed to simulate erosion. The manures and crop
   materials were incorporated into the degraded surface on an equivalent
   dry-weight basis at 20 Mg ha(-1). The plots were seeded to spring wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) in 1992, 1993, and 1994. The overall best
   amendments were hog manure, poultry manure, and alfalfa hay. In all
   years, yields from desurfaced plots amended with hog or poultry manure
   were not significantly different from plots with no topsoil removal.
   Nitrate-N concentration in the 0- to 60-cm soil depth explained 71\% of
   the variation in restorative ability of the amendments, while
   extractable P concentrations in the 0- to 15-cm depth explained 16\% of
   this variation. Results demonstrate that livestock manures and crop
   residues can restore productivity to eroded soils by substituting for
   lost topsoil. Application of high rates of manure to severely eroded
   soils offers a means of utilizing the large amounts of manure generated
   by southern Alberta feedlot operations.}},

Abstract = {{Extensions of land in which the degree of pollution is so high that they
   are defined contaminated sites are very vast in all the industrialized
   countries. The need to mantein unaltered the indispensable protective
   action that the soil exerts has become one of the central points of much
   environmental legislation which has been introduced in the latest years.
   The presence of heavy metals in contaminated soils represents one of the
   most important environmental hazards. A knowledge of the total
   concentration of heavy metals in a contaminated soil could be considered
   a starting point for evaluating the degree of pollution. Chemical tests
   modified from sludge treated soil studies, are able to quantify the
   mobile fractions in a highly polluted soil, and, if inserted into a
   proper sampling strategy can supply a kind of `'finger print `' useful
   for a good choice of clean-up procedures. After remediation treatments,
   by the same test it is possible to determine their effect on soil
   quality and vulnerability.
   In this paper we present a procedural approach for characterizing
   pollution in sites contaminated by heavy metal. Trigger and intervention
   limits are defined. These are based on a knowledge of the concentrations
   both of the total and of the mobile species typical of Italian soils.}},

Abstract = {{The `'Old Rotation'' cotton experiment was designed to aid farm managers
   in implementing rotation schemes that not only increase yield, but also
   improve soil quality. Six different crop rotation treatments were
   imposed since 1896. Rotations were: IA, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)
   grown every year without a winter legume and without N fertilization;
   IB, cotton grown every year with a winter legume and without N
   fertilization; IC, cotton grown every year without a winter legume and
   with 134 kg N as NH4NO3 ha(-1) year(-1); IIA, 2-year cotton-corn (Zea
   mays L.) rotation with a winter legume and without N fertilization; IIB,
   2-year cotton-corn rotation with a winter legume and with 134 kg N
   ha(-1) year(-1) as NH4NO3; and III, 3-year cotton-corn- (alternating
   soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.] or rye (Secale cereale L.) rotation
   with a winter legume and with 134 g N as NH4NO3 ha(-1) year(-1). Crimson
   clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) was the winter legume cover crop. The
   2-year cotton-corn rotation with a winter legume and with 134 kg N
   ha(-1) year(-1) (IIB) and the 3-year cotton-corn soybean/rye rotation
   with a winter legume and with 134 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (III) had higher
   amounts of soil organic matter, soil microbial biomass C and crop yield
   than the other four treatments. The cotton grown every year without a
   winter legume or N fertilizer (IA) had a lower amount of soil organic
   matter, soil microbial biomass C and N and cotton seed yield than all
   other rotations. In 1988 and 1992 cotton seed and legume yield were
   correlated in positive, curvilinear relationships with soil organic
   matter (r(2) ranged from 0.72 to 0.87). In most months, soil microbial
   biomass C and N was lower in the cotton grown every year without winter
   legumes or fertilizer (IA) than the other five rotations. In 1994,
   microbial biomass C and the C-mic:C-org ratio correlated in positive,
   curvilinear relationships with seed cotton yield (r(2)=0.87 and 0.98,
   respectively). After 99 years of management the `'Old Rotation'' cotton
   experiment indicates that winter legumes increase amounts of both C and
   N in soil, which ultimately contribute to higher cotton yields.
   Microbial biomass C and the CmicCorg ratio are poor predictors of annual
   crop yield but may be an accurate indicator of soil health and a good
   predictor of long-term crop yield.}},

Abstract = {{Opschoor and Reijnders (1991) propose a simple structure for the
   development of physical indicators of sustainable development. It begins
   with the development of two types of environmental indicators: one
   describing the pressure being placed on the environment, and one
   describing the effects of this pressure. The sustainability indicator
   then measures the distance between current or predicted conditions, as
   described in these simple `state' indicators, and a reference condition.
   The reference condition is equated to sustainability. Specification of
   this reference requires the making of explicit choices as to the types
   of environmental change. It implies setting standards which make the
   criteria for sustainability explicit.
   The power of this simple construct is demonstrated using three examples.
   The first Sustainability indicator comprises a pressure indicator
   describing acid deposition in the Netherlands and a reference condition
   based on ecosystem sensitivity to this deposition. The second comprises
   an effect indicator describing species composition in the Dutch North
   Sea and a reference condition based on past species composition before
   this ecosystem was adversely affected by pollution, overfishing, etc.
   The third indicator deals with cadmium accumulation in Dutch soil. It
   identifies two criteria for sustainability, one constraining additions
   of cadmium to soil and one specifying soil quality. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{The use of water polluted by municipal and industrial waste for
   irrigating crops grown in Oguzeli (Gaziantep) creates significant
   problems in terms of crop and soil quality, human health, and the
   environment. The behavioral patterns of farmers is believed to be an
   important factor in solving environmental problems. In this paper, data
   were analyzed by using the contingent valuation technique, and a
   functional relationship based on the willingness to pay (WTP) of
   pollutees was established. Variance analysis and regression models
   provided support for the diminishing marginal WTP theory. Moreover, the
   contribution ratio, the area given over to nonirrigated dry land, and
   income from animal and dairy products are statistically meaningful
   variables in addition to total income and the area given over to
   vegetable production.}},

Abstract = {{The investigation is based on bone element data of early Mediaeval human
   skeletal samples from eight differing environmental conditions in
   lowland and mountain range localities of southern Germany.
   Reconstruction of plausible subsistence strategies revealed close
   correlations with the respective ecological potentials of the localities
   as indicated by proxy data on geomorphology, climate, and soil quality.
   In general, lowland situations showed mixed dietary patterns with a
   prevalence of agricultural farming, whereas in mountainous areas the
   emphasis was on dairy farming production and horticulture. This points
   to subsistence activities during the early Middle Ages that are closely
   adjusted to differing environmental conditions. An obvious deviation
   from this pattern in one locality (Kirchheim unter Teck) is explained in
   terms of successful socio-cultural buffering of limited but effective
   exploitation of the natural setting. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited}},

Abstract = {{Beliefs about widespread soil degradation can and should be tested
   against a quantitative history of soil quality over large agricultural
   regions. Fortunately, Chinese soil-profile data from the 1930s through
   the 1980s now permit preliminary statistical tests of broad hypotheses
   about degradation trends for soils of given site characteristics. There
   is no sign of any trend toward alkalinization in north China. A
   half-century of experience does confirm that organic matter and N,
   though not P or K, have declined over broad areas of the North since the
   1950s. The patterns of nutrient loss raise new questions about erosion
   trends, however. The results suggest a broad-based mt uptake of soil
   nutrients on tilled lands after the 1950s, one that was as rapid in the
   Huang-Huai-Hai plain as in the famous degradation-prone areas to the
   west and north. A rise in China's nonagricultural population and land
   use has not been a clear net drain on the total nutrient reserve of
   agricultural soils, as many have suspected: it is a very slight net
   drain on P and K, but a net contribution to the total endowment of
   organic matter and N on arable lands.}},

Abstract = {{Competition from understory vegetation for water and nutrients can limit
   productivity of young forest stands. Less is known of the effect of
   understory vegetation on long-term stand growth or soil organic
   properties. The effect of understory vegetation on periodic annual
   increments (PAIs) of basal area, height, and volume for ponderosa pine
   (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) in central Oregon at 4- or 5-yr intervals was
   examined for a 35-yr period. Soil C, N, and microbial biomass C (MBC)
   were also quantified after 32 and 35 yr with and without understory
   vegetation on a sandy loam pumice soil (Xeric Vitricryand). Five tree
   spacings, ranging from 2.0 to 8.0 m (154-2469 trees ha(-1)), in
   combination with two understory treatments (understory vegetation
   present or continuously absent) were installed in 1959. Total understory
   vegetation cover averaged 35\% between 1959 and 1994 for treatments with
   understory vegetation present, and was dominated by three shrub species:
   antelope bitterbrush {[}Purshia tridentata (Pursh) DC.], greenleaf
   manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula Green), and snow brush (Ceanothus
   velutinus Dougl. ex Hook.). Covariance analyses of PAIs for each
   successive interval were performed using appropriate stand parameters at
   the start of each interval as covariates. Tree growth was reduced by
   competing understory vegetation during the first 12 to 20 yr only;
   understory vegetation did not reduce the adjusted PAIs during the last
   15 yr. Soil C and N were measured incrementally to a depth of 24 cm.
   Presence of understory vegetation resulted in greater C and N in the O
   horizon and upper 4 to 12 cm of mineral soil. Seasonal MBC, measured at
   14-d intervals from May to November, was greater when understory
   vegetation was present. The results suggest that understory, vegetation
   plays an important role in maintaining soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Sustaining forest soil productivity is a common goal of forest
   landowners in the Southeast, but determining the effects of forest
   management practices on soil and site quality has not been easy, An
   unbiased measurement is needed to monitor sustained soil and site
   productivity. Growth cycle comparisons, traditional measures of forest
   productivity, are not very timely, are often biased, and do not always
   account for changes in soil quality due to management. This was
   demonstrated by comparing growth curves of two successive loblolly pine
   (Pinus taeda L.) rotations, and by comparing growth curves influenced by
   two site preparation treatments within the last rotation. The growth
   cycle comparison between rotations was not a definitive indicator of
   sustained soil quality because stand response could have been confounded
   by differences in genotype and vegetation management from the first to
   the second rotation. Stand responses due to soil treatment in the last
   rotation were confounded by the influence of different levels of
   competing vegetation, Because stand response is a function of many
   confounding non-soil factors as well as soil quality, soil
   sustainability and the effects of management should be determined by
   measuring soil properties and processes directly.}},

Abstract = {{Surface-placed crop residues protect agricultural soils from the
   destructive forces of wind and water erosion. Knowledge of changes in
   residue composition during decomposition of differentially placed crop
   residue is important in understanding the potential effects of
   conservation tillage systems on soil quality properties, including C and
   N conservation and soil tilth. Compositional changes in C and N
   components of buried and surface-placed canola (Brassica campestris L.)
   residue were determined during decomposition in a cold, semiarid
   climate. Decomposition during the period of 23 March to 24 August 1995
   was 57 and 30\% for total mass, 53 and 25\% for acid detergent fiber, 46
   and 46\% for total N and 17 and 17\% for lignin components when residue
   was buried and surface-placed, respectively. Of the 2.13 g N m(-2)
   applied as canola residue, 0.79 g N m(-2) was initially present as
   lignin-bound N and an additional 0.21 and 0.15 g N m(-2) was sequestered
   as lignin-N when buried and surface-placed, respectively. In situ
   mineralization from total residue N was 87 and 82\% of non-lignin-bound
   N in buried and surface-placement, respectively. Surface-placed canola
   residue had greater mass remaining and lower total and lignin N
   concentration than buried residue. These features of crop residues under
   conservation tillage systems are important for protecting soil from
   erosion and improving water infiltration and utilization by crops.

Abstract = {{For adequate quantification of soil quality, specific indicators need to
   be measured spatially. The choice of indicators, however, depends on the
   use to which the quality assessment is to be put. The Multiple-Variable
   Indicator Kriging (MVIK) method provides a novel means of integrating
   these factors into a single index. The quality of virgin farmland for
   maize (Zea mays L.) farming was evaluated on a 250 m x 250 m plot. Soil
   samples were collected from 100-cm-deep auger holes dug on 30 m x 30 m
   grids in the field. Soil pH, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable
   Al++, organic C, and soil depth to plinthite were used as indicators for
   the assessment. The MVIK method was used to integrate these factors into
   a single index. Based on the variogram of the index, additional points
   were interpolated by kriging and a suitability probability contour map
   produced. Areas of low probability for meeting the criteria required for
   maize farming are indicated on the map. Soil conditions responsible for
   the failure to meet the criteria were identified, and ameliorative
   measures suggested. The usefulness of this technique for land evaluation
   for soil management and for environmental purposes was also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning and mowing are management practices commonly used on
   grasslands even though there is limited knowledge of long-term effects
   on soil quality, The influences of mowing and burning on soil quality
   were determined on 2 reestablished tallgrass sites in eastern Nebraska
   dominated by silty clay loam soils, Burn treatments included seasonal
   (i.e., October, May, or July) prescribed burning at either 1-year or
   4-year intervals, Mow treatments included seasonal mowing at 4-year
   intervals, Both burn and mow treatments have been imposed at Site 1
   since fall 1981, Only the burn treatments have been applied at Site 2
   since fall 1979, Soil quality measurements were made at both sites in
   summer 1994, Season of application of the mow and burn treatments and
   season X treatment interactions were not significant, Infiltration rates
   at Site 1 for the mow and annual burn treatments were slower than for
   the control, whereas infiltration rate was comparable for the ii-year
   burn treatments and the control, Unlike Site 1, the 1-year and 4-year
   burn treatments at Site 2 had similar infiltration rates, and the burn
   treatments had slower infiltration rates than the control, Generally,
   soil bulk density, pH, electrical conductivity, total nitrogen content,
   and organic matter content were similar for all treatments, Results
   demonstrate that repeated burning or mowing treatments can detrimentally
   impact infiltration rates on silty clay loam sites; however, soil
   properties other than those measured would need to be studied to explain

Abstract = {{Effective minesoil recovery requires spoils to be converted to soils of
   similar quality to those previously existing on that site. The
   developing minesoil should thus acquire three critical capacities,
   namely the capacities to a) support plant production, b) degrade organic
   matter and c) remove contaminants from water. The degree of development
   of these capacities provides a useful measure of soil quality and thus
   of the success of a given soil recovery technique. At the Meirama
   lignite mine in Galicia (northwest Spain), the possibility of using
   cattle slurry instead of the inorganic fertilizers currently used is
   being investigated. The results of a number of experiments suggest that
   cattle slurry is more effective (in terms of the above three critical
   capacities) than inorganic fertilizer. In slurry-fertilized spoils,
   rapid increases are observed in vegetation cover, in the relative
   abundance of self-seeded native plant species, in soil microbial
   activity and in those physical and chemical properties which affect
   infiltration and the capacity to remove contaminants from percolating
   water.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality guidelines are being developed to address the problem of
   lead in soils. They define an acceptable total soil concentration of
   lead. Recent studies indicate that only a small portion (found in the
   soil solution) of the total is immediately available to biota and
   therefore a direct ecological hazard. This paper focuses on the
   difficulty of assessing the ecological risk of lead in soils and the
   factors controlling the fraction of the total that is available to soil
   organisms. Toxicity data on plants and soil animals used to create
   guidelines indicate that the lowest observed adverse effects occur at
   concentrations ranging from 50 to over 40 000 mg Pb kg(-1) soil;
   however, the tests, using clean soil spiked with soluble lead salts, do
   nor adequately reflect the conditions likely to be found in the field.
   In most cases the lead in contaminated soils can be expected to be
   transformed into relatively stable, insoluble forms over time; although
   the final form of the metal will depend on the form in which the lead
   was originally introduced and the environmental conditions that have
   persisted. The selective chemical extraction procedures used to define
   different `'pools'' of lead in soils, and to define the amounts of
   bioavailable lead, have not been properly validated. The philosophy
   behind the derivation of soil quality guidelines is discussed and
   recommendations are made for the development of scientifically
   defensible guidelines for lead in soils.}},

Abstract = {{The use of conservation tillage management in fallow cropping systems
   reduces soil erosion and improves soil quality. The economic benefits of
   these alternate tillage methods are less certain. This study examined
   the economic returns from reduced tillage methods on fallow using yield
   and input data from two experiments at the Agriculture and Agri-Food
   Canada Research Centre at Lethbridge, Alberta. One experiment was a
   longterm study initiated in 1955 with eight treatments, the second was a
   5-yr study with 15 treatments. Results from the 5-yr study indicated no
   difference in net returns between conventional and reduced tillage
   fallow systems. In contrast, the long-ten study net returns were highest
   for tilled systems and lowest for herbicide-only systems. The long-term
   study had a build-up of weeds that are difficult to control with
   herbicides alone. The resulting lower average yield and higher herbicide
   costs of the herbicide-only treatments in the long-term study accounted
   for most of the contrasting results between the two experiments. An
   economic evaluation of tillage practices requires the entire system to
   be evaluated, not just the tillage component.}},

Abstract = {{In previous studies, the risk of toxicant accumulation in food chains
   was used to calculate quality criteria for surface water and soil. A
   simple algorithm was used to calculate maximum permissable
   concentrations {[}MPC = no-observed-effect
   concentration/bioconcentration factor(NOEC/BCF)]. These studies were
   limited to simple food chains. This study presents a method to calculate
   MPCs for more complex food webs of predators. The previous method is
   expanded. First, toxicity data (NOECs) for several compounds were
   corrected for differences between laboratory animals and animals in the
   wild. Second, for each compound, it was assumed these NOECs were a
   sample of a log-logistic distribution of mammalian and avian NOECs.
   Third, bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for major food items of predators
   were collected and were assumed to derive from different log-logistic
   distributions of BAFs. Fourth, MPCs for each compound were calculated
   using Monte Carlo sampling from NOEC and BAF distributions. An
   uncertainty analysis for cadmium was performed to identify the most
   uncertain parameters of the model. Model analysis indicated that most of
   the prediction uncertainty of the model can be ascribed to uncertainty
   of species sensitivity as expressed by NOECs. A very small proportion of
   model uncertainty is contributed by BAFs from food webs. Correction
   factors for the conversion of NOECs from laboratory conditions to the
   field have some influence on the final value of MPC5, but the total
   prediction uncertainty of the MPC is quite large. It is concluded that
   the uncertainty in species sensitivity is quire large. To avoid
   unethical toxicity testing with mammalian or avian predators, it cannot
   be avoided to use this uncertainty in the method proposed to calculate
   MPC distributions. The fifth percentile of the MPC is suggested as a
   safe value for top predators. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A simplified food web with three trophic levels is designed: plants and
   invertebrates at the first, small birds and mammals at the second, and
   birds and beasts of prey at the third trophic level. Exposure of top
   predators via separate food chains is analyzed. However, most top
   predator species are exposed via more than one food chain (food web).
   Therefore, a species-specific approach is followed too, for which four
   bird of prey species and two beast of prey species with different food
   choices are selected: sparrow hawk, kestrel, barn owl, little owl,
   badger, and weasel. The most critical food chains for secondary
   poisoning of top predators are soil --> worm/insect --> bird --> bird of
   prey for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and soil --> worm -->
   bird/ mammal --> bird of prey for cadmium (Cd). The risk for the
   selected top predator species is much lower than the risk based on these
   critical food chains because the critical food chains constitute a minor
   part of their food webs. Species feeding on birds (sparrow hawk) and
   small carnivorous mammals (barn owl) are exposed to DDT and Cd to a much
   higher extent than species mainly feeding on small herbivorous mammals
   (kestrel and weasel). It is recommended to include exposure via the
   pathways soil --> worm/insect --> bird/mammal --> top predator in
   procedures for derivation of environmental quality objectives for
   persistent and highly lipophilic compounds. (C) 1996 Academic Press,

Abstract = {{A field soil quality test kit was developed to permit rapid assessment
   of numerous soil characteristics recognized as basic indicators of soil
   quality. This study was conducted to determine the accuracy and
   precision of indicator measurements with the field soil quality test
   kit. Data collected with the test kit were compared with that from
   standard laboratory analyses using soils from grassland and cropland on
   two farms in Stutsman County, North Dakota, Results obtained with the
   test kit for electrical conductivity, soil pH, soil nitrate, and
   gravimetric water content compared well with those found by standard
   laboratory analyses, Significant differences in soil respiration between
   the field and laboratory methods were attributed to the inclusion of
   root respiration in the test kit measurement and to differences in
   sampling time, disturbance, and soil depth. Repeated test kit
   measurements were, for the most part, no more variable than standard
   laboratory analyses except when the water status of soils neared
   saturation, This preliminary evaluation demonstrated the field test kit
   to be an effective screening tool for point-scale assessment of soil
   quality by providing accurate and precise data over a range of soil
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The present investigation was to determine the extent to which mercury
   (HE) provokes measurable effects on the structure of the digestive gland
   of slugs as well as to relate the extent of these effects to the cell
   and tissue distribution of Hg. For this purpose, slugs (Ar-ion ater)
   received various dietary concentrations of Hg (from 0 to 1,000 mu g Hg/g
   food) as chloride for 30 days and were histologically examined every
   third day. Autometallography was used to demonstrate Hg as black silver
   deposits (BSD) in paraffin sections. The lysosomes and residual bodies
   of digestive cells resulted to be the major accumulation sites. In
   addition, Hg was also evidenced in lipofuscine granules of vacuoles in
   excretory cells but, however, it was rarely observed within calcium
   cells. Generally, the extent of BSD increased with dietary HE
   concentration and exposure time but, however, it became significant
   lowered after exposure to 1,000 mu g Hg/g food for 30 when the digestive
   epithelium appeared almost devoid of digestive cells. On the other hand,
   significant changes were recorded in the quantitative structure of
   digestive tubules. Mean Epithelial Thickness (MET), Mean Luminal Radius
   (MLR) and Mean Diverticular Radius (MDR) were recorded as measures of
   the sublethal biological effect of Hg. MET, MLR/MET and MET/MDR were
   affected by Hg concentration (C), exposure time (T) and CxT interaction,
   changes in MET, MLR, MLR/MET and MET/MDR being explained by regression
   models after logarithmic transformation of the data. In order to explain
   the nature of the changes in the quantitative structure of the digestive
   tubules this investigation was complemented with qualitative
   histological observations. According to them, the excretory activity in
   digestive cells was initially enhanced. Afterwards, the relative numbers
   of digestive cells declined until the extreme cases of exposure to 1,000
   mu g Hg/g for 27 to 30 days in which the digestive epithelium was mostly
   comprised of calcium and excretory cells. Concomitantly, some changes
   took place in blood vessels where Leydig cells became disrupted and the
   connective tissue layers thickened. Finally, it is suggested to use
   slugs in soil quality assessment as sentinel organisms (''Slug Watch'')
   in which biomarkers of exposure to metallic pollutants and of biological
   effect are recorded.}},

Abstract = {{An earlier analysis of yield trends of stubble-wheat in six cropping
   systems, over 35 yr, in a thin Black Chemozemic soil at Indian Head,
   Saskatchewan, showed that fertilizer improved soil quality, while
   absence of fertilizer, combined with frequent fallowing, led to soil
   degradation. The inclusion of a legume green manure crop in the rotation
   failed to maintain soil fertility, apparently because legumes do not
   supply P. Because the fertility and stored moisture effects were
   confounded, we conducted a growth chamber experiment to quantify soil
   responses to N and P in these six cropping systems. Soil from the top
   15-cm of the rotation phase that had just grown two successive wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) crops was used. Various factorial combinations of
   ammonium nitrate-N and triple superphosphate-P were applied at N/P2O5
   rates up to 200/200 kg ha(-1). Soil moisture was maintained in the
   available range. Regression analysis showed that the fallow-wheat-wheat
   (F-W-W) and continuous wheat (Cent W) systems that had not been
   fertilized in 35 yr, and which had moderate amounts of NaHCO3-P, only
   responded to N. In contrast, the green manure (GM)- and hay (H)-
   containing systems, which had also nor been fertilized before, had low
   levels of NaHCO3-P and responded to both N and P. In the field, the
   yields of wheat grown on stubble in 1991 rated: Cent W (N + P) > F-W-W
   (N + P) > F-W-W-H-H-H > Cent W > GM-W-W > F-W-W. However, in the growth
   chamber the rating was: Cent W (N + P) > F-W-W-H-H-H > GM-W-W > Cent W >
   F-W-W (N + P) > F-W-W. We suggest that the growth chamber results more
   accurately reflect the present fertility status of these soils, because
   fertility is no longer confounded with soil moisture. Grain yields in
   the growth chamber were directly proportional to the previously measured
   initial potential rate of N mineralization, indicating the value of the
   latter parameter as a useful index of soil N fertility.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of bottom soils from three recently-established (newer) and
   three order ponds on each of two, semi-intensive shrimp farms near
   Choluteca, Honduras, revealed that the 0 to 2.5 cm layer had greater
   concentrations of most variables than deeper layers. Concentrations of
   total carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, calcium, iron, manganese,
   and zinc were greater in older than in newer ponds on one or the other
   of the farms. After 8-11 y of continuous production, total carbon
   concentrations varied over pond bottoms, and concentrations usually were
   greatest (1.5-2.5\%) in intersections. Nitrogen concentrations were
   about 20\% those of carbon and changes in nitrogen concentration closely
   followed those of carbon. Precipitation of iron pyrite (FeS2) in
   anaerobic soil layers was the apparent cause of sulphur accumulation in
   older ponds. Phosphorus accumulated in older ponds on the farm where
   heavy doses of fertilizer were applied. Soils of both older and newer
   ponds on both farms had large accumulations of major cations, a large
   portion of which were water-soluble salts. There was no evidence of

Abstract = {{Applications of sewage sludge and lime have been used to restore some of
   the nearly 1.0 million ha of unreclaimed acid mine spoils in the United
   States. Earthworms might also aid in the reconstruction of mine spoils,
   but the earthworm response to mine spoils and sludge has not been widely
   studied. The objective of the present study was to examine growth of the
   earthworm Lumbricus terrestris in pots containing acid mine spoils,
   sewage sludge, and lime, and the growth of two common reclamation
   grasses, timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and tall fescue (Festuca
   arundinacea Schreb.), to the addition of earthworms. After 10 weeks,
   earthworms growing in the mine spoil treated with sewage sludge showed
   an increase in mean specific mass of 26.9\% and in projected specific
   area of 24.5\%. In contrast, earthworms growing on mine spoils without
   sludge decreased in mass by an average of 39.6\% and in area by 21.0\%.
   Soil pH influenced earthworm area, but not mass: earthworms growing on
   mine spoils (with or without sludge) showed an increase in mean surface
   area of 2.9\% at pH 5.3) and a decrease of 11.2\% at pH 6.5. The
   presence of earthworms significantly increased the belowground
   production of plant roots, but had no effect on either soil bulk density
   or above-ground production of plant biomass. The addition of earthworms
   to acid mine spoils treated with sewage sludge and lime might aid in the
   redevelopment of soil quality and biological diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal changes in soil chemical and nutritional properties were
   evaluated in a long-term experiment conducted on Alfisols in West
   Africa. Effects of land use and cropping duration on soil chemical
   properties at 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depths were evaluated for five
   treatments: (1) alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala established on
   the contour at 4-m intervals; (2) mucuna (Mucuna utilis) fallowing for 1
   year followed by maize (Zea mays)-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) cultivation
   for 2 years on severely degraded land; (3) fallowing with mucuna on
   moderately degraded soils; (4) ley farming involving growing improved
   pastures for 1 year, grazing for the second year, and growing
   maize-cowpea for the third year on severely degraded land; (5) ley
   farming on moderately degraded soils. Soil chemical properties were
   measured once every year from 1982 through 1986 during the dry season,
   and included pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TSN),
   Bray-P, exchangeable cations, and effective cation exchange capacity
   (CEC). Regardless of the cropping system treatments, soil chemical
   quality decreased with cultivation time. The rate of decrease at 0-5 cm
   depth was 0.23 units year(-1) for pH, 0.05 per cent year(-1) for SOC,
   0.012 per cent year(-1) for TSN, 0.49 cmol kg(-1) year(-1) for Ca2+,
   0.03 cmol kg(-1) year(-1) for Mg2+, 0.018 cmol kg(-1) year(-1) for K+,
   and 0.48 cmol kg(-1) year(-1) for CEC. Although there was also a general
   decrease in soil chemical quality at 5-10 cm depth, the trends were not
   clearly defined. In contrast to the decrease in soil properties given
   above, there was an increase in concentration at 0-5 cm depth of total
   acidity with cultivation time at the rate of 0.62 cmol kg(-1) year(-1)
   and of Mn3+ concentration at the rate of 0.081 cmol kg(-1) year(-1).
   Continuous cropping also increased the concentration of Bray-P at 0-5 cm
   depth due to application of phosphatic fertilizer. Trends in soil
   chemical properties were not clearly defined with regards to cropping
   system treatments. In general, however, soil chemical properties were
   relatively favorable in ley farming and mucuna fallowing treatments
   imposed on moderately degraded soils. Results are discussed in terms of
   recommended rates of fertilizer use, in view of soil test values,
   expected yields, and critical limits of soil properties.}},

Abstract = {{The evaluation of soil quality requires definitive, measurable criteria.
   Our objective was to develop a field assay for identifying the specific
   soil attributes that govern the quality of soil for biomass production.
   The technique involved the removal of surface soil and subsequent
   deposition of soils with diverse attributes. As an initial evaluation of
   this approach, 36 diverse soils were deposited in a replicated design at
   each of two sites (dryland and irrigated), and the soils were seeded to
   cereals for three subsequent years. Crop growth was highly responsive to
   variation in soil properties, Dry matter yields on dryland in the year
   after establishment, for example, ranged from 5.4 to 9.4 Mg ha(-1)
   (excluding two subsurface soils). These findings demonstrate that
   variation in soil quality has a quantifiable influence on productivity,
   and suggest a useful supplementary role for the proposed approach in
   identifying soil quality criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Soil carbon (C) management is vital for sandy southeastern Coastal Plain
   (SCP) soils that are naturally low in C. A long-term investigation began
   in 1979 to determine if conservation tillage would increase the C
   content of a Norfolk loamy sand (Typic Kandiudult) with a cropping
   system that included corn (Zea mays L.) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)
   soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).
   Plots were 60 m (196.8 ft) long and 23 m (75.5 ft) wide with five
   replications Before modern conservation tillage technology was
   available, increasing soil C was believed to be nearly impossible under
   row crop production, particularly if cotton and soybean were part of the
   rotation. Tillage (conventional vs. conservation) war the main plot
   treatment. At the beginning of the experiment, C contents were not
   significantly different. In years 9 to 14, the mean C content of the 0-
   to 5-cm (0- to 2-in) depth for conservation tillage war nearly double
   that for conventional tillage: 12.0 vs 7.2 g kg(-1) (1.2 and 0.72\%) (P
   less than or equal to 0.05). The r(2) of C content vs time over the 14
   years was 0.44 for the 0- to 5-cm layer of the conservation tillage
   plots. The slope was 0.61 g kg(-1) yr(-1) (0.06\%) and the probability
   that the slope was zero was < 0.001. A smaller slope increase of 0.17 g
   kg(-1) yr(-1) (0.017\%) also existed for conservation tillage at the 5-
   to 10-cm (2.0- to 3.9-in) depth. The C content was not consistently
   different between tillage treatments below the 15-cm (5.9-in) depth.
   Improved equipment, management and soil quality allowed conservation
   tillage plots to produce greater yields during years 9 to 14. Long-term
   conservation tillage of row crops appears to be a viable method of
   increasing the C content of sandy SCP soil even when soybean and cotton
   are part of the rotation.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon levels have declined 24 to 60\% on many Great Plains
   soils since initial cultivation. Integrated crop and livestock systems
   could help reverse this trend, therefore we examined the extent of use,
   the factors affecting use, and the potential for this system. The 1992
   U.S. Department of Commerce data indicate that land in integrated
   systems is limited to less than 10\% of the agricultural land. However,
   expiration of the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has created
   interest in integrated systems. Economists report that after CRP
   contracts expire, perennial forages and livestock systems may be the
   most profitable; however, a survey of growers indicates that 63\% of all
   CRP acres will go back to crop production. Recent research in Wyoming
   shows that returning CRP land to production using wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L.)-fallow practices quickly degrades soil quality. A doubling
   of grazing fees would mean an 18\% reduction in demand for public land,
   which could mean more options for CRP acreage after contract expiration.
   Exemplified successful systems are the Australia wheat-sheep (Ovis aries
   L.) system, perennial legume-wheat rotation in southern Alberta, grass
   community establishment on marginal Wyoming cropland, and an alternative
   (organic) farming system in South Dakota. Benefits include the
   opportunity for soil quality improvement, economic diversity, and pest
   control. However, tradition, lack of managerial experience, and
   necessary alteration in farm-ranch infrastructure may slow adoption.
   Generally, dryland integrated systems are agriclimatic zone specific,
   and represent a potential ecologically and economically sustainable form
   of agriculture. Scientists and producers have to identify and develop
   appropriate integrated systems that fit the natural resource base.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of the soil liquid phase (or pore water) for assessment
   of hazard and risk of contaminants to soil organisms has recently been
   recognized by several researchers. A particular concentration of
   contaminant in the pore water of different soils has been shown to
   produce similar toxicological effects. A particular content of
   contaminant in the soil as a whole, however, exhibits a range of
   toxicity in different soils. These insights raised the need for tests in
   which soil organisms are exposed to chemicals in natural or surrogate
   pore water. The present study assessed the suitability of seven species
   of soil invertebrate for carrying out toxicological tests for pesticides
   in water. Requirements were that the organisms had to survive in water,
   be easy to handle, be easy to bread, be sensitive to pesticides, and
   show unambiguous toxicological effects. The organisms tested were the
   nematodes Plectus parietinus and Globodera rostochiensis, the white
   potworms Enchytraeus buchholzi and Euchytraeus albidus, the manure worm
   Eisenia fetida, the mite Caloglyphus mycophagus and the springtail
   Folsomia candida. The springtail Folsomia candida met all the
   requirements and proved to be the most suitable of the organisms tested
   for soil quality assessment using soil pore water.}},

Title = {{Weed science beyond the weeds: The role of integrated weed management
   (IWM) in agroecosystem health}},
Journal = {{WEED SCIENCE}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{437-445}},
Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Integrated weed management (IWM) research has focused on how crop yields
   and weed interference are affected by changes in management, e.g.,
   tillage, herbicide application timing and rates, cover crops, and
   planting patterns, Acceptance of IWM will depend on recommendation of
   specific strategies that manage weeds and maintain crop productivity;
   such research will and should continue, However, IWM needs to move from
   a descriptive to a predictive phase if long-term strategies are to be
   adopted, Linking management changes with crop-weed modeling that
   includes such components as weed population dynamics and the
   ecophysiological basis of competition will help predict future weed
   problems and solutions and the economic risks and benefits of
   intervention, Predictive approaches would help incorporate IWM into
   models of the processes that occur in agricultural systems at wider
   spatial and temporal scales, i.e., in agroecosystems comprised of the
   interactions among organisms (including humans) and the environment, It
   is at these larger scales that decisions about management are initiated
   and where questions about the long-term consequences and constraints of
   IWM and agriculture are often asked, These questions can be addressed by
   agroecosystem health, an approach that integrates biophysical, social,
   and economic concerns and recognizes that agriculture is part of a world
   with many complex subsystems and interactions, Indicators are used to
   examine the status of an agroecosystem, e.g., whether or not it contains
   all that is necessary to continue functioning, Indicators include soil
   quality, crop productivity, and water quality; all of these are related
   to the rationale of IWM, hence IWM can he linked to agroecosystem
   health, Ancillary effects of using IWM relate to other indicators such
   as diversity and energy efficiency, Linking IWM to agroecosystem health
   has at least two benefits: (1) predictive models within IWM can be
   incorporated into larger agroecosystem models to explore hitherto
   unforseen problems or benefits of IWM, and (2) the relevance and
   benefits of IWM should become clearer to the public and government
   agencies who otherwise might not examine how IWM promotes many of the
   larger social, economic and environmental goals being promulgated.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in the use of green manures has revived because of their role
   in improving soil quality and their beneficial N and non-N rotation
   effects. This study evaluated biomass production, N content, radiation
   interception (RI), and radiation use efficiency (RUE) of pea (Pisum
   sativum L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth)
   mixtures. Treatments were a three-way factorial of pea genotype
   ('Century' vs. `Tipu'), pea planting density (90 vs. 224 kg ha(-1)), and
   cropping mixture (sole-cropped pea vs. pea planted with a mixture of oat
   and hairy vetch). A mixture of oat and vetch without pea was also
   planted. Treatments were planted in early June on a Caribou gravelly
   loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid Typic Haplorthods) in Presque Isle,
   ME, in 1993 and 1994. Biomass production and radiation interception were
   measured by repeated sampling. Mixture biomass was affected by a year x
   pea density interaction: respective yields for mixtures containing
   low-density and high-density pea were 770 and 880 g m(-2) in 1993 vs.
   820 and 730 g m(-2) in 1994. Mixture N content paralleled biomass
   production and averaged 20.9 g m(-2) across all treatments. While pea
   sole crops did not consistently produce biomass or N equal to
   three-species mixtures, the two-species mixture of oat and vetch did,
   yielding 820 g m(-2) of biomass and 21.7 g m(-2) of N, averaged over the
   2 yr. Multiple regression showed that 61\% of the variability in mixture
   biomass production was accounted for by a combination of early-season
   pea RI and midseason total mixture RUE. Economic analyses showed that
   rotations including these green manures may be economically competitive
   with a conventional rotation of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) undersown
   with clover (Trifolium spp.) in a potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)
   production system.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality indices are attempts to classify soil conditions and to
   compare these conditions to their historical use. From this information
   it may be possible to determine which uses of soils are better for the
   long-range goals of agriculture and society. With many factors involved
   in the profitable production of safe foodstuffs without significant
   degradation of the environment and soils, an indicator that represents a
   broad biological perspective of quality is appropriate. Among a group of
   biological indicators, the ratio of crop N uptake to mineralized N as
   determined by microbial respiration plus net mineralized N found over a
   growing season is an useful indicator of soil quality. An evaluation of
   the 12-year-old Farming Systems Trial at the Rodale Institute Research
   Center indicated that soils in plots that had been conventionally
   managed were of lower quality than soil treated with manure or planted
   with legume-cash grain crops.}},

Abstract = {{Soil management practices that contribute to increased soil productivity
   and long-term sustainable agricultural production have been neglected
   over the last four decades. The need to increase soil productivity led
   to the evaluation of a system of disposing of large quantities of
   organic by-products and poultry litter on agricultural land. Our
   objectives were to evaluate the effects of applying noncomposted
   municipal solid waste (MSW), amended with either poultry litter (PL) or
   NH4NO3 to adjust C:N ratios in the soil surface in either the spring or
   fall. Changes in soil chemical properties, bacteria population shifts,
   changes in species richness and evenness of indigenous soil bacteria,
   and response by cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) were evaluated. Soil P,
   K, Ca, and Mg were increased in the surface 0-15 cm by a factor of three
   or four times by application of organic by-products. After two annual
   applications, soil Cu increased slightly, Zn doubled, Co and Cr
   decreased, while Pb increased by a factor of two. Soil organic matter
   content increased on average by 89 percent for treatments containing
   newsprint, yard trimmings, and cotton gin trash. Newsprint plus NH4NO3
   resulted in a shift to more Gram positive bacteria, while newsprint plus
   poultry Litter resulted in a shift to more Gram negative bacteria. Both
   N sources resulted in a reduction in Bacillus sp. Shifts in the
   bacterial populations and changes in species richness (number of species
   detected) and evenness (relative abundance of each species) were induced
   by organic by-product additions. These shifts appear to be the result of
   increased substrate for C mineralization rather than any properties of
   biological control. Shifts in the microbial community structure towards
   Gram negative organisms may benefit plant growth and may be useful as an
   indicator of soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of soluble and bound phenolic compounds were measured in
   needles of 3-yr-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) trees exposed from
   May to November 1993 to a range of ozone (O-3) concentrations in
   open-top field chambers. The treatments were charcoal-filtered air (CF),
   non-filtered air (NF), and NF air with O, added at 1.5 times (NF 1.5)
   and 2.0 times (NF 2.0) the ambient O-3 concentration for 12 h daily.
   Average daily (0800-2000 hours) O-3 concentrations in the CF, NF, NF 1.5
   and NF 2.0 treatments were c. 29, 47, 76 and 98 nl l(-1), respectively,
   for the 140 d treatment period. At the end of the treatment period,
   total phenolic and proanthocyanidin concentrations in the previous
   year's needles were 25-29\% higher in the NF 2.0 treatment compared with
   the lower O-3 treatments. Catechin concentration increased in the
   previous pear's needles by as much as 81\% between the NF 2.0 treatment
   and the lower O-3 treatments. Catechin is an effective antioxidant, and
   elevated levels might confer some protection against O-3 injury. No
   significant differences in total phenolics and proanthocyanidins in the
   previous pear's needles were detected among the remaining O-3
   treatments, or among any O, treatment for the current year's needles.
   Lignin content in needles of both years was not significantly affected
   by O-3 exposure. Changes in the phenolic content of older needles in
   response to elevated O, could alter plant-pathogen interactions and slow
   down microbial decomposition, which could contribute to a decline in
   site soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of meaningful physical indicators of soil quality is
   an important part of characterizing the present state of our soil
   resources, A study was undertaken with the main objective of examining
   the compressive behavior of remolded (saturated only) and structurally
   intact (variable degrees of saturation including saturated) solum
   horizons sampled from an agricultural region in southwestern Ontario,
   Canada. The measured compression lines for the majority of soils showed
   significant convergence as C-c, the slope of the virgin compression line
   (VCL), increased with initial void ratio (e(0)) and preconsolidation
   stress (sigma(c)), The degree of saturation affected C-c mostly through
   its influence on sigma(c). Strength gain with progressive desorption was
   most apparent in nonplastic soils with more than a minimum content of
   structure stabilizing substances (transient strengthening) and in
   plastic soils with higher e(0) values. The widely adopted compaction
   paradigm derived from compression of sieved aggregates (i,e., constant
   C-c and VCL displacement to higher void ratios for a given stress with
   progressive desorption) was found to hold only for soils with relatively
   uniform eo and weaker grades of structure. Samples identified as highly
   overconsolidated (mostly subsoils) had their measured VCL displaced
   below the normal compression line (NCL) at sigma(c), which occurred when
   the void ratio difference between the NCL at unit stress and e(0)
   exceeded approximate to 0.36, Factors contributing to subsoil
   overconsolidation were believed to be mostly natural, including
   secondary compression and soil dessication. A pedotransfer function
   based on VCL reconstruction and sigma(c) estimation is proposed for
   assessing the degree of overconsolidation in agricultural soils located
   in this part of Ontario.}},

Abstract = {{A series of soil survey interpretive procedures, or pedotransfer
   functions (PTFs), are presented that follow from the hypothesis
   corroborated in the companion paper that the saturated compressive
   behavior of structured and of corresponding remolded agricultural soils
   in southern Ontario were strongly related. The three PTFs were useful in
   characterizing the degree of overconsolidation as a physical indicator
   of soil quality on a regional basis. PTF1 identified soils as being
   highly overconsolidated when the void ratio difference between the
   normal compression Line (NCL) at unit stress and e(0) exceeded 0.36. The
   preconsolidation stress (sigma(c)') of a soil was estimated from the dry
   bulk density measured in situ and from other soil properties needed to
   estimate the NCL of remolded soils (PTF2) or the virgin compression line
   of structured soils (PTF3). The PTFs were tested on a data set comprised
   of soil horizons characterized in five county-level soil inventories
   that meet the minimum PTF data requirements and other defined criteria
   (n = 210). An PTFs showed that the degree of soil overconsolidation
   increased significantly (P < 0.0001) with depth and with increasing clay
   content. For PTF2; the mean estimated (T: for the Ap horizons (n = 47)
   was only 20 kPa due to the effect of repeated tillage and natural
   turbational processes. The untilled solum (B) horizons were found to be
   in a less consolidated condition than the C horizon subsoils (mean
   sigma(c)' = 97 and 138 kFa, respectively). This suggested that effective
   stresses from wheel traffic and tillage operations have generally been
   no greater than those originating from natural causes in this region,
   Many of the clay-rich subsoils were quite overconsolidated (mean
   sigma(c)' > 150 kPa), whereas the coarser textured soils appeared to be
   closer to a normally consolidated condition, PTF3 corroborated most of
   these findings.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of mulching or incorporating residues of dolichos (Lablab
   purpureus L.), sown in rotation with cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), in
   broad (1.5 m wide) beds on soil properties of a Vertisol were studied in
   Northern New South Wales, Australia, Soil was sampled from the 0-0.10 m
   (bed surface) and 0.20-0.30 m (below bed) depths of edges and centres of
   broad beds during January 1993. Soil properties measured were
   particulate, mineral-associated and total organic matter, dispersion
   index, plastic limit, geometric mean diameter (GMD) of soil aggregates
   formed after puddling and drying at 40 degrees C (soil reactivity), soil
   density, exchangeable cations and nitrate-N, Compared with mulching,
   incorporating dolichos residues resulted in a significantly lower
   dispersion index. Mulching also resulted in higher values of dispersion
   index below beds when compared with bed surfaces. Plastic limit at the
   centres of beds was significantly lower than that in the edges. Smallest
   GMD of soil aggregates occurred in the centre of mulched beds. Greatest
   soil compaction occurred at soil water contents less than or equal to
   0.15 m(3) Mg-1 below beds when dolichos residues were mulched. Where
   dolichos residues were incorporated, at soil water contents less than or
   equal to 0.10 m(3) Mg-1 compaction in the soil surface was lower in bed
   centres when compared with those at the edges of beds. Residue
   management had no significant effect on soil organic matter fractions,
   although coarse (2 mm-212 mu m), fine (212-53 mu m) and total soil
   organic matter contents on bed surfaces were greater than those below
   beds, and coarse particulate organic matter at the edges of beds was
   greater than that at the centres. Greatest exchangeable K, and lowest
   exchangeable Na and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) occurred where
   dolichos residues were incorporated. In comparison with mulching,
   exchangeable Mg was higher and exchangeable Ca lower below beds with
   residue incorporation. Nitrate-N on bed surfaces was higher than that
   below beds with mulching. Mulching improved only friability of surface
   soil in bed centres, whereas indices of soil physical and chemical
   fertility such as aggregate stability, exchangeable cations, ESP and
   soil compaction in both bed surfaces and below beds were improved by
   incorporating dolichos residues, Better soil quality can, therefore, be
   maintained at this site by incorporating rather than mulching residues
   of dolichos sown in rotation with cotton.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement and ecological assessment of soil quality or conversely
   soil degradation, is important in Russia. Thus, based on the analysis of
   current standards and scientific studies, we developed a set of
   representative soil quality (soil degradation) indicators to assess the
   physical, chemical, and biological degradation of soil for various
   anthropogenic uses of the land. We have provided a matrix of indicators
   for each of the three processes of degradation. The indicators are
   grouped into five stages of degradation: high quality (non-degraded),
   weakly degraded, moderately degraded, highly degraded, and very highly
   degraded. We have proposed a rate index as a final estimate of soil
   degradation. We provide examples of how to calculate the soil quality
   index (soil degradation) and how to interpret the index. Finally we
   suggest methods for displaying soil quality using soil survey maps and
   remote sensing procedures.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we seek to reconcile low farm-level substitution
   elasticity between nitrogen. fertilizer, and land, with larger
   industry-level values for the corn sector, This is accomplished with a
   micro-simulation model which identities twenty-three heterogeneous
   groups of corn Farmers based on survey data for Indiana. After
   controlling for soil quality, slope, crop rotation, and natural nitrogen
   sources, considerable variation in fertilizer application rates remains.
   Model simulations indicate that the estimated substitution elasticity at
   the state level (1.15) is consistent with very low farm-level
   substitutability. The difference is attributable to compositional
   changes in the wake of relative price shocks. These compositional
   effects are potentially very important but they are ignored in most

Abstract = {{Development of a method to assess and monitor soil quality is critical
   to soil resource management and policy formation. To be useful, a method
   for assessing soil quality must be able to integrate many different
   kinds of data, allow evaluation of soil quality based on alternative
   uses or definitions and estimate soil quality for unsampled locations.
   In the present study we used one such method, based on non-parametric
   geostatistics. We evaluated soil quality from the integration of six
   soil variables measured at 220 locations in an agricultural field in
   southeastern Washington State. We converted the continous data values
   for each soil variable at each location to a binary variable indicator
   transform based on thresholds. We then combined indicator transformed
   data for individual soil variables into a single integrative indicator
   of soil quality termed a multiple variable indicator transform (MVIT).
   We observed that soil chemical variables, pools of soil resources,
   populations of microorgansims, and soil enzymes covaried spatially
   across the landscape. These ensembles of soil variables were not
   randomly distributed, but rather were systematically patterned. Soil
   quality maps calculated by kriging showed that the joint probabilities
   of meeting specific MVIT selection were influenced by the critical
   threshold values used to transform each individual soil quality variable
   and the MVIT selection criteria. If MVIT criteria adequately reflect
   soil quality then the kriging can produce maps of the probabilty of a
   soil being of good or poor quality.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of nitrogen (N) fertilizers, especially anhydrous ammonia,
   on soil quality has been questioned frequently by proponents of organic
   farming and low input sustainable agriculture. A 10-yr experiment was
   conducted on an Orthic Dark Brown Chemozemic loam, at Scott,
   Saskatchewan, to examine the influence of urea and anhydrous ammonia, at
   rates of N up to 180 kg ha(-1), on yields of cereals and oilseeds. In
   the 10th yr, we sampled soil from the 0- to 7.5- and 7.5- to 15-cm
   depths of each treatment 3 d before and 6 and 26 d after fertilization
   to assess the impact of applied N on microbial populations and soil
   biochemical properties. The long-term residual effects of N
   fertilization on soil properties were evident prior to the 10th annual N
   application. The short-term effects were most pronounced 6 d after the
   10th N application. Generally, effects were greater in the 7.5- to 15-cm
   depth, where N was placed. The soil, which was already acidic (pH = 5.2
   in 0.01 M CaCl2), decreased in pH in proportion to N rate and more so
   for anhydrous ammonia than urea. Generally, fungal and bacterial
   populations (plate counts) were positively related to N rate and were
   greater in soil treated with anhydrous ammonia than in urea-treated
   soil. In contrast, the actinomycete population was inversely related to
   N rate and was less for anhydrous ammonia than for urea. Nitrifier
   counts were increased by low rates of N (added substrate) but were
   similar to the check at high N rates (high acidity). There were no
   significant effects of N treatment on denitrifiers or yeasts. In
   contrast to the plate count results, microbial biomass decreased with
   increasing rates of N and was lower for anhydrous ammonia than for urea.
   However, the authenticity of this response is questionable because the
   fumigation-incubation method of biomass determination is compromised
   under acid conditions. Carbon mineralization was unaffected but N
   mineralization and nitrification tended to decrease at the 180 kg N
   ha(-1) rate of anhydrous ammonia. Significant nitrification occurred at
   pH < 5.0 suggesting possible adaptation of nitrifiers in this acid soil.
   Wet aggregate stability (WAS) was unaffected by N treatments. We
   concluded that, if producers in the Dark Brown soil zone apply
   fertilizers at rates less than 90 kg N ha(-1), deterioration of soil
   quality should be minimal.}},

Abstract = {{Purely annual crop-based production systems have limited scope to be
   sustainable under upland conditions prone to infestation by Imperata
   cylindrica if animal or mechanical tillage is not available. Farmers who
   must rely on manual cultivation of grassland soils can achieve some
   success in suppressing Imperata for a number of years using intensive
   relay and intercropping systems that maintain a dense soil cover
   throughout the year, especially where leguminous cover crops are
   included in the crop cycle. However, labour investment increases and
   returns to labour tend to decrease in successive years as weed pressure
   intensifies and soil quality declines.
   Continuous crop production has been sustained in many Imperata-infested
   areas where farmers have access to animal or tractor draft power.
   Imperata control is not a major problem in such situations. Draft power
   drastically reduces the labour requirements in weed control. Sustained
   crop production is then dependent more solely upon soil fertility
   management. Mixed farming systems that include cattle may also benefit
   from manure application to the cropped area, and the use of non-cropped
   fallow areas for grazing. In extensive systems where Imperata
   infestation is tolerated, cassava or sugarcane are often the crops with
   the longest period of viable production as the land degrades.
   On sloping Imperata lands, conservation farming practices are necessary
   to sustain annual cropping. Pruned tree hedgerows have often been
   recommended for these situations. On soils that are not strongly acidic
   they may consistently improve yields. But labour is the scarcest
   resource on small farms and tree-pruning is usually too labour-intensive
   to be practical. Buffer strip systems that provide excellent soil
   conservation but minimize labour have proven much more popular with
   farmers. Prominent among these are natural vegetative strips, or strips
   of introduced fodder grasses.
   The value of Imperata to restore soil fertility is low, particularly
   compared with woody secondary growth or Compositae species such as
   Chromolaena odorata or Tithonia diversifolia. Therefore, fallow-rotation
   systems where farmers can intervene to shift the fallow vegetation
   toward such naturally-occurring species, or can manage introduced cover
   crop species such as Mucuna utilis cv. cochinchinensis, enable
   substantial gains in yields and sustainability. Tree fallows are used
   successfully to achieve sustained cropping by some upland communities. A
   variation of this is rotational hedgerow intercropping, where a period
   of cropping is followed by one or more years of tree growth to generate
   nutrient-rich biomass, rehabilitate the soil, and suppress Imperata.
   These options, which suit farmers in quite resource-poor situations,
   should receive more attention.}},

Year = {{1996}},

Pages = {{99-123}},
Abstract = {{This review explores the potential energy, soil, and water constraints
   on highly productive agricultural systems. It focuses on the process of
   agricultural intensification during the past 50 years, and it shows that
   multiple constraints-as opposed to a single constraint, such as
   energy-are needed to assess the future sustainability of intensive
   agricultural production. Recent studies documenting changes in total
   factor productivity based on long-term experimental trials and held
   surveys are discussed in detail. The results of these studies are
   worrisome; they indicate that degradation in soil quality and in the
   overall natural resource base may threaten the long-run viability of
   several of the world's most intensive agricultural systems. Other
   studies are reviewed that support a more optimistic view of resource
   availability and the ability of improved technology and management to
   overcome these physical constraints. However, the combined evidence
   suggests that the increase in agricultural prices required to induce the
   necessary changes in technology could be devastating to low-income
   households. Most of the world's poor consume more agricultural output
   than they produce, and they spend up to 80\% of their incomes on food.}},

Abstract = {{In 1982, Osaka Bay Phoenix Project was launched to operate waste
   disposal project on reclaimed land in sea areas in conjunction with port

   Standards are set up in compliance with relevant laws and regulations
   concerning the quality of waste accepted at disposal sites. Accordingly,
   only non-hazardous and safe waste is accepted, and combustible waste is
   incinerated while non-combustible waste is crushed prior to disposal.
   This paper outlines the Osaka Bay Phoenix Project, as well as the
   properties of reclaimed land, based on the results of soil exploration
   tests conducted at the controlled disposal zone of Amagasaki Offshore
   Disposal Site, which is in an advanced stage of formation after about 6
   years of landfilling.
   In sum, an almost uniform soil quality has been achieved despite the
   inclusion of diverse waste materials; as a whole, the reclaimed land is
   equivalent to loose alluvial sandy soil.}},

Abstract = {{Radionuclides accidentally released to the atmosphere in severe nuclear
   accidents can give rise to widespread radioactive contamination of land
   If no remedial action is taken, the contamination may constitute a
   long-term external radiation hazard. Similarly, agricultural and dairy
   produce from the contaminated land may be a source of internal
   radiation. A newly developed agricultural implement named the `skim and
   burial' plough has been built and tested and shown to be an effective
   countermeasure against both of these potential hazards but without the
   disadvantages of some other land reclamation methods. The new plough
   skims off a shallow layer of the contaminated top soil and buries it at
   a depth of about 45 cm without inverting the 5-45 cm horizon. The
   results are that radiation levels at the soil surface are greatly
   reduced the contamination becomes much less available for plant uptake
   and in most cases there is little or no effect on soil quality. The
   efficacy of the new plough has been demonstrated under particularly
   severe field conditions. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Limited}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between subsurface contaminant concentrations and

   undertaken to develop a simplified relationship between subsurface
   contaminant concentrations and indoor air concentrations. This
   relationship is intended for use as a screening tool to determine the
   relative significance of vapor transport and inhalation as an exposure
   scenario in the establishment of soil quality guidelines. The
   relationship was developed using a proprietary model to analyze the
   infiltration of subsurface vapors into buildings. A probabilistic
   analysis of the relationship, using a form of Monte Carlo simulation,
   was undertaken to estimate the dilution of contaminant concentrations
   between the source (soil gas) and point of exposure (indoor air). Using
   standardized values for certain parameters and generic distributions for
   key variables, probability distributions were generated for the dilution
   factor as a function of contaminant depth and soil type.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality is of basic importance for agriculture and quality of
   environment. An acute need exists for reliable criteria of soil quality
   as a part of the environment protection policy. A soil protection act
   has been prepared in the Federal Republic of Germany, which consists of
   physical and chemical criteria but not biological ones. It has been
   assumed that the soil biological characteristics could provide an early
   warning system indicating soil injury. In our research the amounts of
   microbial biomass and the number of several groups of microorganisms
   have been determined in soil samples taken from the long-term fertilised
   soil sires which differ in their anthropogenic load. The first site at
   Brezno (north-west Bohemia) represents highly polluted area. The average
   annual SO2 and flying dust concentrations exceeded 100 mu g SO2.m(-3)
   and 100 mu g dust in 1 m(3) air in 1985 to 1989. The second site was
   located in Praha-Ruzyne and represented a medium polluted area, in which
   the average annual SO2 and flying dust concentrations ranged between 50
   and 100 mu.m(-3). The third site, a relatively clean one at Lukavec
   (Bohemian-Moravian Highlands), has the average annual SO2 concentrations
   less than 30 mu g SO2.m(-3) and that of the flying dust ranges between
   20 and 40 mu g.m(-3). The field experiment at Brezno was established on
   mine spoil in 1979. Its prevalent aim is to compare various types of
   soil recultivation practices. For our purpose four experimental plots
   were selected. The first one (BI) was covered by 50 cm soil and received
   70 t.ha(-1) sewage sludge a year. The plot B2 had the same soil cover,
   but does not receive fertilisers. The plots B3 and B4 were covered by 25
   cm soil and received in addition 400 t.ha(-1) power plant ashes. They
   were or were not fertilised in the same way like B1 and B2,
   respectively. Long-term field experiments in Ruzyne and Lukavec were
   founded in 1955. in our experiments we used the control plots (Ru11 and
   Lu21) and two plots manure + NPK fertilised (Ru28 and Lu14). Soil
   samples were taken at all experimental sites five times during 1995.
   They were processed by sieving (2 mm mesh) and analysed fresh within 24
   hours. Long-term application of organic and mineral fertilisers
   increased the amount of microbial biomass in soil samples from all three
   localities. Due to the high variability probably caused by seasonal
   dynamics, the average differences obtained were not statistically
   significant. Significant differences in this respect were found between
   different soil sites only. Total numbers of proteolytic microorganisms,
   spore-forming microorganisms and cellulolytic bacteria were not
   significantly different in fertilised and unfertilised soils. However,
   the results indicated substantial differences among different soil sites
   again. The most sensitive indicator of the anthropogenic soil load
   appeared to be the free-living diazotrophic bacteria. Their numbers were
   two to three orders of magnitude lower in the soil samples from polluted
   sites than in those from control plots. On the other hand the numbers of
   actinomycetes, particularly of cellulolytic ones and of oligotrophic
   bacteria were enhanced in soil samples from anthropogenically polluted
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{This paper follows up the previous one (M i k a n o v a et al., 1996),
   in which the aim of the research has been described, and the soil sites
   involved have been characterised. In the same paper the results of the
   determination of microbial biomass and numbers of individual groups of
   microorganisms in soil of different quality have been described. Soil
   samples taken 5 times during 1995 were processed by sieving (2 mm mesh)
   and analysed. For respiration measurements, portions of 75 g of fresh
   soil samples were put into flasks containing 25 ml or 50 ml 0.1N NaOH.
   Three replicates were incubated for 27 to 35 days at 25 degrees C and
   CO2 production was determined titrimetrically from 8 to 10 times during
   the incubation period. In addition to the basal respiration, a reactive
   respiration was also measured in soil samples mixed with 0.3 g lucerne
   meal. At the end of incubation, soil samples were removed from the
   flasks, air dried at room temperature and the activity of dehydrogenases
   was determined by measuring the reduction of TTC. The average initial
   rate of the basal respiration was higher in soil samples from control
   plots with exception of the soil naturally containing higher amounts of
   not humified organic matter (site at Lukavec). The differences in
   respiration activity of soils from the individual localities were
   probably due to the different physical state of the soils tested. This
   may be true also for cumulative CO2 production calculated after 27 days.
   In order to elucidate whether the degradation and mineralization of
   plant organic matter in soils can be affected by the anthropogenic load,
   the long-term reactive respiration activity in soil samples was
   determined. The calculated values of analysis of variance has shown that
   there were no significant differences among individual variants in this
   respect. The same was true for the accounted degree of substrate
   mineralization. Only the activity of dehydrogenases differed
   significantly in soil samples from the individual localities. There were
   no measurable activities in fact, there was zero dehydrogenase in soil
   samples from the extremely polluted area (site at Brezno).}},

Abstract = {{By the contineous help of Prof. W. LANGNER the senior author became the
   possibility to work between 1961 to 1963 and 1968 and 1971 in the
   Institute of Silviculture of the Faculty of Forestry, Institute of
   Silviculture in the University of the Andes in Merida/Venezuela. Results
   of this stay are evident in the foundation of a section for seed science
   and forest genetics and scientifically amongst others in the vegetative
   propagation of Saqui-saqui by branch and stem sets and grafts, which
   flowered and bore fruits within mostly 1 to 2 years after plantation. As
   a consequence in various countries of the natural distribution of the
   species in question clonal gardens as genetic resources and seed
   orchards could be established preferably with branch and stem sets. The
   problemless planting and treatment of the species in plantations made
   both - the clonal gardens and seed orchards - to a large field of
   flowering research in Colombia and Venezuela and to an important
   fountain of seed production for large scale plantations of about 10 000
   ha especially in Colombia and Costa Rica.
   First crosses and open pollinated progenies (table 1) made in Venezuela
   between 1968 and 1971 were cultivated in the institute's nursery in El
   Irel, and established as progeny test in Fl Caimital, the University's
   experimental forest, Barinas state in 1970. That is a site in the
   Eastern Llanos near the Yuca River with a pronounced dry period between
   November and March (min. January/February), a precipitation of 1500 mm
   (max. June/August) and an annual mean temperature of 26 degrees C.
   According to HOLDRIDGE Fl Caimital is a tropical dry forest. Eighty to
   135 species/ha, an abundant number of palm trees of only a few species
   are growing in this forest of gallery. According to the grade of
   exploitation it is a secondary forest with few precious species as
   Mahagony and Saqui-saqui. The soils of the 3 test sites are sandy to
   clay differentiated in higher and lower parts of the ground, the
   `'bancos'' and `'bajios'', and sporadic inundation for hours or days.
   The better test site seemed to be the river side (''agrobancor''),
   followed by the `'banco arenoso'' and the `'banco negro'' with higher
   content of clay and the longer inundations.
   The seedlings were planted in June/July 1970 during the raining season
   without any fertilization but the refined soil of each of the holes of
   40 cm of depth and 30 cm x 30 cm of width. The distance between plants
   were 3.5 m x 2.5 m (banco arenoso, banco negro) and 5 m x 5 m
   (agrobanco) respectively. The design were disbalanced complete
   randomized blacks with plots of 4 plants. Between 1970 to 1982 the trial
   was cleaned 2 times a year by machete and after that time sporadically
   within the rows till 1995. In 1996 the trial was completely cleaned from
   weed, climbers and other tree species. No thinning took place within 26
   years.
   The properties measured and assessed were total height and survival
   between 1970 to 1982 and circumferences when the trees had a height of
   more than 2 meters. In the age of 12 years additionally the straightness
   of the bole, the bifurcation and the specific weight of wood and in the
   age of 26 years the above mentioned properties, the length of the
   comercial bole and others were taken. For processing in a microcomputer
   the packet SAS was used. The commercial volume of the boles was
   calculated by the official formula of the proper ministry.
   Results of economic importance are presented and discussed. The survival
   of the 8 common progenies in all 3 sites is summarized in table 2. As
   shown the agrobanco near the Yuca river exceeds the other sites
   numerically considerably. That is true also for all the parameters of
   growth. The reasons for it are seen in the neighbourhood of the river
   with a high level of water in the subsoil also during the dry season,
   better soil quality in this site, missing inundations of more than a few
   hours and less competition by a larger planting distance. The trees of
   the row of isolation of the agrobanco surpass in growth properties all
   the other sites considerably (Table 2) which indicates for future
   plantations the need of larger planting distances and/or thinning in an
   early age.
   There exists significant variation between progenies in respect to
   survival, the length of commercial boles and as a consequence of the
   comercial volume. Progenies are varying with the replicate showing the
   heterogenity of the site and with the site in relation to survival but
   in no one of the growth properties (Table 3, 4).
   A mean of 80 \% caracterizes the quality of straigth stems in all trial
   sites; especially the banco arenoso with a mean soil quality and the
   progenies 1, 4, 13 and 25 showed a very high number of straigth boles
   (Fig. 1).
   The specific weigth of the wood of Saqui-saqui is of about 0.30 g/cm(3)
   (Table 6) after 12 years of planting and did not show any relation
   neither to the site nor to a particular progeny. Compared with other
   results from Venezuela, Colombia and Costa Rica of about 0.40 it is
   rather low. But there is variation of the specific weight with the
   heigth of the bole and with the age in other results of research. It is
   therefore a need to intensify the research on the important physical and
   mechanical wood properties of the species in question.
   Correlations in relation to the specific weight and total height of the
   stems in an age of 12 years were statistically significant; as shown
   (Table 5) they are more strictly for the sites of less soil quality and
   less height growth which is indicated also by the correlations between
   circumference and specific weight. It only reaches a significant level
   on the banco negro the site with the lesser soil quality.
   Beside of thinning as applied in Costa Rica the productivity of
   Saqui-saqui can be improved by the selection of corresponding sites
   (Table 2, 3) and the selection of better growing progenies indicated by
   a significant progeny x site interaction (Table 3, Fig. 2). Especially
   families with the clone 4.68 (Table i) as parent showed a good growth
   (and survival) in all crosses. This clone is highly autocompatible and
   did not result in any deficiency of in-breeding; therefore it might be
   prefered for the seed production in seed orchards and artificial crosses
   together with others of a simultaneous flowering behaviour.
   To shorten the breeding time of Saqui-saqui juvenile/adult-(8/26 years-)
   correlations were calculated for some important growth properties. Their
   significance at a high level (Table 7) permits an early selection
   allready in an juvenile stage on sites of a mean to a good soil quality
   as presented by the agrobanco and banco arenoso. In base of this result
   an early selection on soils of less quality than the mentioned above
   seems not possible.}},

Abstract = {{Sampling and analysis of subsurface contaminants comprise the first
   steps toward environmental remediation of hazardous spills. We have
   developed software tools to support the analysis phase, using three
   different schemes for interpolating scattered 3D soil-quality data onto
   a grid suitable for viewing in an interactive visualization system. A
   good interpolation scheme is one that respects the distribution of the
   original data. We find that the original data can be decimated by up to
   seventy percent while exhibiting graceful degradation in quality. A
   prototype software system is being deployed to allow technicians to
   visually determine, while in the field with their monitoring equipment,
   where the highest concentrations of contaminants lie. The system is now
   in use by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanisms of allele frequency distribution of the Sod S locus, which
   controls isozymes of root superoxide dismutase, were studied in spring
   barley varieties grown in the former USSR. Uneven distribution of Sod S1
   and Sod S2 alleles in different agroclimatic zones covering the entire
   territory of the former USSR was discovered. On the whole, the Sod S1
   allele occurs more frequently. The frequency of the Sod S2 allele
   decreases from north to south; at its extremes, it is 31.8 and 10.7\%,
   respectively. From west to east, the Sod S2 frequency increases from
   12.1\% (Western Ukraine) to 50.0\% (Eastern Siberia - the Far East). The
   variation in frequencies, discovered in this work, is consistent with
   physiological experiments and estimates of allele frequencies in winter
   barleys obtained earlier. Allele frequency distribution probably is
   determined by two main factors: (1) temperature conditions in the zone
   of roots and (2) soil quality characteristics. In old spring barley
   varieties, Sod S2 occurs more frequently than in new varieties. Until
   the middle of the 1900s, the frequency of this allele exceeded one-third
   among cultivated varieties. Beginning in the 1950s and continuing to the
   present time, the frequency of this allele has decreased two-fold in
   newly zoned varieties. Taking into account the importance of this enzyme
   for a plant species, the mechanisms of zonal distribution of the
   revealed alleles, and physiological experiments conducted in the
   Breeding and Genetics Institute, we assume that the Sod S2 allele
   controls barley tolerance to acid and saline soils.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding soil erosion processes is essential in appreciating the
   extent and causes of soil erosion and in planning soil conservation. A
   comprehensive study was conducted on steep slopes on the east coast of
   Peninsular Malaysia where the rainfall pattern is monsoonal. Rates of
   rainfall and runoff, and soil loss, were accurately measured from four
   large plots of 1000 m(2) and a bare plot of 20 m(2). Instruments used
   include Parshall flumes, height recorders, a pluviometer and a runoff
   tipping bucket recording on a datalogger, with the associated computer
   hardware and software for data processing and analysis. Because of the
   slope of the land (about 18\%) and the existence of large well-defined
   flow pathways, soil was largely eroded through the processes of
   entrainment and reentrainment. Soil loss and runoff were particularly
   high where the pathways were very pronounced. Other factors influencing
   soil erosion were disturbance to the soil surface, which produced easily
   entrainable material, and percent contact cover. The parameter beta,
   calculated for a large number of events, was found to vary according to
   the availability of entrainable material, There was a gradual general
   decrease of beta with time although most values were in the range 0.37
   to 0.25, Suspended load was commonly more than 50\% of total soil loss.
   Consequently, high chemical enrichment ratios were obtained. This has
   important implications on the reduction of soil quality through nutrient
   and organic matter losses.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term influence of N fertilizer, tillage and straw on crop
   production and soil properties are not well known in central Alberta.
   Field experiments were established in autumn 1979, on a Black Chemozemic
   soil and on a Gray Luvisolic soil in north-central Alberta to determine
   the long-term effect of tillage, straw and N fertilizer on yield and N
   uptake of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Fertilizer N was applied annually
   at 56 kg ha(-1). The 11 year averages of barley yields and N uptake
   under zero tillage were lower than under conventional tillage. Retention
   rather than removal of straw tended to reduce barley yield for the
   initial 6 years and 2 years at Site 1 and Site 2, respectively. A simple
   mathematical model of average annual plant N uptake and grain yield
   could account for most of the variation in the data observed at both
   sites (R(2)=0.907; P <0.01). Final values of soil N, calculated using a
   mass balance approach, agree closely with values measured at the end of
   the eleventh year. Conventional tillage and zero tillage, with addition
   of fertilizer N and retention of straw, were the only treatments with
   apparent but small net addition of N to soil at Site 1 (40 kg ha(-1) and
   117 kg ha(-1), respectively). At Site 2, only the zero tillage treatment
   with addition of fertilizer and retention of straw gained soil N (29 kg
   ha(-1)). In conclusion, soil ecosystems functioning in subhumid
   environments with slight to moderate heat limitations such as those in
   central Alberta can adapt, within a few years, to zero tillage practices
   with full retention of straw.}},

Abstract = {{Viewing soils in the full context of landscape ecology is imperative.
   Both land and its component soil resources are finite. The biological
   capability of the earth's ecosystems is limited, even though agriculture
   productivity has been manipulated by genetic selection of plants,
   adjusting nutrient flows, managing water, and controlling pests.
   However, these interventions also have serious economic and
   environmental repercussions. Increasing populations require more space,
   more food, more fuels and more of other resources. For soil scientists,
   the challenge is to (a) understand soil processes, (b) characterize and
   map soil resources,and (c) predict soil behavior under a variety of
   potential uses in the interest of providing society and its governing
   institutions with options and trade-offs in land use decisions. Global
   and regional economic and agricultural productivity will depend solely
   on our ability to increase productivity by (a) making
   economic-agricultural development congruent with ecological and
   social-political realities, (b) proper use and conservation of
   indigenous genetic resources, and (c) rehabilitating disturbed and
   degraded ecosystems. In this review, we assess these considerations and
   suggest needed strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted to determine the concentrations of a large number
   of industrial organic compounds in selected Canadian agricultural soils
   and to assess the potential for land application of municipal sludges to
   cause significant polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), organochlorine
   pesticide (OC) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination of
   agricultural land. Twenty-four Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Soil
   Quality Evaluation Program (SQEP) benchmark soils and six intensively
   cropped southern Ontario soils exhibited similar small concentrations of
   a few base-neutral and acid (BN\&A) extractable industrial organic
   compounds (seldom >1 mg kg(-1) dry wt), PCBs (<200 mu g kg(-1) dry wt)
   and organophosphorus pesticides (OPs). Fonofos, the only OP detected,
   was observed at concentrations <100 mu g kg(-1) dry wt. Neutral and
   phenoxy acid herbicide analyses for 13 soils (seven SQEP and six
   intensively cropped) indicated infrequent detection of these compounds.
   There was no detection of carbamate herbicides. In most soils, only
   trace amounts (<10 mu g kg(-1) dry wt) of OCs were observed but in one
   intensively cropped soil, DDT exceeded 70 mg kg(-1) dw. A greater
   incidence of compounds such as alpha chlordane, dieldrin, aldrin and DDT
   in intensively cropped than in other soils is assumed to reflect
   increased use of these compounds for intensive crop production. Soils
   treated with sludge according to recommended practice exhibited minor
   increases in PAH, OC and PCB concentrations. There is no risk to human
   health or the environment from industrial organic compounds, except
   possibly DDT, in Canadian agricultural soils that have received no
   sludge or from PAHs, OCs and PCBs in soils that have received southern
   Ontario sludges according to recommended practice.}},

Abstract = {{In an integrated, multidisciplinary study we compared ecological
   characteristics and productivity of commercial farms categorized as
   either organic (ORG) or conventional (CNV) based on their use of
   synthetic fertilizers and pesticides or reliance on organic soil
   amendments and biological pest control. We measured belowground
   parameters: various soil chemical and biological properties and root
   disease severity; common agronomic indicators: biomass, fruit yield and
   insect pest damage; and community level indicators, including arthropod
   diversity and soil microbial activity and diversity. CNV and ORG
   production systems could not be distinguished based on agronomic
   criteria such as fruit yield and arthropod pest damage levels. However,
   differences were demonstrated in many soil, plant, disease, and
   diversity indicators suggesting that the ecological processes
   determining yields and pest levels in these two management systems are
   distinct. In particular, nitrogen mineralization potential and microbial
   and parasitoid abundance and diversity were higher in ORG farms.
   Differences between the agroecosystems were sufficiently robust to be
   distinguished from environmental variation and suggest that biological
   processes compensated for reductions in the use of synthetic fertilizers
   and pesticides.}},

Abstract = {{An exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) >15 is traditionally considered
   to affect soil structural and hydraulic characteristics. Recent
   investigations show that both this critical value and the concept of
   critical threshold need reconsideration, because soil degradation often
   takes place even at lower ESP in dilute solutions, and soil behavior at
   increasing ESP appears to be a continuum. This study was carried out to
   analyze the response of two Sicilian Typic Haploxererts to ESP values up
   to 15, at a low cationic concentration. The investigation was carried
   out on aggregate stability, rating of soil shrink-swell potential, and
   both saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. The specific
   purpose was to verify if a critical ESP threshold exists, or if the
   hypothesis of a continuum behavior is more appropriate. The high-energy
   moisture characteristic technique was used for determining aggregate
   stability, and Brasher's method for the shrinkage characteristic. The
   constant-head method was used for determining saturated hydraulic
   conductivity, and the parameter estimation method based on one-step
   outflow experiments for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Almost
   linear relationships were found between the investigated soil properties
   and ESP, indicating no critical ESP threshold; furthermore, the results
   obtained indicate that an effective hazard of soil quality degradation
   can be forecast even in a 2 to 5 ESP range at a low cationic
   concentration. This is a basic indication for irrigation management
   aimed to combat and prevent degradation of soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of eight crop rotations was studied for 3 years (1990-92) on
   enzyme activities, nitrifying bacteria, VAM spores, organic matter,
   NO3-N and available-P, on loamy-sand soil under desert conditions.
   Inclusion of the legume crops, clusterbean or mung bean in the rotation
   had a beneficial effect on these parameters over fallow-pearl millet,
   resulting in a significant increase in pearl millet production.
   Continuous clusterbean for 3 years in rotation gave the maximum increase
   in soil organic matter, NO3-N, available P and enzyme activities
   (dehydrogenase, acid and alkaline phosphatases, nitrogenase) over
   continuous pearl millet while the trend was reversed for the nitrifying
   bacteria and VAM spores population. In general, the effect on soil
   biochemical properties was greater in surface soil (0-15 cm) than
   subsoil. However, the build up of VAM spores was greater in subsoil.
   The results demonstrate that in arid sandy soils, in order to improve
   soil quality, legumes, particularly clusterbean, should appear for more
   than 1 year successively in legume-cereal rotations. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{Farmer perception of the dangers of soil erosion is increasingly
   recognized as having a rational basis, Little independent corroboration
   exists, however, that farmer behaviour accords with the technical
   efficiency and cost effectiveness of soil and water conservation
   measures, Accordingly, at three field sites in semiarid Kenya, five
   conservation treatments - bench terraces (fanya juu), tied ridging,
   contour tillage, trashlines and a control treatment (hand tillage) -
   were assessed for their performance and compared with farmers' views of
   the need for conservation and their actual adoption of soil and water
   conservation measures, Experimentally in terms of differential maize
   yields, trashlines were found to be the single most effective measure
   for most (but not ail) circumstances, Analyses of marginal rates of
   return and net present values over ten years indicated tied ridging and
   terracing also to be worthwhile but only under specific circumstances of
   soil quality and labour availability, A questionnaire survey in the
   three trial areas revealed that farmers' opinions and rate of adoption
   of techniques closely match the conclusions from the experimental plots,
   Small farmer behaviour is rational in this marginal and difficult
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{We study economic and environmental aspects of farming practices of a
   sample of 91 family farms around the city of Ouro Preto, in Brazil's
   state of Rondonia, in western Amazonia, from four overlapping
   perspectives. First, we estimate production functions for six activities
   on multiproduct farms, finding evidence of increasing returns to scale
   in cattle activity and possible evidence of nonindependence of profit
   and utility maximization in several subsistence crops. Second, we
   examine determinants of overall current farm revenue and wealth, finding
   possible evidence of overuse of land and underinvestment in cattle,
   decapitalization of farms over time, overpopulation, and a trade-off
   between children and capital accumulation. Third, we study interactions
   between burning strategies, diversification: of farm activities,
   locational choice, length of tenure on a farm, and soil quality. Longer
   tenure on a farm and larger area in perennial crops appear to reduce the
   frequency of burning, while greater area in annual crops increases the
   frequency. Larger pasture area tends to reduce the frequency of burning
   below an annual periodicity. Less frequent burning appears to be
   accompanied by greater diversification of farm income sources. Fourth,
   we study the determinants of deforestation on lots, finding a negative
   effect of clearance costs study and productivity of land in cultivation
   on the clearance of new land. However, the evidence for the relationship
   between cattle activity and deforestation is mixed: a larger number of
   cattle increases the absolute amount of land deforested on a lot, but a
   higher proportion of income from cattle increases the ratio of
   cultivated land to pasture on a farm. There is also evidence of a
   trade-off between land quality and the quantity of land deforested.}},

Abstract = {{Fallow-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping systems may be responsible
   for declines in soil organic matter and degradation of soil physical
   properties. A change to annual cropping may improve or at least maintain
   soil properties. Tillage and crop sequence effects on soil properties
   and water infiltration were tested after 9 yr of cropping on a Dooley
   sandy loam (fine-loamy, mixed Typic Argiborolls) derived in glacial
   till. Annual cropping tillage of fall sweep and spring disk (AWFST), and
   no tillage (AWNT) were compared with conventional tillage in
   wheat-fallow (FWCT) as the control. Statistical design was a randomized
   complete block with four replications, Soil samples were taken at 0.03-m
   increments to a depth of 0.3 m and were used to measure organic carbon
   (OC), pH, bulk density (BD), and particle size. Point resistance was
   measured in 0.02-m increments, Water infiltration into dry and wet soil
   was measured using a rainfall simulator, Maximum soil BD was 1.61 Mg
   m(-3) on FWCT and 1.56 Mg m(-3) on AWNT. Soil BD was not changed by one
   winter of freezing and thawing. Maximum point resistance was 2.2 MPa on
   FWCT and 1.7 MPa on AWNT. Cumulative 3-h infiltration into dry soil was
   52 mm for FWCT and 69 mm for AWNT. Final infiltration rate into wet soil
   was 5 mm h(-1) for FWCT and 6 mm h(-1) for AWNT. There was a significant
   difference in the depth distribution of OC between annual crop and FWCT
   treatments. Mass of OC in the top 0.09 m of soil was 1.65 kg m(-2) on
   annual crop treatments and 1.45 kg m(-2) on FWCT, Greater amounts of OC
   on the annual crop treatments compared with the FWCT attest to the
   beneficial aspect of annual cropping in maintaining a level of soil
   quality that is greater than FWCT. From a soil conservation perspective,
   no-tillage has an additional advantage because surface cover is
   maintained throughout the year, thereby reducing the potential for soil
   erosion.}},

Abstract = {{Cleanup of contaminated soils to comply with soil quality limits
   currently receives much interest. In-situ remediation of contaminated
   soils relies on the ability of the techniques employed to enhance the
   rate of release of contaminants from the soil-sorbed and nonaqueous
   phase liquid (NAPL) phases into the aqueous or gaseous phases from which
   they can be more readily removed and treated. Contaminant concentrations
   in these ``environmentally mobile{''} forms usually decline over time so
   that the economic efficiency and the overall success of remediation
   technologies are subject to the ``law of diminishing returns{''}. In
   this paper we consider the ``state of the art{''} in our understanding
   of NAPL dissolution and transport, desorption of soil-sorbed
   contaminants and fluid flow in porous media. The extent to which these
   processes may constrain the success of bioremediation, pump-and-treat
   remediation and soil venting in relation to established soil quality
   limits is addressed. Finally, we suggest directions for future research
   and comment on legislative considerations.}},

Abstract = {{Oribatid mites are a group of arthropods that have had remarkable
   evolutionary success with regard to species richness, variety of
   habitats colonized, life-cycle variation and reproductive patterns. The
   aim of this paper is to review some of the important features of
   Oribatida in relation to the possible use of these animals in
   ecotoxicological experiments. Their often sedentary way of living,
   combined with a narrow dependence on microhabitats qualify oribatids as
   potential indicator organisms for air and soil quality. Some species
   have been shown to be extremely sensitive to air pollutants such as SO2
   and NO2. A low metabolic rate may be the driving force for slow
   development, low fertility, iteroparity and long adult life. Given these
   life-cycle characteristics, oribatids may be particularly vulnerable to
   intoxication by persistent contaminants. Work done on heavy metals
   suggests that the capacity for accumulation differs greatly between
   species. The camisiid Platynothrus peltifer accumulates high amounts of
   trace metals, specifically Mn. The toxicity of Cd, Cu and Pb has been
   studied in P. peltifer, demonstrating the necessity to consider egg
   production as a sensitive criterion. It is concluded that oribatid mites
   hold a great potential for use in ecotoxicology, due to the structural
   and functional complexity of their communities, and several
   peculiarities not found in other arthropods. The possibilities offered
   by this diverse group have not yet been fully employed by
   ecotoxicologists.}},

   preferences for more sophisticated information on soil water, plant
   growth and the weather. The maximum amount irrigation farmers with
   unlimited irrigation water supply on Hutton soil could pay for the
   highest level of information varied between R136/ha and R330/ha
   depending on their risk preferences. The value of information increased
   by al least 49\% when irrigation water became limited. It is clear that
   information is a partial substitute for soil quality in terms of

Abstract = {{Despite the wide-spread perception that the soils of southwestern
   Saskatchewan are particularly erosion prone, few observations have been
   made on soil loss in this area. We used Cs-137 redistribution to examine
   rates of soil loss associated with five parent-material groups in this
   area. Five sites were sampled in each parent-material group: one
   uncultivated site and four cultivated sites. Ten samples were taken at
   each site from landscape positions that have been shown in previous
   studies to have the highest rates of soil loss. The highest rates
   (median soil loss of -30 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) were associated with glacial
   till landscapes; medium (-21 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) but highly variable rates
   of loss, with coarse sandy glaciofluvial-lacustrine landscapes; and
   lower and consistent losses of around -12 t ha(-1) yr(-1), with silty
   glaciolacustrine and aeolian landscapes and with fine sandy
   glaciofluvial-lacustrine landscapes. The observed rates of loss can be
   used to calibrate models of geomorphic instability for this area.}},

Abstract = {{Crested wheatgrass and Russian wildrye are used extensively as seeded
   pastures in the prairie region of western Canada, Their long-term impact
   on soil quality was studied at 4 sites, each including plant communities
   of native mixed prairie rangeland and 17- to 27-year-old monocultures of
   crested wheatgrass and Russian wildrye, in southern Alberta, Canada,
   Root mass and soil chemical properties were determined on the soil
   samples collected, Native rangeland had about 7.6 times more root mass
   than the seeded species from the 0- to 7.5-cm depth and about equivalent
   mass from the 7.5- to 40-cm depth, For the seeded species, root mass was
   significantly less between rows than within rows, Soils in the native
   rangeland community had significantly greater soil organic matter and
   lower NO3-N, chemical index, urease activity, and available phosphorus
   than those in the seeded pastures, Altering the plant community from
   native mixed prairie to either a sequence of cropping followed by an
   introduced grass monoculture, or directly to an introduced grass
   monoculture, resulted in decreased root mass and organic matter, and
   monosaccharide content of dry aggregates, The seeded grasses could
   neither return nor maintain the chemical quality of the soils in
   relation to that of the native rangeland.}},

Abstract = {{Land managers, livestock producers, and the public are concerned about
   the effects of grazing on soil quality and sustainability of rangeland
   resources. Pastures at the High Plains Grasslands Research Station near
   Cheyenne, Wyoming grazed for the past II years at a heavy stocking rate
   (67 steer-days/ha) under three light grazing (22 steer-days/ha) and to
   livestock exclosures. The heavy stocking rate resulted in slightly less
   than 50\% utilization of the annual forage produced a level recommended
   by land management agencies. Prior to initiating this grazing research
   the rangeland had not been grazed for about 40 years. Soil organic
   carbon and nitrogen response were evaluated by collecting soil samples
   to 91 mt (36 in) depth. Soils had higher amounts of carbon and nitrogen
   in the surface 30 cm (12 in) on the grazed pastures compared to native
   rangeland where livestock were excluded. However, soil carbon and
   nitrogen below 30 mt was similar among all grazing treatments. Carbon
   and nitrogen dynamics were greatest in the surface 30 mt where more than
   three-fourths of the plant root biomass exists. Grazing strategies and
   stocking rates imposed for the past II years on this mixed grass prairie
   did not detrimentally affect soil organic carbon and nitrogen levels.
   The data in fact, suggest that responsible grazing enhanced the overall
   soil quality as assessed by these parameters.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed 22 physical biological and chemical soil properties using
   adjacent fields from commercial farms in New Zealand. Our objective runs
   to measure the effects of biodynamic, conventional and continuous grass
   systems on soil quality. One set of three adjacent farm fields included
   a biodynamic vegetable field, a conventional vegetable field, and a
   biodynamic pasture field. A second set of three adjacent farm fields
   included a biodynamic mixed (grain/sheep/beef) field, a conventional
   mixed field, and a biodynamic pasture field. The pasture fields had
   soils of higher biological quality (i.e., more organic matter microbial
   activity and earthworms) than the soils of the biodynamically or
   conventionally cropped fields. The biodynamic vegetable field had soil
   of higher physical biological and chemical quality than its conventional
   neighbor. When converting the chemical and biological data from a mass
   to a volume basis, most statistically significant differences remained
   in the vegetable/pasture data set, whereas many became nonsignificant in
   the mixed/pasture data set. Presenting data on a volume basis per unit
   given surface depth (like 0 to 10 cm in this study) may penalize a farm
   with lower bulk densities and thicker topsoils in comparison to an
   adjacent farm with higher bulk densities and thinner topsoils. We
   recommend calculating soil measurements an a volume basis per unit of
   topsoil depth (complete A horizon) or per unit of solum depth (A and B
   horizons). Whether data are presented on a mass or volume basis,
   biological or ecological significance should be emphasized rather than
   statistical significance.}},

Abstract = {{Whole organism bioassays for the assessment of soil, freshwater
   sediment, and freshwater quality were evaluated for their application in
   the assessment and remediation of contaminated sites in Canada under the
   National Contaminated Sites Remediation Program. Using 3 essential and
   12 desirable methodological criteria, bioassays were categorized as
   currently usable, prototype, or under development. Based on further
   considerations related to bioassay application, a battery of usable
   screening and definitive tests was recommended (with suggestions for
   augmentation) for each medium. Of the 18 bioassays reviewed for soil
   quality assessment, 6 were usable, 5 were prototypes, and 7 were under
   development. Battery screening and definitive tests included 14-day
   Eisenia andrei survival, 120-hr lettuce and radish seedling emergence,
   and 72-hr Selenastrum capricornutum growth inhibition. Augmentation with
   the following bioassays was recommended: soil/freshwater bacterial
   growth, arthropod reproduction, earthworm reproduction, and reproduction
   of other soil-dependent organisms. Of the 9 bioassays reviewed for
   freshwater sediment quality assessment, 1 was usable, 2 were prototypes,
   and 6 were under development. Three bioassays in the latter two groups
   were considered usable with the imminent completion of research
   underway. Screening tests selected included 10-day Chironomus tentans
   survival, 10-day Hyalella Aztec survival, 10-day Hexagenia spp.
   survival, and 72-hr S. capricornutum growth inhibition. Definitive tests
   included screening tests, substituting 28-day H. azteca sexual
   maturation for 10-day survival. Augmentation with the following
   bioassays was recommended: sediment/freshwater bacterial test, 28-day
   Tubifex tubifex reproduction, and rooted aquatic plant growth. Of the 25
   bioassays considered for freshwater quality assessment, 8 were usable, 7
   were prototypes, and 10 were under development. Screening tests selected
   included 72-hr S. capricornutum growth inhibition; 48-hr Daphnia sp.
   survival, and 5- and 15-min Photobacterium phosphoreum bioluminescence.
   Definitive tests included first screening test, 7-day Ceriodaphnia
   dubia, 7-day fathead minnow larval survival, or 96-hr rainbow trout
   survival. Augmentation with the following bioassays was recommended:
   Brachionus calyciflorus 24-hr survival, 48-hr reproduction; freshwater
   bacterial growth; and aquatic vascular plant growth. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{In agricultural ecosystems that have had consistent cropping histories,
   standard microbial methods may be used to evaluate past and present
   practices.  Our objective was to evaluate several microbial methods that
   best indicate cropping histories and soil quality on long-term plots. 
   We selected soil microbial carbon (C), phospholipid analyses, direct
   counts of total fungal and bacterial biomass, and soil enzymes
   (phosphatases) to measure direct and indirect microbial activity on the
   Sanborn Field and Tucker Prairie.  The Sanborn Field has been under
   various cropping and management practices since 1888 and the Tucker
   Prairie is an uncultivated site.  Seven different plots were chosen on
   the Sanborn Field and random samples were taken in the summit area on
   the Tucker Prairie, which represented a reference site.  Soil microbial
   biomass C, phospholipids, and enzyme activity were reflective of the
   cropping and management histories observed on the Sanborn Field. 
   Enzymatic activity was highly correlated to soil organic matter.  The
   direct counts of fungal and bacterial biomass showed that fungal
   populations dominated these soils, which may be attributed to soil pH. 
   Soil microbial biomass C and enzyme assays seemed to be better potential
   indicators of cropping histories than the other methods tested in the
   long-term plots.}},

Abstract = {{Many world ecosystems are in various states of decline evidenced by
   erosion, low productivity, and poor water quality caused by forest
   clearing, intensive agricultural production, and continued use of land
   resources for purposes that are not sustainable. The biological
   diversity of these systems is being altered. Little research has been
   conducted to quantify the beneficial relationships between microbial
   diversity, soil and plant quality, and ecosystem sustainability.
   Ecosystem functioning is governed largely by soil microbial dynamics.
   Differences in microbial properties and activities of soils have been
   reported but are restricted to general ecological enumeration methods or
   activity levels, which are limited in their ability to describe a
   particular ecosystem. Microbial populations and their responses to
   stresses have been traditionally studied at the process level, in terms
   of total numbers of microorganisms, biomass, respiration rates, and
   enzyme activities, with little attention being paid to responses at the
   community or the organismal levels. These process level measurements,
   although critical to understanding the ecosystem, may be insensitive to
   community level changes due to the redundancy of these functions. As
   microbial communities comprise complex interactions between diverse
   organisms, they should be studied as such, and not as a `'black box''
   into which inputs are entered and outputs are received at measured
   rates. Microbial communities and their processes need to be examined in
   relation to not only the individuals that comprise the community, but
   the effect of perturbations or environmental stresses on those
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{We present an analysis of local species richness in neotropical forests,
   based on a number of 0.1 ha samples of woody plants collected by the
   late Alwyn Gentry. For each of 69 forests, soils were analysed and
   climatic data were collated. Using transformed independent variables and
   interaction terms, multiple regression equations were developed that
   explained the greatest possible amount of variation in species richness,
   and the best equations were selected on the basis of regression
   diagnostics. The best models are presented for (a) all neotropical
   forests, (b) forests west of the Andes (transandean) and (c) east of the
   Andes (cisandean), and for various subsets based on elevation and annual
   rainfall. For the whole dataset, and for most subsets, annual rainfall
   and rainfall seasonality were the most important variables for
   explaining species richness. Soil variables were correlated with
   precipitation - drier forests have more nutrient-rich soils. After the
   inclusion of rainfall variables, available soil nutrient concentrations
   contributed little to explaining or accounting for additional variation
   in species numbers, indicating that tropical forest species richness is
   surprisingly independent of soil quality. The results are consistent
   with the hypothesis that plants in mature tropical forests may obtain
   nutrients through the process of direct cycling, in which mineral
   nutrients are extracted from litterfall before they enter the soil. The
   strong relationship between community species richness and rainfall
   patterns has implications for biodiversity conservation, Wet forests
   with an ample year-round moisture supply harbour the greatest number of
   woody plant species and should be a focus of conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Routine soil testing procedures that are rapid and accurate are needed
   to evaluate C and N mineralization in agricultural soils in order to
   determine soil quality and fertility. Laboratory methods were compared
   for their usefulness in determining soil microbial biomass and potential
   activity in a Weswood silty clay loam (fine, mixed, thermic Fluventic
   Ustochrept) subjected to longterm tillage, crop sequence, and
   N-fertilizer management practices. The methods included basal soil
   respiration, net N mineralization during a 10-day incubation, soil
   microbial biomass C with the chloroform fumigation - incubation
   technique with and without subtracting a control value, soil microbial
   biomass N with the chloroform fumigation-incubation technique,
   substrate-induced respiration, and arginine ammonification. All methods
   were highly correlated with each other and, therefore, appear to
   adequately reflect soil microbial biomass and potential activity under
   laboratory conditions. The longer incubation times used with the basal
   soil respiration, N mineralization, and microbial biomass C and N assays
   resulted in higher correlations and lower variation among replications
   compared to the shorter incubation times used with substrate-induced
   respiration and arginine ammonification. The relatively rapid procedural
   time (3 h) required for the latter two assays could make these methods
   more attractive for routine soil testing, although multiple assays on
   the same sample may be necessary because these methods are less precise
   than the incubation methods that require 10 days.}},

Abstract = {{Serious concerns exist about environmental and ecological degradation
   from modern agriculture.  In response, the US Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA) and the US Department of Agriculture have established
   cooperative research programs in the midwestern USA to evaluate effects
   of different landscape structures and farming practices on crop yield,
   movement of agrichemicals, water and soil quality, and biodiversity. 
   This paper develops the hierarchical approach for those efforts
   particularly in relation to wild plants and animals (invertebrates,
   birds, small mammals) in terrestrial habitats.  The importance of
   considering different levels of biological organization and types of
   agricultural stressors over a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales
   is developed and illustrated by studies from North America and Europe. 
   EPA studies of farmland wildlife in the Midwest are used to illustrate
   an application of the hierarchical approach.  Those efforts would be
   improved by more regionally specific information on effects for a
   greater variety of taxa and over a broader range of biological
   organization.  Metapopulation dynamics also need study.  More detailed
   studies are required to evaluate specific, alternative within-field
   management practices, land set-aside schemes, and habitat restoration or
   enhancement options.  Development and linkage of GIS and spatially
   explicit population models would help develop, evaluate and communicate
   future scenarios.  An opportunity exists in the Midwest programs to
   compare biological patterns at population, community and landscape
   levels with assessments of ecosystem processes over a hierarchy of
   spatio-temporal scales.  The potential also exists to develop future
   scenarios which integrate across ecological, socio-political and
   economic perspectives.  To accomplish this, a more inclusive and
   consultative approach is required.  Changes in existing institutional
   processes and frameworks are likely required to promote the broad,
   integrated, transdisciplinary approaches needed for more effective
   planning, research and management of agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{CCME Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines for mercury have been
   recommended or are under development for soil, water and sediments.
   These guidelines provide nationally consistent benchmarks for
   environmental quality across Canada and are intended as decision support
   tools in protecting and sustaining aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in
   Canada and the beneficial uses they support. A Canadian water quality
   guideline for protection of aquatic life was recommended in 1987 as 0.1

Abstract = {{One of the basic requirements for sustainable management of soils is to
   ensure that soil fertility is maintained in a productive state and
   conditions so as to enable the soil to continue to provide viable
   economic yields with minimum degradation of soil quality and quantity.
   The practice of supplying nitrogen to fruit trees from biological
   nitrogen fixation by pasture legumes in the understorey vegetation of
   orchards is a sustainable means of maintaining soil fertility.
   Quantitative field measurements of amounts of biomass production and
   biological nitrogen fixation by three different kinds of understorey
   vegetation in an organic apple orchard in Canterbury, New Zealand was
   conducted over a period of two years. Results obtained showed that
   understorey herbage biomass production varied from 8 to 12 t ha(-1) and
   biological nitrogen fixation varied from 118 to 126 kg N ha(-1) over the
   period of two years. Nitrogen fixation was significantly correlated with
   clover dry matter production. Results were affected by seasons and
   understorey management practices.}},

Title = {{KINETIC CONSTRAINTS ON THE LOSS OF ORGANIC-CHEMICALS FROM CONTAMINATED
   SOILS - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOIL-QUALITY LIMITS}},
Journal = {{CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Generic or site-specific soil-quality limits for organic contaminants
   have been adopted or proposed in various countries in an effort to
   control or assess contamination. The most comprehensive generic limits,
   established in the Netherlands, distinguish between background
   concentrations for naturally occurring substances and analytical
   detection limits for man-made organic compounds (target values) and
   threshold concentrations above which remediation may be necessary
   (intervention values). These are being employed to highlight
   contaminated sites that require treatment/remediation, ideally resulting
   in the reduction of the compounds of concern. These limits have been
   derived in a number of ways but are largely based on professional
   judgment, usually on information concerning pathways of human exposure,
   phytotoxicity, and ecotoxicological effects. Effective remediation of
   contaminated soils is frequently limited by the slow kinetics of
   contaminant loss from soils under prevailing environmental conditions.
   This is frequently underestimated, even though it may be of fundamental
   importance in determining the success of treatment/remediation with
   respect to the assigned quality limits. This is because loss of
   contaminants from soils is often biphasic, whereby a short period of
   rapid dissipation is followed by a longer period of contaminant release.
   Dissipation processes, including leaching and volatilization, exhibit
   similar behavior. The primary rate-limiting factors governing this
   behavior are postulated to be fundamental sorption/desorption
   mechanisms, including intraparticle diffusion, intrasorbent diffusion
   and chemisorption, which control the distribution of contaminant between
   the solid and aqueous or gaseous phases of sons and, hence, the supply
   of contaminant available to the various dissipation processes. In this
   article, we consider the relevance of biphasic desorption kinetics to
   existing soil-quality limits. We contend that the concentration of a
   given contaminant in a given soil when the `'residual'' phase of
   dissipation is reached represents an intrinsic kinetic constraint to the
   remediation of contaminated soil. Because of the effects of the primary
   rate-limiting mechanisms discussed above, it is unlikely that (in the
   absence of any engineering solution to the problem) any appreciable
   change in the contaminant concentration will occur over practical time
   scales under prevailing environmental conditions for a given soil. We
   define this contaminant concentration as a kinetically constrained soil
   quality limit (KCSQL) and apply it to selected examples of contaminant
   dissipation from the literature, including polychlorinated biphenyls,
   polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, industrial solvents, and pesticides
   in a range of soils. Finally, we examine the relationship between the
   derived KCSQLs and the Dutch `'cleanup'' values and soil-quality
   criteria adopted in other countries.}},

Abstract = {{A base line study into the environmental quality of soils in the rural
   areas of the province of Zeeland, the Netherlands, was performed. The
   polder-landscape in this area was developed in a complex history of
   floodings and land-reclamation Samples from 67 sites, at a density of
   roughly one per 25 km(2), were analyzed for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Ph
   and Zn in addition to a physicochemical characterization by pH(KCl), dry
   solids, organic matter, and clay content. At about 2/3 of the sites
   samples were taken at more than one depth. Fluoride and pesticides were
   determined in partly overlapping selections of 30 samples. Four land use
   classes were distinguished (arable land, grass land, orchards,
   uncultivated), and samples were labelled by region within the province.
   Data evaluation was aided by a recursive statistical approach, whereby
   statistical tests confirm and strengthen geochemical reasoning. Single-
   and multivariate statistics were used both as exploratory tools and as a
   measure of significance and relevance of conditions and processes. In
   general the environmental quality of the soils is satisfactory.
   Exceedence of the legal standards for natural background values at more
   than one site occurs for Cd, Cu, Hg and the pesticides DDT/DDE, dieldrin
   and HCH, at most by a factor of three. High levels of Hg appear related
   to arable land use; enhanced levels of Cu are found in orchards. High Cd
   levels primarily seem to follow a regional or geological pattern; yet, a
   relation with arable land use and clayey soils cannot be excluded.
   Pesticides are not detected in grass land, incidence is highest in
   orchards as well as in uncultivated areas. DDT levels appear to be
   generally inherited from the past. Variation in soil type as described
   by the macro physico-chemical characteristics is essential in explaining
   the variation in concentration level of the potential contaminants.
   Variations with depth also appear largely related to concurrent
   variation in soil properties. For As redox conditions and hydrological
   regime seem of importance, in addition to the geologic history. The
   influence of atmospheric input is inferred for Pb. The available data do
   not fully resolve the causes for the regional pattern that remains when
   the influences of soil type, geology, and land use have been taken into
   account. In addition to current concentration levels, the base line
   study offers general insight as to what degree variations in potential
   contaminants are of natural or anthropogenic origin. A succession of
   similar studies at suitable time intervals, each with a new selection of
   sampling sites, may constitute an evolving, flexible monitoring system.
   When putting up a monitoring system, authorities should weigh the
   advantages and disadvantages of a network composed of fixed sites
   against this alternative.}},

Pages = {{277-296}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses the influence of N resources (fertilizer, legume,
   soil) on sustainable agriculture in temperate/boreal ecosystems
   (exemplified by the Canadian prairies), and in the humid, subhumid and
   semi-arid tropic (exemplified by southeast Asia and central and south
   America). A sustainable agricultural system is one that is economically
   viable, provides safe, nutritious food, and. conserves or enhances the
   environment. Consequently, we discuss the impact of N on crop yields,
   nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), food quality, environmental quality and
   on socioeconomic factors. Considerably more long-term research has been
   conducted in the temperate regions, consequently this was where most
   information was available. However, the principles governing the
   behaviour of N are very similar in all ecosystems. It is mainly the
   rates of nutrient cycling and the socioeconomic constraints that differ.
   Legumes and N fertilizers, used in a responsible manner, will increase
   crop production, provide quality food, increase net returns, reduce risk
   of monetary loss, improve soil quality, and reduce N loss via leaching
   and gaseous means. The key to sustainable management of N is to
   synchronize N supply with N use by the crop. Because societies in most
   temperate ecosystems are more affluent they are better positioned to
   encourage adoption of management techniques that promote sustainability.
   In contrast, most producers in the tropics are, subsistence farmers;
   consequently, their immediate goal is economic survival, not
   preservation of the environment.}},

Title = {{THE ROLE OF RESIDUES MANAGEMENT IN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{51-78}},
Abstract = {{Crop residues returned to the soil can maintain or enhance soil quality
   and productivity through favorable effects on soil properties and
   life-support processes. In the U.S., crop residues produced by 19
   principal crops are estimated at 400 million Mg/yr, compared with 2952
   million Mg/yr produced in the world. Crop residues returned to the soil
   contribute to the maintenance of and an increase in soil organic carbon
   content and add plant nutrients and reduce fertilizer requirements.
   Total amount of principal nutrients in crop residues range from 40 to
   100 Kg/Mg. Consumption of fertilizers in 1991 was 116 million Mg of N, P
   and K in the world and 16 million Mg in the U.S. In comparison,
   nutrients (N + P + K) contained in crop residues amount to 9 million
   Mg/yr in the U.S, and 74 million Mg/yr in the world. Therefore, a
   considerable quantity of fertilizers can be saved by returning the
   residues produced to the soil.
   Residue management is also important in soil and water conservation.
   About 2.5 Mg/ha of crop residue applied as mulch can reduce soil loss by
   60\%. Water conservation is an equally important benefit of returning
   crop residue, especially for rainfed agriculture in arid and semi-arid
   regions. Water stored in the root zone increases with increasing amount
   of residue returned to the soil. There are also snow retention benefits
   of crop residue mulch.
   Fuel value is estimated at 18.6 x 10(9) J or 2 bbl of oil per Mg of crop
   residues. Total fuel value is estimated at 7 EJ/yr (1 EJ = Exa Joule = 1
   x 10(18) Joules) in the U.S, and 64 EJ/yr in the world. Management of
   crop residues can also be a useful strategy for sequestering carbon into
   the soil, and reducing emissions of radiatively-active gases into the
   atmosphere: About 1.5 Pg (1 Pg = 1 peta gram = 1 x 10(15) g) of carbon
   Is stored in the crop residues produced annually in the world.
   Crop residues influence agricultural sustainability by enhancing
   productivity. Productivity increases with residue returned are greater
   with low rates of fertilizers than with high or recommended rates.
   Generally there is a synergistic effect between residue returned and
   fertilizer use. Innovative cropping systems should be developed to
   produce the desired amount of crop residue for alternative uses and
   returning surplus to the soil. In this regard, cover crops and
   conservation tillage systems can play an important role in designing
   appropriate cropping/farming systems.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological risk of a chemical in the environment can be estimated as
   the probability that a randomly selected species is being exposed to a
   concentration greater than its no-effect-level for that chemical. 
   Models have been developed for calculating ecological risks for toxic
   contaminants in soil, based on the variation of sensitivities among soil
   invertebrates.  These models normally do not allow for changing
   environmental conditions, such as acidification, that influence
   bioavailability and hence toxicity.  In the present paper, an attempt is
   made to improve on this and to investigate theoretically the influence
   of changing bioavailability on the ecological risks of cadmium and lead
   in soil.  Relationships between soil pH and metal contents of earthworms
   have been taken from the literature and were used to adjust NOEC-values
   from toxicity experiments.  The analysis shows that present soil quality
   standards for cadmium and lead will be insufficient to protect the
   community of soil invertebrates at low pH.  With 85 mug/g for lead as
   the total concentration, the ecological risk may increase from 1.5\% at
   pH 6 to 77\% at pH 3.5.  Such a non-linear increase is not only due to
   speciation changes of the metal, but is also determined by the curvature
   of the inter-species sensitivity distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Behaviour of polychlorinated biphenyls in soil greatly depends on the
   soil quality. That is why five soil samples of very distinct soil
   characteristics, such as: content of organic carbon, amount of clay
   fraction, pH value and the value of sorption index, were chosen for
   vegetation trial aimed at monitoring the PCBs transport in the system
   soil-plant. Contamination of soil samples was done by technical mixture
   Delor-106, containing prevailingly higher chlorinated biphenyls. Spring
   kohlrabi was used as a plant material. After completing three-month
   experiment significant linear correlations between PCBs residue in sail
   and sorption capacity of soil or pH value was found out (Tab. IV). No
   correlation was ascertained between the percentage of clay fraction and
   Cox as basic components of soil sorption capacity and PCBs residue in
   soil. Positive linear correlation was found out between qualitative
   indicators of soil organic matter (percentage of carbon in humic acids,
   percentage of aromatic carbon in humic acids) and PCBs residue in soil.
   Based on these results it is assumed that in binding organic xenobiotics
   more important role is played by qualitative side than a total amount of
   organic matter in soil. Higher uptake of PCBs through the root system
   compared to above-ground biomass is evident from the data of
   concentrations of D-106 in kohlrabi (Tab. III). When an average initial
   concentration of PCBs was 0.5 mg/kg, what is a risk value in soil, the
   highest concentration found out in kohlrabi was 0.16 mg/kg.}},

Abstract = {{Many chemical and biological amendments are applied to shrimp ponds with
   the objective of improving water quality, soil quality, or both. A few
   amendments can correct specific conditions when properly used, e.g.,
   fertilizers, liming materials, coagulants, and algicides. Some
   amendments are potentially useful, but application techniques have not
   been developed, e.g., oxidizing agents and compounds for precipitating
   phosphorus. Other amendments are claimed to be effective, but neither
   logic nor research data support their use. Examples are zeolite,
   bactericides, and preparations of live bacteria or enzymes. Even for
   chemical amendments of proven effectiveness, there often are different
   forms of each amendment, and some forms are less effective than others.
   For example, there are many kinds of liming materials. Some liming
   materials may be 2-4 times as effective per unit weight as others, but
   the costs of liming materials are not proportional to their performance.
   Shrimp farmers seldom understand the chemistry and efficacy of
   amendments for improving soil and water quality. They often are mislead
   by advertising claims and have unreasonable expectations of potential
   benefits of treating ponds with various substances. Data on the
   composition and properties of amendments, reactions of amendments with
   water and soil, proper use, and probable influences of amendments on
   pond environmental conditions provided here will enhance the ability of
   shrimp farmers to select and use water and soil quality amendments.
   Application of this information can result in better shrimp pond
   management by encouraging the proper use of effective amendments and
   avoiding application of expensive, ineffective amendments.}},

Abstract = {{Composting of sewage sludge can enhance its quality and suitability for
   agricultural use. In this work the optimal conditions for composting
   sewage sludge of small domestic wastewater treatment plants in a
   rotating vessel with the aim of sanitary safety were investigated. An
   intensive control programme with regard to viruses, bacteria and
   parasites was carried out that showed that the hygienic quality was
   satisfactory.
   A second aspect was the investigation of a possible reduction of
   hazardous organic and inorganic pollutants. The amount of inorganic
   micropollutants was low and did not change based on inorganic content.
   Based on inorganic residues, losses of 15.7\% of the AOX and 25\% of the
   EOX could be found. Relatively high decreasing rates of detergent
   concentrations could be measured. Only 31.1\% of the original load of
   anionic detergents (measured as MBAS), 38.7\% of the cationic and 57.4\%
   of the non-ionic detergents could be detected in the end material. For
   PAH concentration reduction between 31.5\% of fluoranthene and 90.6\%
   benzo(a)pyrene can be reported. All values are based on the inorganic
   residues.
   The quality of the resulting compost showed in the plant test a growth
   rate which qualified the compost to be used to increase soil quality.

Abstract = {{From the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains, European soils are
   threatened by diffuse pollution from modem agriculture and increased
   atmospheric deposition. The vulnerability of the soil to diffuse
   pollution depends on]and cover, topsoil features, net precipitation,
   aquifer type, groundwater recharge and age. The elaboration of the
   various elements was realized by applying Geographical Information
   Systems (GISs). Precipitation and the actual evapotranspiration were
   estimated using meteorological data. The resulting net precipitation is
   discharged by groundwater recharge and surfacial runoff, with the
   division of net precipitation in groundwater recharge and surfacial flow
   following from climate and soil features. The average groundwater age
   was based on aquifer depth, porosity and the recharge. The
   vulnerabilities of the soil and groundwater were estimated by
   establishing a ranking of the combined risks of a diffuse contamination
   for the topsoil and for groundwater in aquifers. Nitrogen compounds in
   soils are caused mainly by manuring and fertilization of agricultural
   lands and atmospheric deposition. The varying doses of fertilizer and
   manure and the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen compounds were
   assessed for an actual situation. Only part of the applied doses leached
   into the soil. The leaching of nitrate to a level of 1 m below land
   surface was estimated by applying empirical relations derived from the
   northwest European experience, based on land use, features of the
   topsoil and net precipitation. The subsequent leaching to deeper strata
   and a further denitrification also depend on groundwater recharge and
   aquifer type. The average nitrate concentration in the various aquifers
   was assessed by estimating the nitrogen doses to European soils in the
   course of time in combination with the groundwater age. Results,
   attained using GIS and presented in the form of maps, show the leaching
   of nitrate concentrations to a level of 1 m below land surface and also
   the average concentration in the upper aquifer system.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiated an innovative
   ecological risk assessment program at the Milltown Reservoir-Clark Fork
   River Sediments Superfund Site in 1989. The site is located in the Clark
   Fork River (CFR) basin of western Montana, and consists of 160 km (100
   miles) of the CFR. and an 820-acre wetland at Milltown Reservoir. The
   focus of the assessment was to identify chronic risks to ecological
   receptors from metals-contaminated sediments that have deposited in
   aquatic and terrestrial habitats of the site. Lack of established
   sediment or soil quality criteria, the extent of habitats within the
   watershed, and anticipated complex sediment and soil chemistry led to a
   unique laboratory and field-based approach for the baseline risk
   assessment. Study tasks evaluated aquatic, wetland, and terrestrial
   habitats across multiple trophic levels. The risk assessment integrated
   the results of these studies as a triad of chemical, toxicological, and
   ecological information. The comprehensive nature of the risk assessment
   was designed to help determine a remedial action for the wetland
   operable unit and set the basis for additional studies in the upper
   Clark Fork River watershed. As the problem formulation step in the EPA's
   risk assessment methodology, this article describes the background of
   the site, the approach and conceptual model for the risk assessment, and
   the planning process for implementing the various field and laboratory
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative assessments of the impact of agricultural practises on soil
   quality have been hindered by the lack of basic spatial units for
   designing landscape-scale research projects. This paper builds on the
   relationship which has been demonstrated to exist between small (5 m by
   5 m) slope segments and soil distribution in order to define larger
   landform element complexes in till landscapes of southern Saskatchewan,
   Canada. Distinctive pedogenic regimes are associated with these
   complexes. These complexes were then used to stratify the landscape at
   four conterminous sites with different cultivation histories and to
   assess changes in indicators of soil quality. Soil redistribution (as
   assessed by Cs-137 redistribution) has had a major impact on these
   landscapes. The shoulder and level summit complexes have experienced
   continued high rates of soil loss. The shoulder complexes have lost 55\%
   of their original soil organic carbon (a loss of 64 mg ha(-1)) over 80
   years and 70\% of this loss is attributable to net soil export from
   these positions. The portions of the footslope complexes dominated by
   Orthic Black Chernozemic soils initially act as sediment deposition
   sites in the first 22 years of cultivation, but ultimately this soil is
   removed from these positions and a moderate decline in soil quality
   occurs. The Gleysolic-dominated portions of the footslopes and the level
   depressional complexes occupy 15\% of the landscape and are the major
   long-term sediment depositional sites; the biochemical indicators of
   soil quality (soil organic carbon and total soil nitrogen) show a major
   and beneficial increase in these positions.}},

Abstract = {{This research wets designed to test the following hypothesis: Among
   traditional (nonliterate and minimally literate) people residing in
   their home environment, traditionally derived knowledge of specific
   cases of ecological processes can approximate scientifically derived
   knowledge of those same cases. After locating three minimally literate
   peasant family lineages in Lijiayang and Linfengkeng villages, Shouning
   County, Fujian Province, China, not applying science-based systems of
   agroforest management, a decision-free model of an indigenous agroforest
   management system was constructed from extensive interviews. The system
   was centered around shamu (Cunninghamia lanceolata), an important timber
   species with a long history of management in China. A major part of the
   management system is agricultural intercropping with a wide variety of
   cereal, cash, medicinal and oil-producing crops. Intercropping is
   practiced in the initial phases of afforestation; is an integral aspect
   of site preparation and the tending of the young stand; and contributes
   to tree establishment, growth, and survival. The cases presented
   demonstrate that local peasant knowledge of the effects of burning, site
   preparation crop selection, crop tending, and intercropping duration on
   soil quality and the survival and development of shamu is strongly
   analogous to the knowledge derived through systematic scientific
   research. This process of deriving scientifically valid ecological
   knowledge through traditional means is called proto-science.}},

   adoption of less pesticide-intensive methods in agriculture such as
   integrated pest management (IPM).  To investigate the effects of pest
   control inputs on yields and yield variability, data from a
   cross-section of San Joaquin Valley cotton producers were analyzed in a
   heteroskedastic production model.  The results suggest that yields are
   increasing with soil quality, crop rotation, frequency of field
   monitoring, and the use of independent pest control advisors.  Yield
   variability was not found to be significantly affected by production
   inputs, including pesticides and IPM practices with the exception of
   frequent contact with extension farm advisors which was found to
   contribute to reduced yield variability.}},

Abstract = {{Public interest in soil quality is increasing, but assessment is
   difficult because soil quality evaluations are often purpose- and
   site-specific. Our objective was to use a systems engineering
   methodology to evaluate soil quality with data collected following a
   long-term tillage study on continuous corn (Zea mays L.). Aggregate
   characteristics, penetration resistance, bulk density, volumetric water
   content, earthworm populations, respiration, microbial biomass,
   ergosterol concentrations, and several soil-test parameters (pH, P, K,
   Ca, Mg, Total-N, Total-C, NH4-N, and NO3-N) were measured on Orthic
   Luvisol soil samples collected from Rozetta and Palsgrove silt loam
   (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs) soils. Plots managed using
   no-till practices for 12 years before samples were collected for this
   study had surface soil aggregates that were more stable in water and had
   higher total carbon, microbial activity, ergosterol concentrations, and
   earthworm populations than either the chisel or plow treatments.
   Selected parameters were combined in the proposed soil quality index and
   gave ratings of 0.48, 0.49, or 0.68 for plow, chisel, or no-till
   treatments, respectively. This indicated that long-term no-till
   management had improved soil quality. The prediction was supported by
   using a sprinkler infiltration study to measure the amount of soil loss
   from plots that had been managed using no-till or moldboard plow
   tillage. We conclude that no-till practices on these soils can improve
   soil quality and that the systems engineering methodology may be useful
   for developing a more comprehensive soil quality index that includes
   factors such as pesticide and leaching potentials.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality is a composite measure of both a soil's ability to function
   and how well it functions, relative to a specific use. Soil quality can
   be assessed using a minimum data set comprising soil attributes such as
   texture, organic matter, pH, bulk density, and rooting depth. Soil
   organic matter has particular significance for soil quality as it can
   influence many different soil properties including other attributes of
   the minimum data set. Assessment of soil organic matter is a valuable
   step towards identifying the overall quality of a soil and may be so
   informative as to be included in minimum data sets used to evaluate the
   world's soils.
   In this review, soil organic matter is considered to encompass a set of
   attributes rather than being a single entity. Included among the
   attributes and discussed here are total soil organic carbon and
   nitrogen, light fraction and macroorganic (particulate) matter,
   mineralizable carbon and nitrogen, microbial biomass, soil carbohydrates
   and enzymes. These attributes are involved in various soil processes,
   such as those related to nutrient storage, biological activity, and soil
   structure, and can be used to establish different minimum data sets for
   the evaluation of soil organic matter quality.}},

Abstract = {{MANY tropical soils are poor in inorganic nutrients and rely on the
   recycling of nutrients from soil organic matter to maintain fertility.
   In undisturbed rainforests such nutrients are recycled via the
   litter(1); `slash-and-burn'agriculture, meanwhile, depends on the
   mineralization of organic nutrients from the plant remains(2,3) or on
   (short-lived) inputs from ash(4). This dependence on organic nutrients
   in tropical soils has the result that tests of soil quality which only
   give isolated measures of inorganic nutrient status are unreliable(5),
   and that the effects of fertilization can be inconsistent because of
   leaching or fixation of inorganic nutrients. Here we attempt to quantify
   the role of organic matter in sustaining the fertility of soils from
   three different climate zones. We estimate rates of carbon turnover from
   ecological measurements and C-14 dating. and determine its relation to
   the soil carbon and nutrient budgets. We find that agriculture without
   supplementary fertilization was economical for 65 years on temperate
   prairie and for sis years in a tropical semi-arid thorn forest. An
   extremely nutrient-poor Amazonian soil showed no potential for
   agriculture beyond the three-year lifespan of the forest litter mat,
   once biological nutrient cycles were interrupted by slash-burning. These
   observations suggest that quantification of organic-matter cycling may
   provide an important guide to the agricultural potential of soils.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing need to find a suitable means for disposal of
   coal combustion byproducts because of the increasing world-wide
   production of these byproducts.  This need has prompted interest in the
   use of land disposal, but there are concerns that this use may degrade
   the quality of soil.  To determine the influence of coal combustion
   byproducts on the transformation and fate of soil N and assess the
   potential impact of land disposal on soil quality, we studied the
   effects of two combustion byproducts (fly ash and bed ash) applied at
   rates of 22.5, 45, 90, and 180 Mg ha-1 on mineralization and volatile
   loss of N from soil.  Studies comparing the influence of the byproducts
   on these processes showed that whereas fly ash had little influence on
   the fate of soil N, bed ash caused substantial mineralization of organic
   soil N and volatile loss of this N as NH3.  Studies monitoring the pH of
   soils treated with bed ash showed that soil pH increased immediately
   after this treatment, with values reaching as high as 12.8.  These
   studies indicated that such extreme alkaline conditions caused chemical
   degradation and volatile loss of as much as 10\% of the organic N in
   soil, and they provide strong evidence that the improper disposal of bed
   ash on land can have a substantial negative impact on soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Cereals grown under irrigated conditions in the Canadian prairies
   produce large amounts of residues and proper management of these
   residues is required to produce good crop yields and maintain soil
   quality.  Field studies from 1986 to 1990 assessed the effect of
   straw-tillage treatments on plant growth of irrigated cereals on a Dark
   Brown Chernozemic Lethbridge (Typic Boroll) loam in southern Alberta. 
   The crop sequence was wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-wheat-oats (Avena
   sativa L.) wheat.  Straw was retained on the plots or removed by baling.
   Tillage treatments were autumn mouldboard ploughing, spring mouldboard
   ploughing or direct seeding.
   Grain yield was greater in the autumn plough compared with the spring
   plough treatments (4336 kg ha-1 vs. 3763 kg ha-1, respectively) in 1
   year (1989) out of 4.  Grain yield was greater in the no straw-spring
   plough than the straw-spring plough treatment (4242 kg ha-1 vs. 3791 kg
   ha-1, respectively) in 2 years out of 4.  Spring plough treatments had
   the advantage of ground cover over winter compared with autumn plough
   treatments.  The problems associated with straw incorporation in the
   spring could be alleviated by removing the straw by baling but this
   practice removed 16.0 kg N ha-1 year-1 and 1600 kg C ha-1 year-1 from
   the soil system.  Grain N concentration was decreased by 10\% if straw
   was incorporated in the spring compared with autumn incorporation. 
   Straw N concentration was decreased with spring ploughing compared with
   autumn ploughing when straw was incorporated and also when straw was
   removed by bailing.  Total plant N was decreased by spring ploughing
   compared with autumn ploughing if straw was incorporated.  Incorporation
   of straw also decreased total plant N compared with removing the straw
   with spring but not with autumn ploughing.  Under a no straw-direct
   seeding treatment, grain yield and plant N uptake were generally less
   than in the no straw-tillage systems.
   Straw-tillage treatment effects on grain yield and plant N uptake were
   attributed to differences in seedbed quality and mineral N levels. 
   Lower spring and autumn soil NO3-N levels in the straw-spring plough and
   direct seeding treatments throughout the 4 crop years were attributed to
   great N immobilisation compared with the autumn plough and no
   straw-spring plough treatments.
   This field study showed that although spring incorporation of straw and
   direct seeding treatments encountered seedbed problems and lower N
   availability, these treatments with added N could be as productive and
   be more sustainable systems than other treatments as they enjoy
   advantages in terms of better soil conservation and less harmful
   environmental impact.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous biological, chemical, and physical indicators of soil quality
   have been suggested, but few have been evaluated using data from
   long-term field studies. Our objective was to evaluate several proposed
   soil quality indicators to determine effects of removing, doubling, or
   maintaining crop residues for 10 years in a no-till, continuous corn
   (Zea mays L.) production study. Soil aggregate characteristics,
   penetration resistance, bulk density, volumetric water content,
   earthworm populations, respiration, microbial biomass, ergosterol
   concentrations, and several soil-test parameters (pH, P, K, Ca, Mg,
   Total-N, Total-C, NH4-N, and NO3-N) were measured on samples collected
   from Rozetta and Palsgrove silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic
   Hapludalfs) soils. Soil aggregates from double residue treatments were
   more stable in water than those from normal and removal treatments. The
   double and normal residue treatments had higher total carbon
   concentrations and higher levels of microbial activity as measured by
   CO2 evolution. Ergosterol concentrations where crop residues were
   removed were 8 to 10 times lower suggesting this biochemical measurement
   of fungal biomass may be a sensitive soil quality indicator. Earthworm
   populations where crop residues had been removed for 10 years were
   significantly lower than in either normal or double residue treatments.
   Measures of force and energy required to crush soil aggregates were
   extremely variable and showed significant differences only for aggregate
   size. Several parameters were used to develop a soil quality index that
   gave ratings of 0.45, 0.68, or 0.86 for removal, normal, or double
   residue treatments,}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation in 1 year old, 4 year old, 8 year old, and 8 year old
   fertilized fields were compared with weeds, in no-till and conventional
   till winter-rye summer-grain sorghum crop fields planted on the same
   site following the natural successional series. Crop stands were
   fertilized and treated with herbicide but at a minimum rate. Sorenson's
   indices of similarity were used to make the comparisons. Old field
   vegetation was quite different from the weedy growth in crop fields,
   quantitative similarity indices only 1-18\%. The six maj or dominant
   species in old fields were not found at all in the crop fields, while
   the major crop weeds were found only sparingly in old-fields, with the
   exception of johnson grass (Sorghum halapense). The no-till plot and the
   8 year old fertilized field were the most similar (18\%). It is
   concluded that species that become noxious agricultural weeds are those
   that adapt to fertilization and develop resistance to herbicides, and in
   general do not thrive in natural ecosystems. Accordingly, following crop
   fields does not result in a seedbank buildup of species that will become
   weeds when crops are again planted on the land. If this finding proves
   to be general then a crop-fallow rotation practice will reduce weed
   problems and sustain soil quality over the long term.}},

Abstract = {{At more than 200 sites in the Netherlands, the soil is contaminated with
   cyanide as a result of industrial activities. The mobility of cyanide,
   which mainly occurs in the form of iron cyanide complexes {[}Fe(CN)63- +
   Fe(CN)64-], plays an important role in predicting the possible hazards
   for the environment and human health. Cyanide mobility was investigated
   by assessing data on cyanide concentrations in groundwater at
   contaminated sites, and by examination of three contaminated soils. High
   cyanide concentrations were found in the groundwater at sites with
   alkaline soils (pH ca. 7.5), whereas much lower concentrations were
   found in the groundwater with acidic soils (pH ca. 4). This agreed with
   the assumption that the behavior of cyanide in these contaminated soils
   is largely governed by the solubility of Prussian blue
   {[}Fe4(Fe(CN)6)3(s)], which is relatively insoluble under acidic
   conditions. In the acidic soils, the concentrations in the soil water
   appeared to be close to equilibrium with Prussian blue. In alkaline
   soils this precipitate is extremely soluble. The presence of this
   material here was possibly the result of slow dissolution kinetics.
   Precipitation of Prussian blue in acidic soils does not prevent
   dissolved iron cyanide concentrations from exceeding Dutch soil quality
   standards.}},

Title = {{Soil quality criteria derived from critical body concentrations of
   metals in soil invertebrates}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Statistical methods that have been developed to estimate critical ( or
   maximum acceptable) levels of toxic chemicals in soils use as input data
   external threshold concentrations (ETC), which are usually estimated by
   ``no observed effect concentrations{''} derived from laboratory
   experiments. These experiments often do not reflect the bioavailability
   of the chemical for an organism as experienced in the field. This may
   cause deviations between laboratory ETC and the `real' ETC in the field.
   In this paper it is proposed to base the calculation of soil quality
   criteria on ETC in the field, derived from internal threshold
   concentrations in soil invertebrates and field concentration factors. An
   example for cadmium shows that this approach leads to a higher variance
   in threshold concentrations for the field compared with the variance in
   laboratory ETC. This is explained by large differences in the rate at
   which soil invertebrates take up chemicals from their environment, i.e.
   the bioavailability. The calculation of critical levels is influenced
   strongly by variance in the data; as a result the critical level based
   on threshold concentrations in the field is lower than the critical
   level based on laboratory threshold concentrations. This demonstrates
   clearly the importance of a good estimate of the variation in ETC caused
   by differences in bioavailability.}},

Abstract = {{In Eastern Canada, cereal yields are often restricted by soil acidity
   and low fertility. Continuous cereal production can also lead to soil
   structural degradation. The addition of lime and fertilizers and the
   adoption of conversation tillage practices are proposed solutions which
   may have a positive impact on soil quality. The objective of the present
   work was to assess the impact of 3 years of different tillage practices
   and P additions, and of a single lime addition on organic C and total N,
   microbial biomass C, and on N mineralization at the surface layer (0-7.5
   cm) of a Courval sandy clay loam (Humic Gleysol). The easily
   mineralizable N, total amount of N mineralized in 22.1 weeks, the rate
   of N mineralization, and microbial biomass C were significantly greater
   in the minimum tillage than in the moldboard plow treatment. Chisel plow
   treatment showed intermediate values. The ratios of potentially
   mineralizable N and of easily mineralizable to total soil N were also
   significantly larger under minimum tillage and chisel plowing than under
   moldboard plowing. The lime and P treatments had no significant effect
   on the measured soil quality parameters. The total amount of N
   mineralized per unit of biomass C decreased as the tillage intensity
   increased, suggesting a decrease in the efficiency of the biomass in
   transforming organic N into potentially plant-available forms and thus a
   loss in soil organic matter quality. The results of this study indicate
   that conservation tillage practices such as rototilling and chisel
   plowing are efficient ways of maintaining soil organic matter quality
   when old pastures are brought back into cultivation.}},

Abstract = {{Although the pest status of the European Mole Talpa europaea L. in
   Britain has never been adequately assessed, it is perceived as being a
   pest of agricultural and amenity land and is widely persecuted. We
   review the Mole's pest status, and evaluate current and proposed control
   methods.
   While there has been a recent decline in the demand for strychnine,
   abuse of this poison leads annually to the death of many wild and
   domestic animals. The need remains for a humane, practical and safe
   alternative. If strychnine were banned without such an alternative being
   available, the use of mole-traps would probably increase. Through
   post-mortem examination of trapped Moles we evaluate the humaneness of
   these traps.
   Our returned questionnaires showed that, while most farmers perceive
   Moles as pests, the damage which is attributed to them is slight on the
   great majority of farms. Control of Moles was none the less common and
   widespread, and was undertaken by 49.5\% of respondents in 1992.
   Perceived pest status and the favoured method of control varied
   regionally; these trends may be related to soil quality and cultivation
   type.
   Silage pollution was the most widely cited agricultural problem
   attributed to Moles. Practical measures to reduce silage pollution by
   Moles are discussed, particularly with regard to silage collection and
   treatment using bacteriophages. The efficiency of these additives merits
   detailed study because they have the potential, regardless of whether
   pollution has occurred or not, to improve the quality of the silage to
   an extent that killing Moles may be unnecessary; less than 1\% of
   respondents reported that 10\% or more of their silage was seriously
   affected by Mole activity.}},

Abstract = {{The concept and some definitions of sustainable agriculture are
   reviewed. Most of these definitions include economic, environmental and
   sociological aspects. The finite area of land emphasizes the need for
   consideration of soil conservation and of soil quality in relation to
   sustainability. An important element of soil quality is rooting depth.
   Therefore loss of soil by erosion is a dominant factor in long-term
   sustainability. The effects of tillage on soil parameters in minimum
   data sets that have been proposed to describe soil quality are reviewed.
   Soil organic matter may be one of the most important soil quality
   characteristics in relation to tillage because of its influence on other
   soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Conservation tillage
   practices can increase the organic matter content, aggregate stability
   and cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the topsoil. However, bulk density
   and penetrometer resistance are also increased, especially with zero
   tillage. Although such soil quality parameters may form a basis for
   describing some of the consequences of particular tillage practices,
   they do not provide a basis for predicting the outcome in terms of crop
   growth and yield. This is both because critical values of soil quality
   parameters have not been defined and because in some soils biopore
   formation in zero or minimally tilled land can modify the soil for water
   movement and for root growth and function.
   The effects of tillage on crop growth and yield in long-term experiments
   are reviewed. The review only includes experiments in North America,
   Europe and New Zealand that have lasted 10 years or more to allow for
   seasonal variation in weather, possible progressive changes in soil
   conditions and the learning phase often experienced when new tillage
   methods are used. While there is a good deal of variation in the results
   of these tillage experiments some patterns have emerged. In long-term
   experiments, yields of maize in Europe and the US and soybeans in the US
   have been similar after ploughing and no-tillage. especially on
   well-drained soils. In Europe. yields of winter cereals have also been
   similar after traditional and simplified tillage but yields of spring
   cereals have sometimes been less, after direct drilling than ploughing.
   Trends in tillage practices are reviewed. Conservation tillage in the US
   is increasing and is used on about 30\% of cropland. including no-till
   on about 10\% of cropland. This increase in use of conservation tillage
   is mainly attributed to the legal requirement for farmers who arc in
   government price support programs to adopt conservation plans which may
   involve conservation tillage. However, the allowable rates of erosion in
   these plans are likely to be in excess of rates of erosion for long-term
   sustainability. Survey information on tillage practices needs to be
   considered in relation to predictions on suitability of conservation
   tillage based on experimental results- In the semi-arid prairies of
   Canada there is a trend toward fewer cultivation operations, but in
   eastern Canada the mouldboard plough is still the dominant tillage
   method. In Europe although erosion is less obvious it is believed to be
   increasing, but minimum tillage is not widely used. This is because of
   the need to remove at least some straw for successful minimum tillage in
   sequential winter wheat and barley crops. but there are few economic
   uses for straw, and burning is illegal in many countries. In the more
   moist cooler conditions of Europe grass weed proliferation is another
   constraint, at least with present terminology, So far, the overall
   success of conservation tillage has not been limited by the growing
   problem of genetic resistance of weeds to herbicides. Societal attitudes
   to the continued use of herbicides may pose longer-term problems for
   some conservation tillage practices.}},

Abstract = {{Urban areas are expanding rapidly. Therefore the interest in soil
   science activities on urban and industrial sites grows. The paper gives
   an overview of the research and mapping activities in Germany. A model
   of soils in urban ecosystems shows the relationships of development of
   soils and soil quality to land use. The water regime of soils is
   influenced by the characteristics of urban landscape and sealing. Of
   special interest are the typical substrates. Some properties of soils
   which develop on tipped substrates of natural material are discussed. Of
   importance are technological substrates as rubble, ash, slag, waste
   material and sludges in urban environments. Proposals of classification
   of urban and industrial soils are presented. For proper use by the
   municipal authorities availability and application of information on
   urban soils must be a part of research.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology for evaluating the variability of risk resulting from the
   use of uniform, concentration-based soil-quality criteria is developed
   and applied to polychlorinated-biphenyl (PCB-) contaminated soil as an
   example. A modified version of a soil risk model developed by the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency is used to assess risk variability for
   different levels of PCBs in soil. representing different cleanup goals.
   Continuous distributions representing the variability in site conditions
   across the United States are assigned to parameters in the fate and
   transport model to examine the effect that such variability has on
   individual risk when uniform cleanup levels for PCBs in soil are used.
   It is found that for a fixed cleanup goal applied uniformly to all
   sites, the risk varies little for the case where the hypothetical
   exposure occurs on-site, but by as much as two orders of magnitude for
   the case where the hypothetical maximally exposed individual resides
   off-site. Depending on the risk goal of the remediation program, some
   risk variability may be acceptable and a uniform cleanup goal may be
   warranted to expedite the remediation process.}},

Abstract = {{Soil carbon distribution with depth, stable carbon isotope ratios in
   soil organic matter and their changes as a consequence of the presence
   of legume were studied in three 12-year-old tropical pastures (grass
   alone - Brachiaria decumbens (C-4), legume alone - Pueraria phaseoloides
   (C-3) and grass + legume) on an Oxisol in Colombia. The objective of
   this study was to determine the changes that occurred in the C-13
   isotope composition Of soil from a grass + legume pasture that was
   established by cultivation of a native savanna dominated by C-4
   vegetation. The C-13 natural abundance technique was used to estimate
   the amount of soil organic carbon originating from the legume. Up to
   29\% of the organic carbon in soil of the grass + legume pasture was
   estimated to be derived from legume residues in the top 0-2-cm soil
   depth, which decreased to 7\% at 8-10 cm depth. Improvements in soil
   fertility resulting from the soil organic carbon originated from legume
   residues were measured as increased potential rates of nitrogen
   mineralization and increased yields of rice in a subsequent crop after
   the grass + legume pasture compared with the grass-only pasture. We
   conclude that the C-13 natural abundance technique may help to predict
   the improvements in soil quality in terms of fertility resulting from
   the presence of a forage legume (C-3) in a predominantly C-4 grass
   pasture.}},

Abstract = {{Dutch initiatives into the development of indicators for sustainable
   development received a major impetus with a workshop held in 1989.
   Subsequent work has focused on the development of such indicators within
   environmental policy themes. This paper reports on the development of an
   indicator within the environmental policy theme `diffusion' - the
   movement of toxic micropollutants into and throughout the environment.
   This theme presents a challenge to indicator development because of the
   myriad substances (including heavy metals, PCBs, pesticides and their
   residues, radiation) and behaviours on release. Consequently, a case
   study was undertaken in which consideration was limited to cadmium
   accumulation in soil.
   Development of a sustainability indicator required specification of the
   sustainability context and associated criteria. We propose two criteria,
   both of which must be satisfied for sustainability: (1) additions of
   cadmium to the soil from all sources (atmospheric deposition, fertilizer
   use and sewage sludge disposal) should not exceed losses from the soil
   due to leaching, runoff and uptake by crops; and (2) the total volume or
   concentration of cadmium in the soil should not exceed soil quality
   standards.
   A pictorial presentation for the indicator, known as a `state space', is
   proposed in which the two criteria define the axes of a graph. The
   format offers implications for policy, particularly the urgency of
   implementation and the severity of measures. As with most indicators,
   more information is conveyed with time series. Output from a dynamic
   materials balance is used to generate such a time series. Via these
   development trajectories and alternative scenarios reflected by the
   dynamic materials balance, policies can be assessed by their capacity to
   move the system towards more sustainable conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The present investigation studies the effects of cow and chicken manure
   and sewage sludge at different rates of addition and with two irrigation
   waters of different salinities on two major calcareous soils in Bahrain.
   The aim was to quantify potential improvements in soil quality, the
   accumulation of trace metals, and quality of leachates.
   From the pot experiments it was found that soil waterholding capacity
   did not change significantly after addition of organic amendments,
   except in the case of sewage sludge.  Total organic carbon and total
   Kjeldhal nitrogen content increased in the 0-5 cm layer.  Low salinity
   water and sewage applications improved aggregate stability.  Extractable
   phosphorus was enhanced by the chicken manure treatment more than
   others.  Addition of different organic amendments did not affect
   exchangeable cations.  pH values did not show appreciable changes and
   soils were neutral.  Trace metals studied were present at non-toxic
   levels in the 0-5 cm layer.  Zinc and copper were the only metal showing
   a tedency to leach to the lower soil layer.  In all cases metal levels
   in the surface layer were proportional to the quantities added in the
   amendments and their levels in the leachate were very low.}},

Abstract = {{Land evaluation is an important basis for landscape and land use
   planning. A framework was developed for land evaluation in an area of
   severe erosion, focusing on integrative, process and ecological
   analyses. Two classification systems, soil quality and erosion risk,
   were combined in the land evaluation framework. The Quanjiagou
   catchment, with typical loess hill and gully topography, in the loess
   plateau of China was selected as the study area. A geographical
   information system (GIS) was used for data storage, analysis and
   display. The soil quality classification was based on the main
   characteristics of the soils (soil organic matter, effective depth of
   soil and soil moisture); four soil quality classes were defined in the
   study area. Slope, micro-landform type and the type and processes of
   soil erosion were integrated to classify the erosion risk. The soil
   qualities and erosion risk for each site were combined using the GIS to
   evaluate the suitability of the land for farmland, grassland and forest.
   By comparing these results with the current land use, measures for
   better land use and conservation are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{This paper claims that countries of the North must develop a new model
   of wealth - one less harmful to the environment and capable of being
   applied throughout the world. There are reasons to be hopeful they will
   do so: first, they have the means at their disposal; second, it is a
   misconception that environmental protection is a cost; and third, there
   is mounting pressure for change as indicated by air, water and soil
   quality data. The challenge is to move the emphasis away from
   end-of-the-pipe pollution control to improving resource productivity.
   The best way of doing this is through the imposition of `green taxes' to
   raise resource prices. If governments compensate by cutting other taxes
   to make the change revenue-neutral, there would be real benefits to the
   environment and the economy, particularly in developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced tillage systems in the Central Great Plains have improved
   precipitation storage efficiency and increased the potential to crop
   more intensively than with the traditional crop-fallow system. More
   intensive cropping will require additional N input to maintain
   economical yields. Nitrogen fertility requirements for optimum crop
   yields in a dryland, annual cropping system were studied. Six N
   fertilizer rates (0, 22, 45, 67, 90, and 134 kg N ha-1) were applied to
   the same plots for 8 crops on a Weld silt loam (montmorillonitic, mesic
   Aridic Paleustoll). Spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), com (Zea mays
   L.), and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were grown in rotation from
   1984 through 1991. Although grain yields varied with crop and year,
   average annual grain production was 2108, 2683, 3162, 3459, 3382, and
   3411 kg ha-1 for the above N rates, respectively. This included 1 yr of
   zero yield, when a corn crop was lost due to hail, and 1 yr of low
   barley yields due to heat and water stress at anthesis. This compares
   with annualized winter wheat yields of 1381 kg ha-1 yr-1 produced in an
   adjacent crop-fallow system with adequate applied N. Application of 67
   kg N ha-1 each crop year or, based on regression analysis, an average
   available N (soil plus fertilizer) supply of 170 kg N ha-1 was
   sufficient to optimize (95\% of maximum) grain yields over the 8-yr
   period. These results indicate a high potential for adopting more
   intensive dryland cropping systems in the Central Great Plains to
   increase water use efficiency and better maintain soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{There is considerable interest in the use of coal combustion byproducts
   as soil liming materials in agricultural production, but there is
   concern that such use may be detrimental to the quality of agricultural
   soils. To evaluate these byproducts as liming materials and address
   issues related to soil quality, we compared the influence of different
   amounts of four combustion byproducts {[}fly ash and bed ash from a
   fluidized bed combustion furnace, lime-injected multistage burner
   residue, and spray dryer residue] and CaCO3 on soil pH and activities of
   urease, phosphatase, arylsulfatase, and dehydrogenase in an acidic soil.
   Studies comparing the influence of the combustion byproducts and CaCO3
   on soil pH showed that on a weight basis of application, substantial
   differences were observed in the ability of these materials to influence
   soil pH but that such differences decreased markedly after the data were
   transformed to a CaCO3 equivalent basis of application. Analysis of
   covariance for these transformed data indicated that whereas the liming
   abilities of fly ash and CaCO3 were not significantly different when
   compared on the CaCO3 equivalent basis, those of bed ash, multistage
   burner residue, and spray dryer residue were less than that of CaCO3.
   Studies comparing the influence of the byproducts and CaCO3 on soil
   enzyme activities showed that the effect of these liming materials on
   the enzyme activities studied was largely due to their influence on soil
   pH. The relationships obtained between soil pH and enzyme activities in
   soil amended with the liming materials generally demonstrated the marked
   similarities in the influence of the combustion byproducts and CaCO3 on
   these activities when observed within the domain of soil pH. These
   studies showed that the combustion byproducts tested functioned as soil
   liming materials in a manner similar to that of CaCO3 and seemed to have
   little adverse effect on soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) is valuable, because of both its beneficial
   effect on soil quality and crop productivity and its potential to
   sequester C. Long-term experiments provide an opportunity to identify
   crop management practices that enhance or degrade soil quality. This
   study was initiated in 1931 to determine residue management effects on
   crop yield and SOM (organic C and N) in a winter wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L.)-fallow system. The soil is a coarse-silty, mixed, mesic
   Typic Haploxeroll. Treatments include (units ha-1 crop-1) 22.4 Mg
   manure, 2.24 Mg pea vine residue, 0, 45, and 90 kg N with and without
   spring burning of straw, and 0 kg N with fall burning of straw. Yearly C
   and N inputs and removals have been determined since 1976, and
   calculated for prior periods. Soil C and N have been determined at
   almost-equal-to 11-yr intervals. Manure, which supplies 111 kg N ha-1
   crop-1, has consistently produced the highest yield and maintained the
   highest soil C and N contents. Other treatments initially yielded from
   80 to 90\% of the manure treatment, but have progressively declined in
   direct relation to decreasing soil N content. Low-fertility treatments
   currently yield from 43 to 57\% of the manure treatment. The change in
   soil C and N with time is nearly linear for all treatments, and highly
   correlated with residue input. Treatment effects on soil C and N have
   been confined to the top 30 cm of soil, but there has been a slow steady
   decline in C and N in the 30- to 60-cm zone that is not related to
   residue management.}},

Abstract = {{Total soil N and N mineralization rate partially characterize the
   influence of various cropping systems on the growth of sequent crops in
   a rotation. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the
   relationship among cropping system. total N and mineralizable N; and (2)
   compare amount of N mineralized under controlled laboratory conditions
   with plant N uptake under greenhouse conditions. Three cropping systems
   that have been in operation between 9 and 60 yr on a Gray Luvisol
   (Breton loam) were selected. They included: (1) an agroecological (AER)
   8-yr rotation involving fababeans as green manure (AERI sampled after
   the first fababean crop and AER2 sampled after 3 yr of continuous
   forage); (2) continuous grain system (CG), with fertilizer N at 90 kg
   h-1 yr-1; initiated in 1980 and considered established in 1981; (3) a
   classicial Breton rotation (CBR) involving a long-term (ca. 1930) 5-yr
   rotation with forages and cereals and no return of crop residues (CBR1
   fertilized with P-K-S and CBR2 unfertilized). We caution that not all
   phases of each rotation were sampled; our conclusions pertain to
   N-mineralization potential in soil samples immediately preceding barley
   as sequent crop in each rotation. The rate of N mineralization declined
   with time, but it remained greater than zero after 20 wk of incubation
   in all soils. Mineral-N accumulation at 20 wk followed the order AER1 >
   AER2 > > CBR1 > CBR2 = CG. Mineralizable soil N, following one cycle of
   the AER rotation, was almost double that following 60 yr of the CBR
   rotation. Data for mineral-N accumulation under laboratory conditions
   were described best by a single-component exponential model.
   Legume-based rotations were associated with increased total soil N and a
   greater proportional increase in active N than in total soil N. Active N
   was least in soil under the CG system. The incubation-extraction
   procedure resulted in higher estimates of mineralizable N than did the
   plant-uptake method; however, the ranking of N-supplying power of soils
   was the same.}},

Abstract = {{There exists a need (i) to test, whether equal or better cereal yields
   could be obtained using cropping systems which rely on renewable
   resources rather than on fertilizer nitrogen; and (ii) to discover the
   condition of the soil resource under these systems.
   The long-term cropping systems on a Gray Luvisol at Breton were studied.
   They included: (i) an agro-ecological 8-yr rotation (AER), established
   in 1981, which involved addition of both fababean green manure and
   manure from livestock fed with forages and fababeans grown in the
   rotation: (ii) a continuous grain (barley) system (CG), with fertilizer
   N at 90 kg ha-1 y-1, established in 1981; (iii) a classical Breton 5-yr
   rotation (CBR) involving forages and cereals, with no return of crop
   residues or manure, established in 1930. Mean barley yields were 16-19\%
   higher in the AER (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) than in the CG system,
   and yield on either was about double that of the CBR. Within 9 yr, there
   was evidence of increased total C, N, and P; available N, P and K, CEC;
   microbial biomass, microbial respiration; and counts of bacteria, fungi,
   and mycorrhizae in the AER compared with the CG system.
   We conclude that biological fixation of N by legumes can be used as the
   sole source of N for barley production on Luvisolic soils of low
   fertility such as the Breton loam, without sacrificing yield or soil
   quality. Barley yields in the AER (38\% of the rotation time) exceeded
   those of barley grown under continuous cereal cropping. The soil
   resource was maintained or improved during a 10-yr period under AER
   compared to the CG or CBR systems. Further research is needed to
   discover the mechanisms involved in regulating biological activity and
   availability of plant nutrients other than N in the AER system.}},

Abstract = {{The cumulative extent of soil redistribution by erosion and tillage was
   measured by comparing the Cs-137 content of a soil under intensive
   potato production with that of an undisturbed forest soil. Soil
   redistribution rates estimated from Cs-137 contents for the cultivated
   site varied from a loss of as high as 19.0 kg m-2 year-1 (190 t ha-1
   year-1) to a gain of as much as 4.3 kg m-2 year-1 (43 t ha-1 year-1),
   with an average of 5.3 kg m-2 year-1 (53 t ha-1 year-1) soil loss.
   Measured soit Cs-137 content and calculated soil loss (and deposition)
   were both found to be correlated with total potato yield (P<0.01), and
   with tuber specific gravity (P<0.05), in the two years of yield
   measurements (1991 and 1992). These years had near normal growing season
   precipitation, but contrasting distribution patterns of precipitation
   during the growing season. Estimated soil loss and gain were also
   correlated (P<0.01) with soil organic carbon and soil phosphorus
   contents. It is concluded that soil redistribution within the site,
   caused by either water erosion or tillage, or a combination of both
   these processes, had a marked effect on soil productivity.}},

Abstract = {{The paper addresses the estimation of soil quality for evaluating
   cleaning-up alternatives for polluted soils. In many practical
   applications the goal of a high soil quality after cleaning-up cannot be
   reached due to budget constraints. The selection of the cleaning-up
   technique thus requires trade off analyses between soil quality and
   costs. To measure soil quality it is necessary to know dose-effect
   functions, which translate contaminant concentrations into effects.
   Since dose-effect functions are not available for most common
   pollutants, substitute evaluations based on expert judgements are used.
   The paper addresses the assessment of expert-based value functions to
   measure relative soil quality. It describes a software package designed
   for the assessment of expert judgement and shows the use of the system
   in red applications. Finally, it shows the results of five expert
   assessments and analyses their responses.}},

Abstract = {{The toxic effects of pollutants on the soil microflora was studied as
   part of a research program aimed at the setting of soil quality
   standards. The effects of pentachlorophenol, zinc or hydrochloric acid
   on the mineralization of 1 mu g/L {[}C-14] acetate to (CO2)-C-14 was
   Studied in an acid surface soil an acid subsoil, an calcareous surface
   soil and a calcareous subsoil. The chalky surface soil was most
   sensitive for pentachlorophenol (PCP) which caused a marked stimulation
   of the (CO2)-C-14 production at low doses. The chalky subsurface soil
   was most sensitive for zinc. The chalky soil and subsoil neutralized
   added HCl more rapidly and showed a stronger sorption of zinc compared
   with the acidic soils. Nevertheless these soils showed a much higher
   sensitivity for acid, zinc and also for pentachlorophenol. The
   microflora of the acid surface soil were relatively resistant to acid,
   PCP or zinc. This resistant microflora showed a relatively low acetate
   mineralization rate.}},

Abstract = {{A Stipa-Bouteloua community, cultivated in the autumn of 1928 and
   abandoned in the spring of 1932, reverted to a community dominated by
   needle-and-thread (Stipa comata Trin. and Rupr.). An exclosure to
   prevent grazing was constructed in 1978 to include equal portions of
   previously cultivated and adjacent native range, while the remainder of
   the area continued to be subjected to moderate to heavy grazing
   pressure. This permitted a study to determine the effects of the brief
   period of cultivation on forage production, species recovery, and soil
   physical and chemical characteristics compared to those of native
   prairie. After 14 years of protection from grazing, needle-and-thread
   accounted for 79\% of foliar cover of the abandoned cultivation and 18\%
   of the untreated range while blue grama {[}Bouteloua gracilis (HBK.)
   Lag. ex Steud] occupied 1 and 51\% on the same treatments, respectively.
   After 60 years, the soil on the abandoned cultivated area showed reduced
   carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and hydraulic conductivity
   but increased N0(3)-N. Grazing reduced hydraulic conductivity, NH4-N,
   available mineralizable nitrogen (chemical index), available phosphorus,
   and total carbohydrates but increased carbon, total nitrogen, and
   N0(3)-N. Cultivation and grazing resulted in reduced root mass. To
   facilitate a rapid transition from blue grama to needle-and-thread
   stable communities, input of energy, such as cultivation, may well be
   required.}},

Abstract = {{The economic performance of organic amendments (including perennial
   hay), which contribute to maintaining soil quality, in spring wheat
   rotations was evaluated using data from a long-term rotation established
   in 1951 on Dark Brown Chernozem (Typic Haploboroll) soil at Lethbridge,
   Alberta. Net farm income was determined for six rotations over 31 years
   (1954-1984) and four replicates, using actual yields and 1992 prices.
   The six rotations included continuous wheat (W), fallow-wheat (FW),
   fallow-wheat-wheat (FWW), FWW with cattle manure applied during fallow
   (F(M)WW), fallow-wheat-grass/alfalfa hay (FWWAAA), and
   fallow-wheat-grass hay (FWWGGG).  None of the treatments received
   commercial fertilizer.  At a hay price of \$65 t-1 and a low wheat price
   of \$90 t-1, rotation ranking by net farm income (NFI) was FWWAAA >
   FWWGGG = FW > FWW> F(M)WW > W. At a wheat price of \$145 t-1, ranking by
   NFI was FW = FWW = FWWAAA = F(M)WW > FWWGGG > W. At a high wheat price
   of \$200 t-1, rotation ranking by NFI was F(M)WW = FWW = FW > FWWAAA > W
   = FWWGGG. Crop rotations with organic amendments were generally as
   profitable as rotations without amendments, though the price of hay and
   wheat determined which rotation was the most profitable.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality is more difficult to define than air and water quality but
   it has an impact especially on the latter, The export of soil-based
   nutrients to waters is of increasing concern. Policy aiming at
   preservation of soil quality can be either effect-orientated or
   source-orientated. Statutory measures for soil protection in the
   Netherlands originate from the Soil Protection Act (SPA), which came
   into force in January, 1987, The SPA still is a framework law which
   provides very general regulations only. Practical implementation is
   achieved by means of General Administrative Orders (GAG). The law offers
   a framework for measures and regulations to protect the properties of
   soil which constitute the conditions for proper soil functioning. The
   first GAO introduced was the `Decree on use of animal manure', which
   became operational on 1 April 1987. During recent decades there has been
   a large increase of intensive animal husbandry in the Netherlands, This
   development led to a strong imbalance between minerals imported in the
   country in the form of feed and raw materials for feed production, and
   minerals exported by dairy and animal products. The minerals produced in
   manure and animal slurries are far exceeding the amounts needed for
   proper crop fertilization. Standards for the use of animal manure are
   based on the phosphate content but this results in the application of
   unacceptable amounts of nitrogen and heavy metals, Phosphate saturation
   of soil was safeguarded by introducing special regulations for
   P-saturated soils, However, this has not been successful on judicial
   basis, indicating the need for general environmental protection
   legislation, instead of the compartmental (air-water-soil) approach.}},

Abstract = {{The world population continues to grow rapidly while also demanding a
   safe, secure food supply. This supply is produced on a limited soil and
   water base which needs to be protected today and for future generations.
   By adapting to the control methods that are being used, current and new
   pests are changing and thriving under the conditions we provide while we
   produce food. A resource efficient and sustainable food production chain
   requires that producers of crops and livestock have a selection of safe,
   effective tools to manage pests to acceptable levels, and to minimize
   their ability to adapt. At present, the problem exists that those with
   responsibility for pest management, like government policy makers,
   government regulators, the pest control industry, research and expert
   committees, food producers and consumers, lack a long-term strategic
   plan on how to manage pests safely and effectively. Such a strategic
   plan would clearly identify effective pest management as a major key,
   one that would give food producers the means of providing for food
   security while maintaining soil quality and wildlife habitat. Because of
   the speed at which pest resistance or adaptation is occurring, the
   process of developing the long-term strategy must be put in place
   quickly.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition of protons, nitrate and sulphate have caused a decrease in
   soil pH and base saturation in southern Scandinavia. Floral changes have
   been suggested to be due to this deposition. This study was made to test
   if differences in nitrate assimilation capability between plants could
   be one of the reasons behind reported changes in the flora. Current and
   maximally induced nitrate reductase activity (C-NRA and MI-NRA,
   respectively) were measured in four beech forest field-layer species,
   which have been reported to behave differently with respect to acid
   rain. The study was conducted at four sites of different soil quality
   (pH). There were considerable differences between the species as regards
   both C-NRA and MI-NRA. For two of the studied species, Galium odoratum
   and Stellaria nemorum, the gap between C- and MI-NRA was relatively
   small but for Mercurialis perennis and Oxalis acetosella, this gap was
   larger. A small difference between C- and MI-NRA should indicate that a
   larger portion of the available resources for nitrate reduction is
   already used. The concentrations of soluble carbohydrates were
   correlated with the MI-NRA after leafing of beech, while before leafing
   no such effect could be detected. It can be concluded that the light
   environment has a considerable effect on the nitrate nutrition of
   field-layer plants. Apparently, some species receive as much nitrate as
   they can reduce. Fertiliser experiments are needed to test if higher
   addition rates are harmful to them.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive coal mining in the hill state of Meghalaya, north-east India
   has resulted in ecological upheaval of thousands of hectares of land.
   The land which is directly hit by mining operations like excavation and
   dumping of overburden and coal is converted into new habitats, called
   colliery spoils, which lack completely the soil structure and whose
   elemental concentrations are greatly altered. The areas like hilltops,
   hillslopes and cultivated and abandoned agricultural fields, which are
   not directly hit by mining operations, though retaining their structure,
   are affected by deposition of coal particles through wind and seepage
   water. Both physical and chemical properties of colliery spoil showed a
   returning trend to the characteristic pre-mined levels of the soil
   during 20 years of natural recovery. However, the nutrient levels were
   still either significantly (P < 0.05) less (N,P,K,Mg and pH) or more
   (Ca, Mn, Zn, Fe and S) in the 20-year spoil compared to the pre-mined
   overburden soil.
   It is suggested that backfilling of the pits would be a cost-effective
   technique to maintain the approximate original contour. Properly planned
   channelization of seepage water is necessary to stop the deterioration
   of soil quality in agricultural fields and low-lying marginal lands.
   This would not only restore the nutrient level but also the vegetation
   cover or coal-mining-affected lands.}},

Abstract = {{Federal soil conservation policy in the U.S. has its roots in the New
   Deal era. Since that time conservation programs were not only aimed at
   controlling erosion but also at controlling production. The first issue
   in this article is how soil conservation policy dealt with growing
   public concern related to environmental impacts of modern agriculture.
   It was only in the last decade that conservation efforts not only
   included onsite impacts of soil erosion but also nonpoint-source
   pollution.  The ideas of soil protection and soil quality that gained
   some prominence in the Netherlands, Switzerland und Germany since the
   beginning of the 1980ies are still somewhat exotic in the U.S.
   The article continues by analyzing the legal background of federal U.S.
   soil conservation policy. This includes a brief sketch of the special
   features of the U.S. legal system in general, some remarks related to
   the strong position of private property and an outline of Agricultural
   Law as a legal discipline. Finally, the most recent soil-related
   agroenvironmental programs and laws are presented and the way they work
   is discussed. The characteristic feature not only of soil conservation
   but of all U.S. agricultural policy is its adherence to the so-called
   voluntary approach. With respect to the conservation programs there are
   two types. Under the first, the government makes payments available to
   producers who agree to follow certain practices ranging from the
   adoption of better conservation measures to the retirement of land from
   farming.  The second denies farmers the right to participate in
   commodity and other government benefits if they engage in certain
   environmentally destructive behavior.  Considering the ongoing federal
   budget deficit and the reduced attractiveness of federal farm programs
   the discussion on regulatory `'approaches'' will gain ground.}},

Abstract = {{The use of inter-row ground covers has been suggested to reduce soil

   6 yr of consistent inter-row management of ground covers or roto-tillage
   in raspberry on soil wet aggregate stability (WAS), bulk density,
   organic C and total N, and mineralizable nitrogen in the Fraser Valley
   of British Columbia was studied. Management treatments included no cover
   crop or cover crops of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), sheep's fescue
   (Festuca ovina L.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), and white
   clover (Trifolium repens L.). A general pattern of perennial grasses >
   legume arid barley > control was observed for soil WAS. Some
   quantitative and qualitative differences in the organic component of the
   soil profile to 30 cm were detected among management treatments. The
   differences were not statistically strong because the changes were small
   relative to the large pool present, but were relatively consistent
   overall. The white clover treatment tended to have more organic carbon,
   particularly in the subsurface, than the other treatments. The four
   treatments that included inter-row vegetation tended to have a greater
   amount of total and mineralizable N than the clean-tilled control. Crop
   vigour, as indicated by cane diameter, was reduced by the perennial
   grasses, but the inter-row management had only limited effects on berry
   yield. White clover appears to provide the best compromise between
   improving soil quality and minimizing competition with the berry crop.}},

Abstract = {{Soil degradation, decrease in soil's actual and potential productivity
   owing to land misuse, is a major threat to agricultural sustainability
   and environmental quality. The problem is particularly severe in the
   tropics and sub-tropics as a result of high demographic pressure,
   shortage of prime agricultural land, harsh environments, and resource
   poor farmers who presumably cannot afford science based recommended
   inputs. Tillage methods and soil surface management affect sustainable
   use of soil resources through their influence on soil stability, soil
   resilience, and soil quality. Soil stability refers to the
   susceptibility of soil to change under natural or anthropogenic
   perturbations. In comparison, soil resilience refers to soil's ability
   to restore its life support processes after being stressed. The term
   soil quality refers to the soil's capacity to perform its three
   principal functions e.g. economic productivity, environment regulation,
   and aesthetic and cultural values. There is a need to develop precise
   objective and quantitative indices of assessing these attributes of the
   soil. These indices can only be developed from the data obtained from
   well designed and properly implemented long-term soil management
   experiments conducted on major soils in principal ecoregions.}},

Abstract = {{A general model is presented in which the dynamics of decomposition in
   terrestrial ecosystems are determined by a set of hierarchically
   organized factors which regulate microbial activity at decreasing scales
   of time and space in the following order: climate - clay mineralogy +
   nutrient status of soil - quality of decomposing resources - effect of
   macroorganisms (i.e., roots and invertebrates). At the lower scale of
   determination, biological systems of regulation based on mutualistic
   relationships between macro- and microorganisms ultimately determine the
   rates and pathways of decomposition. Four such systems are defined,
   i.e., the litter and surface roots system, the rhizosphere, the
   drilosphere and the termitosphere in which die regulating macroorganisms
   arc respectively litter arthropods and surface roots, live subterranean
   roots, endogeic earthworms, and termites.
   In the humid tropics, this general model is often altered because
   climatic and edaphic constraints are in many cases not important and
   because high temperature and moisture conditions greatly enhance the
   activity of mutualistic biological systems of regulation which exert a
   much stronger control on litter and soil organic matter dynamics. This
   general hypothesis is considered in the light of available information
   from tropical rain forests and humid savannas. Theoretical and practical
   implications regarding the biodiversity issue and management practices
   are further It is concluded that biodiversity is probably determined, at
   least partly, by soil biological processes as a consequence of enhanced
   mutualistic interactions, which enlarge the resource base available to
   plants. It is also concluded that any effort to restore or rehabilitate
   degraded soils in the humid tropics is promised to fail unless optimum
   levels of root and invertebrate activities are promoted and the
   resulting regulation effects operate in the four abovedescribed
   biological systems of regulation. Research required to substantiate and
   adequately test the present set of concepts and hypotheses are
   expressed.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality is the most important factor for sustaining the global
   biosphere. Soil quality may be defined in several different ways
   including productivity, sustainability, environmental quality, and
   effects on human nutrition. To quantify soil quality, specific soil
   indicators need to be measured spatially. These indicators are mainly
   soil properties whose values relate directly to soil quality but may
   also include policy, economic, or environmental considerations. Because
   assessing soil quality is complex, the individual soil quality
   indicators need to be integrated to form a soil quality index. This
   integration needs to be flexible enough to evaluate soil quality at
   spatial scales ranging from the farm to the regional level, be
   applicable to all types of agricultural land use, and be able to
   incorporate all types of soil quality information. We have developed a
   multiple-variable indicator ranging (MVIK) procedure that may provide a
   means to integrate soil quality parameters into an index to produce soil
   quality maps on a landscape basis. These maps would indicate the areas
   on a landscape that have a high probability of having good soil quality
   according to predetermined criteria. This procedure can provide
   probability maps based on any range of chosen criteria and thus is
   universally applicable. In addition, it allows the identification of the
   indicator parameter(s) responsible for zones of low soil quality, thus
   allowing specific management plans or land use policies to be developed.}},

   leucocephala and Sorghum vulgare L. production around them was about two
   times the radius of the tree crown. Higher yields of plants under
   Ziziphus spina-christi than Faidherbia albida were explained by
   similarly higher concentrations of available phosphorus (P). Other soil
   parameters, including total nitrogen (N), were similar under both
   species; being higher under the tree canopies than away from them. The
   study identified optimum tree spacing for agroforestry to be twice the
   tree crown radius. It also demonstrated the advantages of multiple tree

Abstract = {{The main threats to soils are: extension of urbanization, acidification,
   accumulation of pollutants, nitrate in groundwater, loss of organic
   matter and deteriorating soil structure, soil compaction, and erosion.
   The latter is especially important in southern EC countries. Differences
   in the approaches adopted by different countries reflect differences in
   the nature and perceived seriousness of soil problems and the nature of
   the legislatory system. In particular, differences in the approaches of
   the Netherlands and the UK are discussed. The concept of `soil quality'
   is discussed in relation to these two approaches. Suggestions are given
   for an ecologically based soil protection policy. This paper discusses
   current soil protection policies and their development in the EC, and
   the evolution of the associated concept of `soil quality'. It does not
   deal in any detail with the restoration of soils which have been
   degraded by the inadequacy of past policies or their implementation.
   Emphasis is given to northern EC countries because they have been
   especially active in the development of policies which protect land and
   soils.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of the mineralization factors in contrasting cultivated
   soils is necessary for accurate predictions of plant-available N. The
   objective of this work was to determine the N-mineralization potential
   and mathematical models that can properly describe the dynamics of the
   mineralization process in 20 meadow soils from Quebec. The
   mineralization was monitored over 55.4 wk in a laboratory incubation at
   20-degrees-C with intermittent leaching. The cumulative mineralization
   curves in most soils were characterized by definite lags or a sigmoidal
   pattern and near-linear release with time after 20 wk. The data were
   best described by the Gompertz equation; first-order models were
   inadequate. The total amount of mineralizable N and the potential
   mineralization rate were very closely correlated with the total amounts
   of C or N (r > 0.73; P < 0.01). The clay content was also correlated
   with these mineralization parameters and significantly improved the
   prediction of the cumulative and potential N-mineralization rate
   estimated from the total N or C content of soils. The relationships with
   other soil characteristics such as soil pH and available nutrient
   contents were weak but significant. The results of this study suggest
   that textural classes be added in the correction for organic matter
   content to improve the precision in N-fertilizer recommendation and in
   soil-quality classifications based on potential mineralization rate.}},

Abstract = {{Crop rotations and tillage practices can modify not only the total
   amount of organic matter (OM) in soils but also its composition. The
   objective of this study was to determine the changes in total organic C,
   microbial biomass C (MBC), carbohydrates and alkaline phosphatase
   activity induced by 4 yr of different rotation and tillage combinations
   on a Kamouraska clay in La Pocatiere, Quebec. Two rotations (continuous
   barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) versus a 2-yr barley-red clover (Trifolium
   pratense L.) rotation) and three tillage treatments (moldboard plowing
   (MP), chisel plowing (CP) and no-tillage (NT)) were compared in a
   split-plot design. Total organic C was affected by the tillage
   treatments but not by the rotations. In the top soil layer (0-7.5 cm),
   NT and CP treatments had C contents 20\% higher than the MP treatment.
   In the same soil layer, MBC averaged 300 mg C kg-1 in the MP treatment
   and up to 600 mg C kg-1 in the NT soil. Hot-water-extractable and
   acid-hydrolyzable carbohydrates were on average 40\% greater under
   reduced tillage than under MP. Both carbohydrate fractions were also
   slightly larger in the rotation than in the soil under continuous
   barley. The ratios of MBC and carbohydrate C to total organic C
   suggested that there was a significant enrichment of the OM in labile
   forms as tillage intensity was reduced. Alkaline phosphatase activity
   was 50\% higher under NT and 20\% higher under CP treatments than under
   MP treatment and, on average, 15\% larger in the rotation than in the
   continuous barley treatment. Overall, the management-induced differences
   were slightly greater in the top layer (0-7.5 cm) than in the lower
   layer of the Ap horizon (7.5-15 cm). All the properties measured were
   highly correlated with one another. They also showed significant
   temporal variations that were, in most cases, independent of the
   treatments. Four years of conservation tillage and, to a lesser extent,
   rotation with red clover resulted in greater OM in the top soil layer
   compared with the more intensive systems. This organic matter was
   enriched in labile forms.}},

Abstract = {{In the Netherlands, fens that are fed by polluted river water are often
   eutrophic, whereas fens fed by calcium-rich groundwater often are
   mesotrophic. Differences in trophic status can not always be attributed
   to differences in the nutrient load of the water.
   In this paper we try to determine if the inflow of river water in fens,
   in fact, accelerates the soil nutrient release, thereby creating more
   eutrophic conditions ('internal eutrophication'). For this purpose, we
   compared nutrient release rates (N, P and K) in soil cores from Sphagnum
   peat and Carex peat saturated with different media, that were
   artificially created to mimic the three basic water sources: polluted
   river water, unpolluted calcium-rich groundwater and rainwater. In
   addition, we studied the effect of temperature and water level on
   nutrient release rates.
   The experiments proved that Sphagnum peat released much more P and
   ammonium than Carex peat. The strong site effect proved consistent
   throughout the water chemistry treatments, which indicates that soil
   quality may be the most important agent determining nutrient release
   rates. Nevertheless, it was established that water chemistry and water
   level are of significant influence on nutrient release rates in peat
   soils. In particular, fiver water stimulated P release by the peat, most
   notably in the Sphagnum peat. P-release in both soils was only minor
   when the soils were incubated in clean Ca-rich groundwater. It is
   suggested that P release is strongly associated with soil chemical
   processes, and that high P release rates after incubation in fiver water
   are due to the high sulphate content of the water.
   The net release from the soil of ammonium, potassium and phosphate
   increased with increasing temperature. A freezing treatment
   significantly increased nutrient availability.
   The results of the experiments are examined in the context of hydrologic
   management strategies for the conservation of fens in agricultural
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{In comparison with the environmental compartments air and water, soil is
   an extremely complicated system, because properties of the soil and
   chemical, physical and biological characteristics vary greatly between
   different soil systems. This makes the development of general rules for
   quantitative evaluation of soil quality impossible. The large variation
   between the buffering capacities of various soils for different
   compounds also complicates the question. In The Netherlands, a system of
   reference values for various compounds has been developed; these
   reference values reflect situations in which there is a low degree of
   contamination. For heavy metals, these reference values consist of
   sliding scales incorporating the influence of a soil's clay and organic
   matter content. Examples for derivation of effect-based soil quality
   standards are briefly described.}},

   necessary to respect the information from tables, maps and soil
   cartograms of complex soil investigation, from dates about soil quality
   units and from atlas of technological and climatic conditions. Further
   there is recommended to take in account all previous knowledge about
   suitable introduction of sugar beet in crop rotation. In newly arranged
   table there are collected the dates about value of foregoing crops and
   commented conditions of crop sequences and eventually its risks. It is
   necessary to avoid of introduction of sugar beet after unsuitable
   foregoing crops and to judge carefully the excessive concentration of
   sugar beet in less suitable conditions.}},

   fertilization and 2 sets of seed production measures. The occurence of
   infected tubers was mainly influenced by random factor dependent on soil
   quality and meteorological conditions. The increase of tuber infection
   by common scab was induced by: plenty of rainfall in May, high air
   temperature in June, good soil rich in phosphor and magnesium. Low level
   of the disease was related to high air temperature in May, soil rich in
   potassium, abudance of rainfall in June and resistance of cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of five crop rotations and the rotation phases (i.e.,
   rotation-yr) on some soil organic matter characteristics was
   investigated in a long-term (23 yr) study carried out on an Orthic Dark
   Brown Chemozemic soil at Scott, Saskatchewan. The cropping systems
   included different cropping frequencies and crop types (cereals,
   oilseeds, and legume-hay). Soil samples were taken from the 0- to 7.5-
   and 7.5- to 15-cm depths in mid-September 1988, 2 wk after harvest of
   the grain crops (i.e., 2 mo after hay harvest and plowdown). Most
   effects of rotations, and rotation phases, on soil biological
   characteristics assessed, were significant primarily in the top 7.5-cm
   soil depth. Increasing the cropping frequency did not increase soil
   organic matter. Excessive preseeding tillage of stubble plots may have
   masked any potential advantage provided by frequent cropping. Including
   alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay crops in rotation with grain crops
   decreased soil organic matter in the fallow and grain crop rotation
   phases of rotations. This was likely due to increased moisture stress
   depressing associated cereal production in this semiarid environment. As
   expected, rotation phase did not influence soil organic C, but alfalfa
   under-seeded into barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) increased soil organic
   nitrogen. We believe this was due to crop residue inputs from the
   seedling alfalfa. Microbial biomass C and N, C mineralization, the
   specific respiratory activity (ratio of CO2-C respired/microbial biomass
   C) and hydrolyzable amino acids were also greater in the rotation phases
   in which barley was underseeded with alfalfa. Carbon mineralization and
   specific respiratory activity were directly related to estimated crop
   residue-C returned to soil, but not residue-N. However, both were
   increased by including alfalfa in the rotation. Carbon mineralization
   and specific respiratory activity were more sensitive indexes of soil
   organic matter quality than biomass C and N per se. Hydrolyzable amino
   acids and amino sugars responded to the treatments in a manner similar
   to total soil organic N. Relative molar distribution of amino acids was
   unaffected by crop rotation or rotation phase. Potentially mineralizable
   N in this soil was low compared to other Canadian prairie soils, even
   though the total soil organic N of the Scott soil was relatively high.
   We concluded that (i) all soil biochemical characteristics studied are
   useful for assessing soil quality changes; (ii) when studying soil
   changes, thin (0- to 7.5-cm) soil slices are more likely to reveal
   treatment effects than thicker slices; (iii) all rotation phases should
   be analyzed whenever forage legumes are constituents of crop rotations.}},

Abstract = {{Effluent and other secondary waters have become important sources of
   irrigation water in the U.S. Southwest. Information is inadequate
   relative to potential long-term effluent irription effects on turfgrass
   and soil chemical quality. The objective of this field research was to
   determine the influence of secondarily treated municipal wastewater
   irrigation on the chemical quality of bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L.)
   turf soil (Sonoita gravelly sandy loam: coarse-loamy, mixed, thermic
   Typic Haplargid) when compared to similarly irrigated potable water
   plots. Research plots were irrigated using a 20\% leaching fraction.
   After 3.2 yr of use, effluent water increased soil electrical
   conductivity by 0.2 ds m-1, Na by 155 mg kg-1, P by 26 mg kg-1, and K by
   50 mg kg-1 in comparison to potable irrigated plots. Soil pH was not
   significantly affected by effluent irrigation. The concentrations of Fe,
   Mn, Cu, and Zn were found to be within the range considered normal for
   agricultural soil. Effluent irrigation increased soil total organic
   carbon and nitrogen during the first 1.3 yr of irrigation only. Total
   aerobic bacteria populations were similar in all irrigated plots
   indicating these microbes were not promoted or inhibited by the use of
   this wastewater. In summary, the irription of this turf soil for 3.3 yr
   with the secondarily treated wastewater used in this study had no
   serious detrimental effects on soil quality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents estimates of the macroeconomic impacts on the
   Canadian economy of an ethanol industry based on Jerusalem artichoke, an
   agricultural feedstock. It is assumed that this industry would not be
   grain-based, since other studies indicate that such an industry would
   not be economically viable in the absence of government intervention and
   would suffer from fluctuating prices tied to world grain markets.
   Moreover, Jerusalem artichoke has agronomic characteristics that make it
   potentially attractive for inclusion in rotations to improve soil
   quality. Results of the research indicate that this crop could be grown
   to the economic advantage of farmers and processed into ethanol, which
   could be used economically as an octane enhancer in gasoline. Based on
   the results for western Canada, the operation of an ethanol plant with a
   capacity of 100 ML a year would increase industrial output by \$154
   million, raise gross domestic product at factor cost by \$50 million,
   and create 1,365 jobs.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen retranslocation from senescing leaves represents a crucial
   adaptation by tree species towards a more efficient use of this
   nutrient. As a result, this part of the nitrogen cycle has received
   increasing attention in recent years. However, there remain strong
   discrepancies with respect to the factors responsible for interspecific
   differences in the efficiency of this process.
   In the present work the seasonal pattern of leaf growth and the movement
   of nitrogen in leaves have been studied in a series of Quercus ilex
   plots with different levels of rainfall ard soil quality in
   central-western Spain, as well as in 20 other woody species typical of
   this area. The percentage of nitrogen retranslocated was estimated from
   the difference between the maximum mass of nitrogen stored in the leaf
   biomass and the amount of this nutrient returned annually to the soil
   through leaf fall.
   Q. ilex appears as one of the least efficient species in the
   Mediterranean region in the recovery of nitrogen from senescing leaves
   (29.7\% of the maximum pool). Furthermore, the older leaves of Q. ilex
   do not show the cycles of nitrogen withdrawal during new flushes of
   shoot growth, such as occurs in Pinus spp. This suggests that older
   leaves in Q. ilex do not play an important role as nitrogen storage
   organs.}},

Abstract = {{Soon after the Chernobyl nuclear accident, the air-pumping stations in
   Pavia (northern Italy) were alerted.  In a few days, a rapid increase in
   radionuclide concentration in air particulates was observed. 
   Consequently, an environmental radioactivity monitoring programme was
   started in which several matrices such as soil, grass, vegetables and
   cows' milk were subjected to direct gamma-ray spectrometry.  The
   radioactivity distribution and its variation with time is presented,
   discussed and compared with other available data.  Detection limits,
   precision and accuracy are also reported, and depth profiles in soils
   for Cs-137 are presented and correlated with soil quality parameters.  A
   survey of environmental radioactivity in soil, in a search for residual
   Chernobyl fallout, was carried out and a map of the Cs-137 distribution

Abstract = {{Little is known about the chemical composition of throughfall, or the
   water that falls through, and drips from, the grass canopy of Rough
   Fescue Grassland during the grazing season. Water-extractable C, N,
   organic acids, and monosaccharides from litter and from soil in the
   upper 2 cm of the Ah horizon collected at monthly intervals in 1988 were
   assessed at Stavely, Alberta. Rough fescue (Festuca campestris Rydb.)
   grasslands were stocked at either light (1.2 AUM/ha) or very heavy (4.8
   AUM/ha) fixed rates for 39 years or were ungrazed in exclosures located
   within each field for an equal period of time. At the high grazing
   intensity, the soil and litter N was less water-extractable. The C/N
   ratios of the water-extractable organic matter from litter and soil
   averaged 11.2 and 2.3, respectively. Soil monosaccharides were
   essentially not water-extractable. The quality of the litter as
   reflected by the water-extractable constituents often differed over the
   season between fields. Observations at regular time intervals are
   essential. The effect of the quality of leachates of litter on soil was
   not predictable. The 3 major long-chain fatty acids identified,
   palmitic, stearic, and arachidic acids, from soil in grasslands that are
   in good condition because of the low grazing pressure, could well
   contribute to the resistance of those grasslands to the encroachment of
   invading species.}},

Journal = {{SOIL SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{153}},

Abstract = {{Effects of rock removal (stone picking) and rock crushing on soil
   properties, erosion, and potato (Solanum Tuberosum) quality were
   examined on a Carleton gravelly loam till soil (Typic Haplaquod) in New
   Brunswick, Canada.  The objective was to evaluate applicability of these
   operations to reduce tuber injury when a mechanical harvester was used
   in a stony field.  Seriously injured tubers were reduced from 38\% under
   existing field conditions (control) to 17\% after the field was crushed
   with a rock crusher.  In the rock-crushed field, no stones over 50 mm in
   diameter were found in the top 50 mm of soil.  Rock removal reduced
   coarse fragments greater than 50 mm in diameter from 6.8\% to 0.6\% by
   weight.  Although these operations facilitate the use of mechanical
   harvesters, they also adversely degrade soil quality and increase the
   potential for surface runoff and soil loss.  Rock removal reduced soil
   temperature whereas rock crushing deteriorated soil quality by reducing
   the number of water-stable aggregates greater than 0.5 mm in diameter,
   which significantly lowered soil aggregate mean-weight diameter.  For
   two rainfall events monitored shortly after plot establishment, average
   runoff from stone crushed plots was 3.0 and 1.5 times higher than the
   control; runoff from the stone removal treatment was 1.7 and 1.4 times
   higher than the control; and soil loss from the crushed and removed
   treatments was 2.0 and 1.5 times, respectively, higher than from the
   control.  It was concluded that both rock crushing and rock removal
   operations are at present detrimental to soil and water conservation. 
   However, if better soil/rock separation can be achieved during rock
   crushing, use of the crusher in stony fields is promising.}},

Abstract = {{Numbers of Sitobion avenae (F.) on the ears of control and defoliated

   soil quality or quantity of nitrogen fertilizer. The plants were
   defoliated after earing and aphid numbers on the ears of defoliated and
   adjacent control plants were checked at 5-6 clay intervals. Maximum
   numbers of aphids per ear were up to 2.5 times higher, and aphid loads
   up to 10 times greater on defoliated than control plants. The
   differences were proportional to the leaf area removed, and to the
   compensatory growth shown by the host plant. The increase in aphid
   numbers was directly proportional to the increase in chaff mass per
   seed. The physiological and biochemical changes in the defoliated plants
   that may cause the variation in aphid performance are discussed.}},

Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{An indigenous soil classification used in the caatinga region of Ceara
   State, Northeast Brazil, was mastered in the course of a resource
   inventory in the Acarau Valley. This paper considers its validity using
   (1) its usefulness as a tool for objectively grouping soils; and (2) the
   strength of the link between soil quality and class membership. Cluster
   analyses using morphological attributes from 36 profiles were used to
   determine how well the classification met the first criterion;
   percentage moisture equivalent and pH values were examined to assess the
   classification in terms of the second criterion. The classification's
   limitations and potential.for wider geographic application were assessed
   in conjunction with a farm survey covering a larger portion of Ceara
   State.
   The cluster analyses produced three major clusters that corresponded
   closely to the broad classes of the indigenous soil classification. This
   corroborated the validity of the indigenous classification as a tool for
   objectively grouping morphologically similar soils. However, it was
   noticed that class names, although extensively used, may have different
   meanings in physiographically contrasting regions. Because of this it is
   necessary to establish the local relationship between class name and
   soil characteristics. Intra-cluster percentage moisture equivalent and
   pH values varied widely but tended to concentrate in relatively narrow
   areas of the range of values for all three clusters. This demonstrated
   the usefulness of the indigenous classification as a framework to group
   soils physicochemically.}},

Abstract = {{The results presented in this report concern the biomass and mineral
   content of a first rotation plantation of Norway spruce (Picea abies
   Karst). The stand is situated in the western part of the Vosges
   mountains in the communal forest of Gemaingoutte. The brown soil,
   derived from a granito-gneissic bedrock, is acidic and relatively poor
   in `'basic cations''. No indicators of forest decline were observed on
   this highly productive stand. The aims of this study were to: collect
   data on immobilisation and uptake of nutrients in this highly productive
   spruce stand, which could be used in calculating input-output
   assessments on a seasonal, annual and pluriannual basis; provide results
   for a more general study on the manner in which a spruce ecosystem
   functions according to site characteristics, which would be of use in
   modelling the spruce ecosystem.
   A classical destructive sampling procedure was used: 15 trees were
   felled, biomass, and mineral content tables were established for the
   main tree components; these tables were used to evaluate the stand
   contents.
   The biomass of the stand was very high: 360 t for the stems, ie a volume
   of 900 m3, 470 t for the total stand including the root systems (cf
   table IV).
   The current uptake of the trees for N, P, K, Ca and Mg was 70.2, 4.9,
   23.6 24.1 and 4.4 kg respectively per ha per annum.
   The comparison between the actual available soil reserves and the
   immobilisation of nutrients within trees showed that these reserves were
   not sufficient to indefinitely sustain growth and that consequently soil
   fertility is a dynamic process linked to ecosystem input, ie atmospheric
   input and weathering (cf table VI). The fine earth of the soil
   constitutes a fairly large reservoir of nutrients. The question is
   raised regarding land use prior to planting the stand and the effect of
   this use on soil quality and therefore on growth of this first
   generation plantation.}},

Abstract = {{Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) composting is a rapidly evolving technology,
   and as such is subject to shifting policies and changing regulations.
   Composting is a viable way of recycling organic wastes which comprise a
   large fraction of the municipal solid waste stream, but there is debate
   about whether compost inputs should be restricted to source separated
   ``biowastes{''} or whether centralized processsing of mixed solid waste
   is acceptable. Several additional key policy issues include: how MSW
   composting fits into an integrated waste management system; compost
   quality standards and restrictions on compost utilization; facility
   siting, design, and operation; and regulatory enforcement. As with other
   policies and regulations, those related to MSW composting are influenced
   by a combination of science, economics, and philosophy  a, mediated by
   the political process. Current MSW compost regulations in North America
   and Europe provide examples of widely differing policy frameworks and
   the standards and criteria which result. Risk-based assessments drive
   compost standards in the United States, while a policy of ``no net
   degradation{''} of existing soil quality is the basis for standards in
   parts of Europe and Canada. These different policies result in large
   differences in the allowable levels of some heavy metals. Unrestricted
   use of ``clean{''} composts meeting quality standards is generally
   allowed under all regulations, but restrictions on the use of composts
   which may contain levels of one or more contaminant that exceed those
   standards vary. The underlying differences between these frameworks are
   described, and important uncertainties which research can help resolve
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{1. Five riparian herbaceous weeds, Leonotis nepetaefolia, Cassia tora,
   Ageratum conyzoides, Parthenium hysterophorus and Sida acuta, dominant
   on the banks of the Rihand river and Pant Sagar reservoir at Renukoot
   (India), were selected to assess experimentally their quantitative role
   in binding the soil, reducing water run-off and conserving phosphorus.
   Young seedlings from the banks were sown on sloping experimental garden
   plots. Simulated rainfall totalling 42.5 mm was applied at 30 cm h-1 on
   five vegetated and one bare plot.
   2. Run-off water and eroded soil were collected from each experimental
   plot in artificial reservoirs and their quantities measured. The soil,
   water and phosphorus conservation value of each of the five species were
   computed using the formula given by Ambasht (1970). The values for the
   five selected riparian herbs ranged between 33\% and 84\%, while water
   conservation values lay between 19\% and 50\%. Overall phosphorus
   conservation value, based on the losses in run-off water and eroded soil
   taken together, varied for total P from 41 to 63\%, for inorganic P from
   42 to 60\% and for organic P from 21 to 61\% under different species.
   3. The fraction of phosphorus transported down the slope was higher in
   run-off water (averaging 62\% total P, 53\% inorganic P and 72\% for
   organic P) than in eroded soil. The P concentration in run-off water was
   consistently greater than the critical levels associated with
   accelerated eutrophication of reservoir and lakes (10 mug l-1). 4. In a
   stepwise multiple regression equation comprising the four independent
   variables - canopy cover, litter mass, soil moisture and plant biomass -
   canopy cover explained 88\% (P < 0.01) of variability in inorganic P
   loss and its conservation by the five species. Nutrient losses through
   run-off water and eroded soil from vegetated and bare plots were
   compared to assess the role of these species in maintaining soil quality
   and fertility.}},

Abstract = {{The study was aimed at evaluating the efficiency of native rhizobia from
   soil samples of different regions of the Czech Republic and comparing it
   with low- and high-efficient strain Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae.
   The usefulness of pea seed inoculation grown in the given region should
   be assessed on the basis of these comparisons.
   Soil samples of 32 various areas used for farm purposes in the teritory
   of Bohemia and Moravia, soil samples were collected. (Tab. I gives the
   characteristics of soils and sites).  Dried soil samples were used for
   inoculation (5 g/plant) of Pisum sativum. The test plants were studied
   for nodulation, total nitrogenase activity (TNA) and plant biomass
   output. Two strains of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae were compared, that
   is: highly efficient strain 128C30 (acquired from the company Nitragin
   Co. USA) and low efficient isolate 44 (Luzany, Czechoslovakia). The test
   plants were cultivated hydroponically in perlite and supplied with
   nutrient solution without nitrogen. The trial was performed in
   glasshouse under artificial additional illumination and average daily
   temperature ranging from 20 to 24-degrees-C and night temperature of 15
   to 16-degrees-C and 16 hours of photoperiod.
   All studied parameters are summarized in Tab. II. After inoculation with
   soil samples, a sufficient number of nodules was formed in most cases,
   though their weight was mostly lower than that in the plants inoculated
   with the strain 128C30. TNA in the course of flower ranged from 11 to 91
   \% of highly efficient strain. Some soil samples exhibited the TNA
   values lower than in low-efficient isolate 44. The biomass output of
   plants ranged from 20 to 100 \% of the control strain 128C30.
   In general sense, after final assessment of the trial, it can be said
   that the nodulation by native rhizobia Originated from different regions
   of Bohemia and their efficiently of atmospheric nitrogen fixation was
   affected by more factors. One of them may be an altitude of the site.
   TNA value was lower along with above-ground mass output in the plants
   inoculated soil of the regions of higher altitude (Sumava 530 m, Kolovec
   450 m) in comparison with the plants inoculated with the soil from lower
   situated regions (Domamyslice 220 m, Detenice 280 m). This tendency may
   be associated with the fact that with higher altitudes, the soil quality
   is lower.The effect of an altitude cannot be generalized, as it can be
   seen on the example of soil from Becvary (230 m of altitude),where
   rhizobia were not of a high efficiency. Dowling, Broughton (1986) refer
   to soil properties as having a decisive effect on competitive and
   nodulation properties of rhizobia. After Mareckova (1983), low soil pH
   (3.5 to 5.3) may be one of the factors limiting the propagation of
   rhizobia in soil and their efficiency. This fact was manifested also in
   our trial, when in the case of acid soils from Kolovec (pH = 5.1) native
   rhizobia were of a low efficiency. At the same time it can be said that
   though soil conditions are adequate for native rhizobia and their amount
   in the soil is high, this fact cannot lead automatically to their high
   efficiency. Bottomley, Jenkins (1983) isolated a high number of strains
   R meliloti from uninoculated lucerne cultivated on the soils of Oregon
   (USA) and found that only a low per cent (12 \%) is highly efficient in
   N2 fixation. In our experiments inoculation by native rhizobia led also
   to lower nitrogenase activity and above-ground mass output in comparison
   with the efficient strain R leguminosarum bv. viciae 128C30. Neither
   soils sufficiently supplied with nutrients nor with an optimum pH value
   (e.g. from Slusovice) apparently contained rhizobia of above-average
   efficiency. However, not even in the case of Dalesice 1, where
   inoculation of pea seed was carried out in 1988, increased efficiency of
   native rhizobia was not observed.
   Counts of rhizobia direct in soils was not found in this study, though
   in the case of soils from submontane regions of Sumava and Becvary 3 one
   may conclude from a feeble nodulation that these soils did not contain a
   sufficient number of rhizobia. In the other soil samples, however,
   nodulation of test plants was adequate, though the nodules were usually
   of lower weight and TNA that the efficient strain 128C30. This lower
   efficiency could be manifested also through reduced plant biomass
   output. In this view, inoculation preparations may be recommended for
   inoculation of pes seed from most of these soils. The preparations
   should contain highly efficient competitive strains. As experiments were
   performed in different regions of Bohemia and Moravia, the
   recommendation may be extended also to the whole territory of the Czech
   Republic. If highly efficient strains comprised in preparations will be
   also highly competitive, their application should bring a required
   fruit.}},

   the diverse types of improvements that may result are reviewed These
   include the development of improved strains of edible mushroom; of new
   strains of lactic acid bacteria for use both for food and feed
   fermentations and the maintenance of animal health; the development of
   biopesticides; the protection of crop plants against frost damage; the
   development of microbes to improve soil quality. The impact of this new
   technology on agriculture, and safe routes to its exploitation are
   critically assessed.}},

Abstract = {{A major problem in site remediation is frequently the lack of
   appropriate standards for pollutants in soil. Lack of standards for an
   exposure route can result in subjective judgments regarding the extent
   of remediation needed. These problems are particularly important when
   considering the potential for groundwater contamination by inorganic
   materials. The partitioning of trace metals is highly dependent on the
   nature of the soil and on the solution pH. The maximum level of metal in
   soil for which the equilibrium soluble metal does not exceed the
   drinking water standard can be computed, at any pH, from the measured
   partition coefficient for any metal and soil.
   The sorption of cadmium and lead onto major types of New Jersey soil has
   been determined as a function of pH. As the pH decreased, the amount of
   adsorbed metal decreased.
   As is conventionally done, we have transformed these data into sorption
   coefficients (K(d)) which are a function of pH. To apply such data in
   the decision making process, it is necessary to use the K(d) and
   appropriate conditions of soil/groundwater in the environment. The
   calculation determines the maximum concentration of metal which will not
   result in exceedence of water quality standards. These criteria can be
   used as a soil standard which will be protective of groundwater quality.
   We developed adsorption/desorption relationships in the form of a
   mathematical model and computed the maximum level of metal in soil for
   which the equilibrium soluble metal will not exceed the drinking water
   standards.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of different light and soil nutrient conditions on foliar
   chemistry and acceptability of Inga oerstediana seedlings to leaf-cutter
   ants were investigated. I determined differences among (1) leaves that
   were initiated and matured under identical conditions but subsequently
   were subjected to different light and fertilization treatments and (2)
   leaves that were initiated and matured under different soil, light, and
   fertilization treatments. I also assessed the relationship between
   environmentally induced differences in plant growth and the production
   of carbon-based secondary chemicals (specifically, tannins). Finally, I
   determined whether increases in tannins corresponded to decreases in the
   acceptability of leaves to leaf-cutter ants.
   Once a leaf matured the concentrations of tannins did not change as a
   function of light and soil nutrient conditions despite very large
   differences in growth rates among the treatments. Leaves that expanded
   to maturity under different soil, light, and fertilization treatments
   did differ in tannin chemistry, and treatment differences in plant
   growth rates appeared to dictate tannin chemistry. When growth was light
   limited, tannin concentrations were low, but when growth was nutrient
   limited, tannin concentrations were high.
   Only leaves that expanded to maturity under different environmental
   conditions differed in their acceptability to leaf-cutter ants.
   Decreases in tannins did not result in parallel increases in
   acceptability. Despite higher concentrations of tannins, leaf-cutter
   ants preferred the leaves of seedlings that were grown at 20\% light
   over leaves of seedlings grown at 2\% light. However, fertilization
   increased the acceptability of leaves when seedlings were grown at 20\%
   light, a result consistent with the avoidance of very-high-tannin
   leaves.
   From these results I suggest that spatial variation in resource
   availability in lowland tropical rainforests would result in differences
   in tannin chemistry, and in susceptibility to leaf-cutter ants. However,
   temporal changes in resource availability would only be important to
   tannin chemistry and susceptibility if the duration of the change were
   long enough to allow new leaves to be produced.}},

   quality, N fertilization and presence of grapevines.  Soils were derived
   from three geological formations, each with a low and a high humus
   content.  The results, based on monthly sampling, can be summarized as
   following:  1. The annual changes of N(min) contents formerly observed
   in the soils of vineyards (MULLER 1985) were confirmed by the lysimeter
   experiments.  With all treatments, the N(min) levels of soils were
   highest during mid-summer and lowest during the cold season.  2. The
   annual occurrence of N(min) contents was mainly governed by soil
   temperature and frequency and quantity of precipitations.  3. The level
   of N(min) was also affected by the geological origin of soil material
   and the humus contents.  4. Muschelkalk soils, usually connected with
   high humus contents, regularly showed the highest N(min) levels.  5.
   Among soils of comparable humus contents, new red sandstone soil had
   always the highest, keuper soil the lowest levels of N(min).  Therefore,
   the humus contents of soils have to be rated with respect to their
   parent material.  6. As the meteorological conditions, geological
   formation and humus contents are specific of a vineyard site, the N(min)
   supply power of a certain soil is site-specific as well.  It can
   therefore not be judged by only one, momentary, N(min) test.  7. Mineral
   N fertilization always increased the N(min) contents, varying in
   relation to the meteorological and other conditions of a given site. 
   Without mineral N fertilization, the N(min) supply power - indicating a
   gradual reduction of the N reserves of the soil - continuously
   decreased.  8. The investigations verified that, under favourable
   conditions, mineral N fertilization causes a more or less strong priming
   effect, leading to excessively high N(min) contents over several weeks. 
   Occasionally, however, immobilization and incorporation of the mineral N
   fertilizer into the soil biomass (negative priming effect) was observed,
   either immediately after fertilization or after a short increase of
   N(min).  9. Vines growing in the lysimeters reduced the N(min) contents
   of soil not before the 3rd year of planting.  10. Use of shed soils,
   comparable to freshly trenched soils, caused - with all soil types -
   very intensive mineralization during the first 2 years of the experiment
   and corresponding high N(min) supply.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of crop rotations and various cultural practices on soil
   organic matter quantity and quality in a Rego, Black Chernozem with a
   thin A horizon were determined in a long-term study at Indian Head,
   Saskatchewan.  Variables examined included:  fertilization, cropping
   frequency, green manuring, and inclusion of grass-legume hay crop in
   predominantly spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production systems. 
   Generally, fertilizer increased soil organic C and microbial biomass in
   continuous wheat cropping but not in fallow-wheat or fallow-wheat-wheat
   rotations.  Soil organic C, C mineralization (respiration) and microbial
   biomass C and N increased (especially in the 7.5- to 15-cm depth) with
   increasing frequency of cropping and with the inclusion of legumes as
   green manure or hay crop in the rotation.  The influence of treatments
   on soil microbial biomass C (BC) was less pronounced than on microbial
   biomass N.  Carbon mineralization was a good index for delineating
   treatment effects.  Analysis of the microbial biomass C/N ratio
   indicated that the microbial suite may have been modified by the
   treatments that increased soil organic matter significantly.  The
   treatments had no effect on specific respiratory activity (CO2-C/BC). 
   However, it appeared that the microbial activity, in terms of
   respiration, was greater for systems with smaller microbial biomass. 
   Changes in amount and quality of the soil organic matter were associated
   with estimated amount and C and N content of plant residues returned to
   the soil.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the influence of weather patterns on the flowering of a C4
   plant, 11 transplant gardens were sown with seeds of Echinochloa
   crus-galli var. crus-galli within and beyond the species range.  Both
   the isolated effect of climate and the joint effect of competition and
   soil quality on the flowering of E. crus-galli were analyzed.  Although
   vegetative growth was significantly more vigorous in the southernmost
   site, Echinochloa plants were able to grow actively even at high
   latitudes.  Conversely, flowering decreased gradually from south to
   north.  The maximum temperature in August was the best predictor of
   floral emergence.  Data from controlled experiments confirmed that
   flowering of E. crus-galli was size independent, and temperature was
   shown to have an effect on biomass accumulation and allocation as well
   as on floral emergence.  Plants grown in the coolest thermoperiod
   produced a small number of heavy seeds, whose germinability was superior
   to that of plants grown in the other temperature treatments.  Finally,
   the results indicate that maternal families represent a significant
   source of variability for reproductive characteristics.  The presence of
   genetic effects suggests that E. crus-galli has the potential for
   further evolution with regard to temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Environment stress in the course of wheat development caused modified
   plant stature.  Below ground stress (poor soil quality and nutrition,
   drought) increased relative root size (root to shoot ratio).  Above
   ground stress (crop density) had the reverse effects, the plants were
   tall and the leaves great.  Any type of stress decreased plant size. 
   This variation affected plant qualities important for performance of
   Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker), Sitobion avenae (F.) and Rhopalosiphum
   padi (L.).  The abundance and impact on host plant of M. dirhodum and R.
   padi decreased with worsening plant quality (increasing root to shoot
   ratio and decreasing size).  The abundance of S. avenae was little
   influenced, or even increased on low quality plants on poor soils. 
   Proportions of different species in total aphid population also varied
   with plant quality and were similar in 1987-1989, even when annual
   variation of aphid abundance was great.  Proportion of aphids present on
   ears from the total aphid population on a plant increased, and the one
   present on leaves decreased with worsening plant quality.  The
   differences in aphid performance on low and high quality plants were
   related to variation in energy (dry mass) which a plant allocated to
   different organs.  Factors which determine these differences, overall
   intensity of environment stress on a host plant and its partitioning
   among below and above ground organs, were thus general determinants of
   aphid abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Lambert sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) established on Osoyoos loamy sand
   in 1983 was subjected to treatments involving all combinations of two
   types of irrigation (wellwater or municipal wastewater) and three rates
   of N fertilization (0, 68 and 136 g of N as NH4NO3 tree-1 yr-1),
   1984-1987.  The zero-N treatment was increased to 34 g N tree-1 in
   1986-1987.  Wastewater irrigation increased leaf N, P, K, B and Mn
   concentration, decreased leaf Mg and Ca and had few consistent effects
   on leaf Fe and Cu. Tree growth was increased after 2 yr but not after 5
   yr by wastewater irrigation.  Inadequate N and Zn nutrition appeared to
   limit long-term tree growth.  After 5 yr, wastewater-irrigated soils had
   higher extractable P, K, and B and lower Ca and Mg than
   well-water-irrigated soils which had higher Ca and Mg to 0.09-m depth. 
   Wastewater irrigation also increased extractable Na throughout the soil
   but insufficiently to adversely affect tree growth.  Soil pH and
   electrical conductivity also increased during the experiment for both
   well- and wastewater-irrigated soils, but these increases did not cause
   alkalinity or salinity problems.}},

Abstract = {{In pursuit of identifying sustainable agricultural production practices,
   there is an urgent need to develop or identify parameters that
   effectively describe and differentiate changes in the quality and
   quantity of soil organic matter resulting from crop management or
   cultural practices.  The effectiveness of the potentially mineralizable
   nitrogen (N0) concept for this purpose was examined using data from a
   30-yr crop rotation study, carried out on a Rego thin Black Chernozem at
   Indian Head, Saskatchewan.  Although Kjeldahl N and hydrolyzable soil
   amino-N are effective for demonstrating the beneficial influence of
   fertilizers, legumes and continuous cropping on total soil organic N
   content, they are less effective in identifying changes in organic
   matter quality.  We have shown that a parameter which we called the
   ``initial potential rate of N mineralization{''} {[}potentially
   mineralizable N (N0) x rate constant (k) at time = 0] was effective in
   distinguishing both the absolute and qualitative changes in soil organic
   N due to various cultural and management practices.  The results showed
   that fertilizers can be as effective as legumes, used either for green
   manure or for hay, in increasing the quantity and improving the quality
   of soil organic matter.  A 6-yr rotation including 1 yr of fallow, 2 yr
   of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and 3 yr of bromegrass (Bromus
   inermis Leyss) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay had a greater
   quantity and improved quality of soil organic N relative to that of
   unfertilized continuous wheat (Cont W), but the were equivalent to that
   of fertilized Cont W.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the competition between a maize crop and a natural population
   of barnyard grass Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.  The competition
   and soil quality affected growth rate, and individual dry mass of both
   plants.  Dry above ground standing crop of maize was reduced by
   competition and poor soil, the one of E. crus-galli varied little since
   the small individual size was compensated by increased plant numbers. 
   Root to shoot ratio of maize varied little.  In E. crus-galli it was
   more than 2 times greater in competing than control plants.  The ability
   to change the dry mass partitioning among roots and shoots may cause the
   competition superiority of E. crus-galli over maize.
   Numbers of aphids Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) and Rhopalosiphum padi
   (L.) were greater on vigorous (control) than stunted (competing) plants,
   due to greater immigration and population growth rates.  Abundance of
   predatory Coccinellidae and Syrphidae was also greater in stands of
   vigorous than stunted maize plants.  Surface activity of Carabidae and
   Araneae was influenced by microclimate which varied with density of E.
   crus-galli stand.  It is perhaps for the first time when the
   consequences of host plant competition for phytophagans and predators
   were established.}},

Abstract = {{When using fertilizers which contain dicyandiamide, the risk of
   fertilizer nitrate being translocated in the first weeks after
   application is significantly reduced.  In addition, the specific mode of
   action of these fertilizers has advantages for plant production.  Trials
   over several years with potato gave the following results:  1. 
   Potatoes, mainly grown on light soils, generally gave increased tuber
   yields following the application of an N-fertilizer containing
   dicyandiamide, compared to a conventional N-fertilizer (+ 2.4 t/ha, mean
   of 12 trials).
   2.  In addition to higher tuber yield, starch content of the tubers was
   increased by 0.2 \% and nitrate content decreased by 39 ppm to 66 ppm on
   average.  The higher N-uptake, compared to ammonium sulfate nitrate,
   resulted in lower N(min)-contents after harvest.
   3.  The effect on yield and quality of the potato crop was largely
   site-independent, there was no relation between additional yield and
   soil quality or precipitation rate at the site of the trial.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents soil biological data from a study on the functioning
   of three soil-plant systems on a Gray Luvisol in Cryoboreal Subhumid
   central Alberta.  The systems were (1) an agroecological 8-year
   rotation, (2) a continuous grain system, both established in 1981, and
   (3) a classical Breton 5-year rotation established in 1930.  The
   objectives were to (1) determine whether changes in vesicular-arbuscular
   mycorrhizae (VAM) populations occurred in soil under these cropping
   systems, (2) discover whether these cropping systems and/or VAM
   infection influenced the incidence of common root rot (Bipolaris
   sorokiniana), and (3) use nutrient translocation indices to test the
   hypothesis that soil quality influences non-specific physiological
   conditions in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).  VAM fungal propagules in
   soil samples and VAM infection under controlled conditions were
   significantly affected by the cropping system.  VAM infection accounted
   for more than 85\% of the variability in grain yield, plant biomass
   yield, and plant uptake of K, S, Ca, Fe, and Zn under controlled
   conditions.  Backward-elimination regression analyses showed that under
   these conditions of high available P, plant P uptake was governed by the
   quantity of extractable P in the soil (r2 = 0.82); the VAM infection
   contributed practically nothing when combined with available P (R2 =
   0.84).  Neither VAM infection nor the cropping system were related to
   the B. sorokiniana infection in the barley.  The growth of B.
   sorokiniana was equal, and its sporulation superior, when grown on
   residues of the non-host fababean (Vicia faba L.), compared with growth
   on residues of barley.  Higher translocation of plant nutrients to the
   grain in the agroecological compared with the continuous grain
   treatments suggested that VAM and/or the soil history affected plant
   physiology, possible through hormonal effects.  Superior barley yields
   in the agroecological compared with the continuous grain treatments were
   partly due to increased VAM colonization, greater nutrient accumulation
   and translocation to the grain, but not to a reduced disease incidence. 
   These results demonstrate the benefits of a holistic systems approach
   while studying biological interactions involving plants and groups of
   soil microorganisms.}},

Abstract = {{The Chernobyl accident in 1986 was followed by considerable depositions
   of radionuclides. In the Federal Republic of Germany the highest
   depositions have been observed in the southern part of Bavaria so that
   at the beginning contamination of milk with the radionuclides J-131,
   Cs-134, and Cs-137 was about one order of magnitude higher in that
   region than in the other parts of the country. After feeding of the
   plant material contaminated via foliage directly out of the atmosphere
   the transfer of caesium radioisotopes from soil to plants via roots
   tended to play the dominant role. As a consequence some ecological
   factors, mainly soil quality, got an important influence on
   contamination of plants and milk by caesium isotopes. Meanwhile activity
   concentrations for caesium radionuclides in milk in the northern part of
   Germany are higher than those in southern Bavaria where a tenfold higher
   depositions had been observed. The reasons are the unfavourable transfer
   conditions on the poor sandy and peat soils dominant in the north.}},

Abstract = {{Field trials at a control site (Ruzyne) were performed to study the
   growth and development of six selected wheat varieties (Viginta, Regina,
   Sparta, Kosutka, Selekta, Iris) in emission area with poorer soil
   quality where pH is 4.5 to 5.0 (Chomutov) and laboratory and pot trials
   were carried out in the glasshouse with two types of soils (Luvisol of
   high quality, with pH 6.8 to 7.2 and the soil from the site where PH is
   3.5 to 4.0, occurrence of heavy metals, Al3+ toxicity, influence of
   emissions) and the following results were obtained: Laboratory and
   glasshouse trials testing the selected morphological, yield and growth
   characteristics confirmed the possibility to predict the performance of
   varieties in the areas with deteriorated soil affected by exhalations.
   As the most sensitive parts of plants answering to the given stress
   factors are considered to be root system and the number of spikelets per
   spike. A marked difference has been found out between soils as well as
   between replicated trials as far as volume, leaf area, grain weight in
   spike and the average of internode near surface are concerned. The
   varieties being in performance above average in exposed locality must
   have three prerequisites: above-average mass of above-ground biomass,
   above-average volume of root system and high degree of resistance to
   stress soil factors (Viginta, Regina). The variety which does not meet
   all these three prerequisitions will hardly reach a good performance at
   an exposed site (Kosutka, Selekta). The mentioned conclusions were
   repeatedly confirmed on the basis of evaluation of another set of
   varieties. It follows from the results that there is a real possibility
   to select wheat varieties for worsened soil and atmospheric conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Few goals of American farm policy have historically received more
   broad-based support from all sides of public opinion than soil
   conservation.  Because of general concern about the impact of soil
   quality on food availability and prices, and given the dramatic context
   of the thirties, which associated economic depression and unemployment
   with the ``dustbowl{''}, the fight against soil erosion is synonymous
   with social and economic progress.
   Thus it is not surprising that soil conservation measures became a
   permanent component of American farm policy and that their renewal never
   rise serious dispute (nor did Food Stamps, another popular farm
   program).  Moreover, these two kinds of programs were often the
   necessary condition in order to ensure the support of urban lobbies for
   farm programs.  Soil conservation, as a secondary objective of the
   commodity set aside programs became a catalyst in the adoption of
   certain farm policies.
   However the rationale behind these programs is progressively moving from
   concern about maintenance of soil fertility and through this about the
   availability of food products towards broader impact of agricultural
   practices on the environment.
   The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the role of soil conservation
   programs and concerns in the evolution of American farm policy and its
   place in the current farm policy crisis.  A brief historical background
   of U.S. soil conservation policy is presented in the first section,
   followed by a critical description of the major soil conservation
   programs.  Regulation theory is then used to analyse the crisis of the
   Fordist model of agricultural policy.  The status of soil conservation
   programs in the context of farm policy crisis is discussed in the fourth
   section.  Finally, implications of the U.S. experience for Canadian farm
   policy are presented.}},

Abstract = {{A 5-yr study was conducted in the County of Newell to monitor soil
   salinity and sodicity, water-table levels and crop production on
   Solonetzic soil associations under normal irrigation management
   practices.  All soil associations consisted of at least 50 percent
   Solonetzic Order soils, with Brown Solod as the dominant subgroup at all
   but one site.  Changes in soil quality were monitored through regular
   measurements of water-table levels, annual fall sampling and chemical
   analysis of soils.  Irrigation practises used by farmers did not
   permanently raise water-table levels at any of the sites irrigated by
   center pivots.  Changes in soil salinity or sodicity as a result of
   irrigation were generally not statistically significant, suggesting that
   the salt status of soils at most sites did not change appreciably over
   the 5-yr period.  The relatively low productive capability of land units
   dominated by Solonetzic soils was evident in the low yield and by a high
   degree of variability in yield within individual sites.  Careful
   irrigation management partially compensated for some of the soil
   limitations in these Solonetzic soil landscapes; however, due to the low
   productivity observed, modification of existing land classification
   standards to allow irrigation of Solonetzic soils is not presently
   recommended.}},

Title = {{APPLICABILITY OF 0.01 M CACL2 AS A SINGLE EXTRACTION SOLUTION FOR THE

Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS}},

Abstract = {{The applicability of 0.01 M CaCl2 solution as a single extraction agent
   for soils as a basis for fertilizer recommendation was tested on a
   variety of soils both from the Netherlands and from some tropical
   countries.  Air-dry soil samples were subjected to extraction with 0.01
   M CaCl2 and to several conventional extraction procedures, and the
   results were compared.  In the soil suspensions pH was measured, whereas
   in the extracts Na, K, Mg, P, different extractable N-forms and Zn were
   measured.  The values found in CaCl2 extracts are discussed in relation
   to results of other extraction procedures and as to their potential
   value in soil quality assessment.  It is concluded that a a single
   extraction procedure with 0.01 M CaCl2 can be applied for fertilizer
   recommendation purposes.  The possibility of determining different
   extractable N-forms (NH4, NO3, soluble organic N) significantly enhances
   the value of the method in predicting the N-fertilizer needs. 
   Furthermore it was found that the concentration of Zn in 0.01 M CaCl2
   extracts was a good indicator of phytotoxicity in a polluted area. 
   Additional advantages of this extraction are low costs, simplicity and
   reproducibility.}},

   and their contribution to soil structure or microfabric are discussed
   within the context of recent Canadian glacial history and current

   reviewed.  Direct imaging of soil biotic activity through the use of
   rhizotrons or microscopic analysis of intact soil is discussed.
   Generally, the most widespread and disruptive agricultural practices to
   soil quality are deforestation and conventional tillage.  Sustainable
   agricultural practices such as reduced tillage and pesticide inputs are
   less damaging to soil fauna.  Cropping systems will have to be devised
   that balance optimum crop production with maintenance of sufficient
   organic matter in the soil to provide for soil faunal activity.}},
